Q2 2023 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2023
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Hello and welcome to Citi's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Review with the Chief Executive Officer,
Jane Fraser; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi
Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which
time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is
being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
Ms. Landis, you may begin.

Jennifer Landis
Head-Investor Relations, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's
presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking
statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in
circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including
those described in our earnings materials as well as in our SEC filings.
And with that, I will turn it over to Jane.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Jen, and good morning to everyone. While this quarter wasn't as eventful as the first quarter, it was
not without its moments. The global economy continues to be remarkably resilient, although the macro backdrop
differs across key markets. And while the bulk of the tightening is behind us, central banks are responding
vigorously to inflation and have made it clear the cycle hikes isn't over.
In the US, the tight labor market keeps pushing the timing of this elusive recession later into this year or 2024,
with the robust demand for services providing a backstop for the economy. The US earnings has also exceeded
expectations, however most countries there are facing pressure from labor and energy costs, challenging the
region's longer-term competitiveness.
China is the biggest disappointment as growth decelerated after an initial post-reopening pop. I was there last
month and let's just say a few on the ground expect China to be as strong a driver of global growth this year as
some have hoped. So, bottom line, globally we continue to see the same quite challenging macroeconomic
conditions that we saw in the first quarter, From Citi's perspective, we continue to see the benefits of our
diversified business model and strong balance sheet. We remain laser-focused on executing our strategy and
simplifying and modernizing our bank.
Despite the turbulence and macro backdrop of the first-half, we're on track with the plan we laid out at Investor
Day and we remain committed to our strategy and our medium-term RoTCE target. Today, we reported net
income of $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33. Our revenues, ex-divestitures, are relatively flat to last year and we
remain on track to meet our revenue guidance of $78 billion to $79 billion for the year. We're also on track to meet
the expense guidance for the year. And consistent with the plan we shared with you at our Investor Day, we are
pursuing cost-saving opportunities to help offset the significant investments in our transformation.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2023
In Services, TTS continues to deliver with revenues up a healthy 15%. This was driven by both net interest
income and non-interest revenue as we win fee-generating mandates with new clients and deepen our
relationships with existing large Corporate and Commercial clients. We're proud of our number one ranking for
large institutional clients, and this week we announced our latest innovation, CitiDirect Commercial Banking, a
digital platform to help our growing Commercial clients tap into our global network.
Securities Services revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies. We're really
pleased with execution in this business as we continue to bring in assets under custody and administration which
are up by approximately $2.4 trillion in the last year. We've gained 100 basis points in share year-over-year as a
result of the investments we've been making.
Markets revenues were down 13% compared to an exceptionally strong second quarter last year. From early
April, clients stood on the sidelines as the debt ceiling played out and we continued to experience very low levels
of volatility throughout the quarter. Despite this, our Corporate client flows remained strong and we achieved our
medium-term revenue-to-RWA target again this quarter.
In Banking, the momentum in investment-grade debt has spread into other DCM products, but the long-awaited
rebound in Investment Banking has yet to materialize and it was a disappointing quarter in terms of both the
wallet and our own performance with Investment Banking revenues down 24%. We continue to right-size the
business through the environment whilst making investments in selected areas such as technology and
healthcare.
In the US, taken together, our Cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth, aided by customer
engagement and the continued normalization in payment rates. In Branded Cards, spend is still strong in travel
and entertainment and acquisitions remain pretty healthy. This is a great franchise and we have launched a raft of
new innovations from transforming our ThankYou Rewards platform to our enhanced value proposition for the
premium card with our long-term partner, American Airlines.
Credit normalization is happening faster in Retail Services, given the profile of the portfolio and overall I would say
we're seeing a more cautious consumer but not necessarily a recessionary one. Wealth revenues were down 5%
as the business continues to be negatively impacted by the deposit mix shift, particularly in the Private Bank and
by lower investment revenues. However, we have seen activity pick up a bit in Asia for two quarters with growing
net new assets, referrals from the US retail banks are increasing and globally new client acquisition in the Private
Bank and Wealth at Work has grown significantly on the back of our investments in our network of client advisors
and bankers.
Turning to expenses, they were elevated this quarter as we expected. This includes the additional repositioning
actions we took to right-size certain businesses and functions in light of the current environment. Year-to-date,
severance is about $450 million including $200 million in the quarter.
Separate to repositioning, we remain committed to bending our expense curve by the end of 2024 through three
significant efforts: First, we continue to make investments in our transformation and other risk and control
initiatives, which are necessary to modernize our infrastructure, automate our controls as well as to improve the
client experience. As we said before, we will start to see the more material benefits of these investments over the
medium-term.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2023
Second, as part of our simplification efforts we expect to close the sales of our remaining two Asia consumer
franchises by year-end and we plan to restart the exit process in Poland. As you can see on the slide, we made
excellent progress this quarter in the consumer businesses we're winding down, aided by material asset sales
and we are now attacking stranded costs and closing out the TSAs in the markets that we have already exited.
You saw our determination to execute when we decided to IPO Banamex after exploring a sale. We should
complete the process of separating the two businesses fully next year in preparation for the IPO and I'm pleased
with the progress on the ground. We are about to begin acceptance testing on the new systems for the retained
businesses. All this means that by year-end, considering how far the divestitures and wind-downs have
progressed, Legacy Franchises will have materially reduced its exposures and primarily be down to Mexico,
Poland, Korea and the elimination of the remaining stranded costs.
As such, as we move through the second half of the year, we will be in a position to focus on the third leg of
bringing down our expense base through a leaner organizational model. Together, these three efforts are why we
have confidence in saying that we will start to bend the curve on an absolute basis by the end of 2024 and
continue to bring down expenses over the medium-term.
Let me end with capital. While you won't be shocked to hear that we were disappointed with the increase to our
stress capital buffer, we have engaged in active dialogue with the Fed to better understand the differences
between our model and theirs in terms of non-interest revenue and the industry awaits further clarity on capital
requirements and importantly their implementation timing from the holistic review the regulators have undertaken
and the expected Basel III Endgame NPR. There is still uncertainty as to what the final rules will be and we, like
the rest of the industry, will need to work through the implication. The exit of 14 international consumer markets,
coupled with the results of our transformation investments and change in business mix, will help reduce our
capital ratios. In addition, we have other levers to pull over time such as capital allocation, DTA utilization, our
GSIB score and our management buffer of 100 basis points.
We are committed to returning capital to our shareholders. As you saw with our decisions to repurchase $1 billion
in common stock and increase the dividend. We ended the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.3%. That's 100
basis points above our upcoming requirement after returning a total of $2 billion in capital and we grew our
tangible book value per share to $85.34. Given the environment, we will continue to look at our level of capital
return on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made but there remains a lot to do. We will continue to update you
on the progress we are making every quarter.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark and then we would both be delighted, as always, to take your
questions.

Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results focusing on year-
over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I indicate otherwise and spend a little more time on
expenses and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment.
On slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the second quarter, we reported net income of
approximately $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33 and an RoTCE of 6.4% on $19.4 billion of revenues. Embedded in
these results are after-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $92 million. Excluding these items, EPS
was $1.37 with an RoTCE of 6.6%.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2023
In the quarter, total revenues decreased by 1% both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture-related impacts
as strength across Services, US Personal Banking and revenue from the Investment portfolio was more than
offset by declines in Markets, Investment Banking and Wealth as well as the revenue reduction from the closed
exits and wind-downs.
Our results include expenses of $13.6 billion, up 9%, both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture-related
costs. Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in Cards net
credit losses and ACL builds largely related to growth in card balances. Our effective tax rate this quarter was
27% primarily driven by the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings in the quarter. Excluding current quarter
divestiture-related impacts, our effective tax rate was 26%. At the end of the quarter, we had over $20 billion in
total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7%, and through the first-half of 2023, we
reported an RoTCE of 8.7%.
On slide 5, we show the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year expense variance for the second quarter.
Expenses were up 9%, driven by a number of factors including investment in risk and controls, business-led and
enterprise-led investments, volume growth and macro factors including inflation as well as severance and all of
this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exits and wind-downs.
Severance in the quarter was approximately $200 million and $450 million year-to-date as we took further actions
across Investment Banking, Markets and the functions. We're investing in the execution of our transformation and
continue to see a shift in our investments from third-party consulting to technology and full-time employees. And
as we said last quarter, our transformation in technology investments span across the following themes: Platform
and process simplification, security and infrastructure modernization, client experience enhancements and data
improvements. And across these themes, technology spend was $3 billion in the quarter, up 13% primarily driven
by change in the bank spend. Despite the higher expense base sequentially, we remain in-line with our full-year
guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding divestiture-related impacts and the FDIC special assessment.
On slide 6, we show net interest income, deposits and loans where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the
second quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $550 million largely driven by dividends. The
increase in net interest income ex-Markets was largely driven by higher rates and Cards growth, partially offset by
the mix shift that we've seen to higher rate deposit products within PBWM.
Average loans were flat as growth in PBWM was offset by the wind-down in Markets and a decline in ICG as we
continue to optimize the loan portfolio, including a further reduction in subscription credit facilities. Average
deposits were down 2%, largely driven by TTS revenues as we saw some non-operational outflow as expected in
light of quantitative tightening. However, underlying this, we did see strong growth in operating accounts as we
continue to win new clients and deepen with existing ones and our net interest margin increased 7 basis points.
On slide 7, we show key Consumer and Corporate credit metrics. We're well-reserved for the current environment
with over $20 billion of total reserves. Our reserves-to-funded loans ratio is approximately 2.7% and within that
US Cards is 7.9%. In PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in US Cards, and of that exposure 80% is to
customers with FICOs of 680 or higher. And NCL rates are still below pre-COVID levels and are normalizing in-
line with our expectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely in Wealth, predominantly
in mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment-
grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment-grade or exposure to multinational clients
or their subsidiaries, and Corporate non-accrual loans remain low at about 44 basis points of total loans. As you
can see on the page, we break out our commercial real estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM, which

total $66 billion, of which 90% is investment-grade. So, while the macro and geopolitical environment remains
uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels and we continuously review
and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios.
On slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very
strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet, which is funded, in part, by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across
regions, industries, customers and account types, which is deployed into high-quality, diversified assets. Our
balance sheet reflects our strategy and well-diversified business model. We leverage our unique assets and
capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors and individuals with global needs. The majority of
our deposits, $818 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries. These
institutional deposits are complemented by $427 billion of US Retail Consumer and Global Wealth deposits as
you can see on the bottom right-side of the page. We have approximately $584 billion of HQLA and approximately
$661 billion of loans and we maintain total liquidity resources of just under $1 trillion. Our LCR was relatively
stable at 119% and our net stable funding ratio was greater than 100%. We ended the quarter with a 13.3% CET1
ratio and our tangible book value per share was $85.34, up 6% from a year ago.
On slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more details on the drivers this quarter. Starting from the
end of the first quarter, first, we generated $2.6 billion of net income-to-common, which added 22 basis points.
Second, we returned $2 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases which drove a reduction
of about 18 basis points, and finally the remaining 14-basis point decrease was primarily driven by RWA growth
as we continued to grow card balances, partially offset by optimizing RWA in Markets and Corporate Lending.
We ended the quarter with a 13.3% CET1 capital ratio, which includes 100 basis point internal management
buffer. We expect our regulatory capital requirement to be 12.3% in October of 2023 which incorporates the
increase in our stress capital buffer from 4% to the preliminary SCB of 4.3% we announced a couple of weeks
ago. And we will continue our dialogue with the Fed to better understand the differences between their modeled
results and ours, specifically in non-interest revenue. That said, our strategy is designed to further diversify our
business mix to have a more consistent, predictable and repeatable revenue stream as well as reduce risks and
simplify our firm by exiting 14 international consumer markets.
The strategy and the simplification, coupled with the benefits of our transformation investments, will allow us to
improve RWA and capital over time. The continued optimization of our balance sheet should not only help SCB
but reduce RWA. This will offset some of the anticipated headwinds in capital requirements and RWA, and we will
continue to reassess how and where we deploy capital and we will continue to reassess the appropriate level of
our management buffer over time.
On slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the second quarter. Revenues were down
9% this quarter as growth in Services was more than offset by Markets and Banking. Expenses increased 13%
primarily driven by continued investments in TTS and risk and controls as well as approximately $120 million of
severance in Investment Banking and Markets partially offset by productivity savings.
Cost of credit was $58 million as net credit losses were partially offset by an ACL release. This resulted in net
income of approximately $2.2 billion, down 45% primarily driven by lower revenues and higher expenses. ICG
delivered an RoTCE of 9.2% for the quarter and 11.4% through the first-half of 2023. Average loans were down
6%, reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns. Average deposits were up 1% as we continued to
acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2023
On slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In
Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 15% driven by 18% growth in net interest income and 8% in
non-interest revenue. It's also worth noting that TTS revenues were up 20% on an ex-FX basis. We continue to
see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with US dollar clearing
volumes up 6%, both in the quarter and through the first-half, cross-border flows up 11% outpacing global GDP
growth, again both in the quarter and through the first half, and commercial card volumes up roughly 15% led by
spend in travel. In fact, similar to the last few quarters, client wins are up approximately 41% across all client
segments. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank.
In Securities Services, revenues were also up 15% driven by higher net interest income across currencies. We
are pleased with the progress in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and
administration, which are up approximately 11% or $2.4 trillion and we feel very good about the pipeline of new
deals in Securities Services. As a reminder, the Services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our
higher-returning businesses with strong synergies across the firm.
Markets revenues were down 13% driven by both Fixed Income and Equities relative to an exceptional quarter
last year, coupled with low volatility this quarter. Fixed Income revenues were down 13% as strength in our Rates
franchise was more than offset by a decline in Currencies and Commodities. Equities revenues were down 10%,
primarily reflecting a decline in Equity Derivatives but consistent with our strategy, we continue to grow prime
balances driven by client wins. Corporate client flows remained strong and stable and we continued to make solid
progress on our revenue-to-RWA target.
And, finally, Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 22% driven by Investment
Banking as heightened macro uncertainty continued to impact client activity as well as lower revenues in
Corporate Lending. While we continue to have a strong pipeline and are seeing green shoots of activity, we
recognize there's more work to do in ECM and M&A. That said, we believe the investments that we've made in
healthcare and technology coverage will benefit us over time. So, overall, while the market environment remains
challenging and there's more work to be done, we're making progress against our strategy in ICG.
Now turning to slide 12 we show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business.
Revenues were up 6%, driven by net interest income growth of 7% partially offset by a 6% decline in non-interest
revenue, driven by lower investment product revenues in Wealth. Expenses were up 5%, predominantly driven by
risk and control investments. Cost of credit was $1.6 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to
see normalization in our card portfolios and a reserve build of approximately $335 million, primarily driven by card
balance growth. Average loans increased 7% driven by Cards, Mortgages and Installment Lending. Average
deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting our Wealth clients putting cash to work and Fixed Income investments
on our platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 5.5%, both for this quarter and through the first-half of 2023,
largely reflecting the challenging environment for Wealth and higher credit cost.
On slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded Cards
revenues were up 8%, primarily driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying
drivers with new account acquisitions up 6%, card spend volumes up 4% and average loans up 14%. Retail
Services revenues were up 27%, driven by higher net interest income and lower partner payments. For both card
portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline and that combined with the investments that we've been
making contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 17% in Branded Cards and 12% in Retail Services.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2023
Retail Banking revenues decreased 9% reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our
Wealth business. In fact, consistent with our strategy, we continued to leverage our Retail network to drive 25,000
Wealth referrals year-to-date through May, up 18% year-over-year.
Wealth revenues were down 5%, driven by continued investment fee headwinds and higher deposit costs
particularly in the Private Bank. However, Wealth at Work revenues were up over 30%, driven by strong lending
results primarily in mortgages. Client advisors were down 1%, reflecting the re-pacing of strategic hiring and new
client acquisitions were up nearly 40% in the Private Bank and approximately 60% in Wealth at Work in the
second quarter. While there's clearly more work to do in Wealth, we are seeing good momentum in the underlying
drivers.
On slide 14, we show results for Legacy Franchises. Revenues were down 1% as the benefit of higher rates and
volumes in Mexico was more than offset by the reductions from closed consumer exits and wind-downs. It's worth
noting that Mexico's revenues were up 22% and 10% ex-FX. Expenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by closed
consumer exits and wind-downs. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, expenses decreased 8%.
On slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other for the second quarter. Revenues increased, largely driven by
higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses also increased, driven by inflation and severance.
On slide 16, I'll briefly touch on our third quarter and full-year 2023 outlook. We are maintaining our full-year
revenue guidance of $78 billion to $79 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts although the mix has
shifted somewhat.
We are increasing our net interest income guidance from $45 billion to slightly above $46 billion for the full-year
excluding Markets, offset by lower non-interest revenue, largely driven by Investment Banking and Wealth. We
are also maintaining our expense guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts and
the FDIC special assessment.
Net credit losses in Cards should continue to normalize in the remainder of the year with both portfolios reaching
normalized levels by year-end and we now expect the full-year tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding
discrete items and divestiture-related impacts.
As it relates to the third quarter, we expect continued momentum with clients including fees and benefits from US
and non-US rates on NII. We also anticipate a sequential increase in expenses driven by continued investments
in transformation and risk and controls. Net credit losses in Cards should continue to normalize in-line with
expectations and our effective tax rate for the quarter should be approximately 25%, excluding discrete items and
divestiture-related impacts. And as it relates to buybacks, we will continue to make that decision on a quarter-by-
quarter basis.
Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few points. We continue to execute on the strategy to simplify our
firm, improve our revenue mix and bring both expenses and capital down over time. We're seeing solid
momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses. And as we said at Investor Day the
financial path will not be linear but we remain focused on achieving our medium-term RoTCE target.
And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. So I'm very curious on the whole revenue-to-RWA topic especially with some of the
changes coming in. So maybe you could give a little more color on, let's say, for instance the further reduction in
the subscription credit facility. I think I read somewhere that was like an $80 billion book down to $20 billion. You
can correct that if that's wrong but just usually those things are big important clients that have relationship lending
things attached to them, so I'm curious on how you balance the capital benefit, the clear capital benefit, versus the
client impact and how you think about that? Are there other blocks of business that are in motion right now?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Thanks, Glenn, and good morning. Thanks for the question. Look, a couple of points on that. One is we've been
very focused on the revenue-to-RWA metric in our Markets business and the ICG more broadly as well and we've
made considerable progress on that. And that's important because how we use the balance sheet in assuring that
we're optimizing the use of the balance sheet contributes to how we improve returns over time. You're right to
point out the subscription credit facility lending that we do. We brought that down pretty significantly. The numbers
you highlight are a lot higher than the portfolio. But what's important here is that as we look at that, we look at a
couple things:
So, one, the nature of the relationship and whether clients are taking advantage of the breadth of what we have to
offer. Two, the profitability and returns associated with the product to the extent that it is in a broader relationship.
And where those returns are low, sub-par and the prospect for doing more has proven to be fruitless, we take it
down and that's what we've done with a large part of that book just as we juxtapose it against other opportunities
to use balance sheet where clients are taking advantage of the broader franchise and therefore are generating
higher returns and we're going to continue to do that. We've done that to drive the revenue-to-RWA metric. We've
done it selectively on pieces of the portfolio like SCF. We've also looked at our broader Corporate Lending
portfolio and where those promises for higher relationship returns aren't manifesting themselves, we've not
renewed those loans. And as we think about pending regulatory changes, proactively making these efforts
becomes critically important.
When I look back on the activity that we've done over the past couple of years, we've reduced RWA by
approximately $120 billion over the last two years and about 75% of that is predominantly driven by balance sheet
optimization and looking at client activity that has low-margin business and so this is important for us to do. We're
going to keep doing.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I appreciate that, Mark. Maybe just a quick follow-up. On NII, I asked this last quarter too and your first-half
annualized ex-Markets is running about $1.5 billion ahead of the guide. Is that just the unpredictable nature of all
of the moving parts, trying to be conservative, or anything else in the back-half that you're thinking about?

Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Thanks, Glenn. Yeah. We did take guidance up to above – slightly above $46 billion from the $45 billion. I guess
there are a couple things – in ex-Markets of course, there are a couple things to think about in terms of headwinds
and tailwinds that play through there.
One is you've heard me mention before that we've reached terminal betas in the US. Two, deposit volumes and
the shift mix as we see consumers kind of move into higher-returning type – higher-yielding type products; and
three, really the wind-downs and the exits and the reduction that they will play out in terms of NII. So, those are
kind of three headwinds as we think about the forecast and the balance of the year. There are obviously some
potential tailwinds that play to the other side, including rate movements in non-US dollar as well as card volume
growth. And as we look at those headwinds and tailwinds, our current read is to take it up but $46 billion or slightly
above, that feels like the right level in the context of total revenues at $78 billion to $79 billion.

James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Maybe just getting on the expense side. You're keeping Mexico till 2025 now at the earliest,
so that will be on the books longer. How do we think about that bend the curve discussion and maybe specifically
you can help us think about bending the curve for the non-legacy businesses. Do we start to see, is the fourth
quarter just a slowing or quarterly decline? Is it a year-over-year kind of discussion? Just want to make sure I
understand the whole bend the curve notion and how to think about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. Let me take that. I'd say a couple things: So, one, I'd reiterate the expense guidance that we've
given for the full-year, so that's the roughly $54 billion ex-divestitures or the impact of divestitures, ex any impact
from FDIC special assessment.
Two, as we think about bending the curve, I look into 2024 and we're looking to bring the absolute expense
dollars down from Q3 to Q4, so that bending of the curve will occur. It will occur despite having Mexico still part of
the franchise. Obviously, still having Mexico impacts the magnitude of the bend but it will bend Q3 to Q4. And
then beyond that and through the medium-term, we will see the curve continue to bend. Again, Mexico impacts
the magnitude of the bend but we're very, very focused on bringing our cost down and bending that curve. And
you've heard us reference the aspects or the elements of our business that help contribute to that. Not the least of
which are the exits, one of which is Mexico and you referenced the timing there but also the benefits from the
investments that we've been making in transformation and risk and controls, and shifting from manual processes
to technology-enabled ones, and then the final one is around simplifying our organization. And you heard in
Jane's prepared remarks as we continue to make progress on these exits, it opens up the opportunity for us to
lean more heavily into that simplification. So, we are focused on not only the guidance but the bending of the
curve as you point out and looking forward to delivering that and taking actions to ensure we do.

So just as a follow-up, is the way to think about sort of 2025 and beyond as you get through a lot of the
automation on the sort of the non-legacy businesses and start to get much more efficient there. Can we – is there
an absolute expense decline story in the core business or is that more of a you need the top line growth to get the
improved returns?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Again, it's going to be a combination of continuing to bend-the curve and bring our expenses down. Obviously,
we've given you guidance on operating efficiency of less than 60%, which will be some of that top line growth but
it's the combination of the two.

Hey, Betsy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I just wanted to confirm on the CET1, you have 100 basis point buffer on top of regulatory minimums, so that
would suggest that the 13.3% that you got this quarter is in-line with where you're planning on holding it going
forward, is that fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. So you're right. We hit 13.3% this quarter, down a tad bit from the 13.4% last quarter. Effective October 1,
the 4.3% SCB comes into play and so that would equate to assuming the 100 basis point management buffer at
12.3% regulatory requirement and a 13.3% kind of target that we would management too.
I'd highlight a couple things that I'm sure are obvious to you, Betsy. One is this is – the stress capital buffer for the
12-month period starting October 1; and two is the strategy that we have described and talked about and have
started to execute against is intentionally designed to help morph the business towards a more steady,
predictable, consistent stream of revenues – fee revenue growth as well as bring our expenses down over time
and exit these markets, and those things should contribute to reducing our stress capital buffer over time and
improving our returns. But the answer to your question very directly is, yes, the 13.3% would reflect where we'd
be targeting as of October 1 for now.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And since you mentioned you're evaluating buybacks quarter-by-quarter, I guess the question here is how should
I think about that relative to we get (sic) Basel III Endgame coming out soon. Because clearly when you're at
13.3% against the new rate cap, SCB, it signals a bigger opportunity for buybacks over the coming quarter, so
how should I think about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
I think consistent with what we've been talking about, there's a lot of uncertainty out there about the new capital
requirements, both in terms of the nature of them and the timing of implementation. I think the industry is
expecting to get more clarity about that with the comment period that will be coming up, plus it's a fairly uncertain
macroeconomic environment at the moment, so both Mark and I feel it's prudent to continue making that
assessment until some of this uncertainty is clarified as to what precisely we'll do. You should take confidence
that we're at the levels, including the management buffer that we expect to be for the rest of the year.
We've proven a good case of being able to build capital, that's for sure, over the last two years. And where you
take comfort as well, we increased the dividend. We had $2 billion of capital returned last quarter, so our
intentions are clear to return capital where we can but also to be prudent in how we do so given the environment
and current regulatory uncertainty.

Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. One negative question, one positive question. So, on the negative side you talked about bending the cost
curve but I think second quarter year-over-year, it's bending the wrong way and six quarters from now you're
saying it should bend the other way. So, what are we not seeing in the financials that gives you such confidence
because it seems based on this quarter's results a little bit more of a trust me story.
And on the positive side, TTS has continued double-digit growth. You continue to invest more in that business.
How are you monetizing greater money emotion among your multinational and other clients? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Thanks, Mike. I'll kick it off and then send it back to Mark. In terms of the expense side, we've been very
transparent about the ark of our investment spend, related both to transformation and beyond. We'll continue to
give you that transparency, Mike. Note last year, we hit our expense guidance. This year, we're on track for the
guidance of roughly the $54 billion ex-FDIC and divestitures, and looking forward we continue to guide what are
the three levers that will drive the reduction in the expense curve starting at the end of 2024. It's from the exits
and I think you've got a clear sense around the progress that we have been making on the divestitures and
therefore we're pivoting as we talked about to focus now on really tackling those stranded expenses as we close
off the final couple of sales there in Asia in the next few months. We'll realize the benefits for our investments in
transformation and controls over the medium-term. We'll also have the benefit of the remediation work getting
done and expenses going away from that, and then the third one will be simplifying the organization as we talked
about.

So we'll continue to walk you step-by-step what are the different actions we're taking, what are we doing and
hopefully we're building up that track record of doing what we will say we are going to do every quarter.
Mark, anything to add?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
The only thing I would add on the expense side. I mean you may want to touch on the TTS but the only thing I'd
add on the expense side is the – we are taking repositioning charges, Mike. I mean we're not sitting still as we go
through this uncertain period of time where wallets across certain parts of the industry are under significant
pressure. And in taking those repositioning charges, they're going to be expense reductions that ultimately play
out over the next 12-month period. So, that's the other factor in addition to what Jane mentioned in the way of
exits and benefits from the transformation. That will play into the cost base over the next 12 months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
And then on TTS, I think we all share your enthusiasm for this business in terms of the growth potential that we've
been realizing and expect to continue, albeit converging now to the medium-term guidance over the next few
quarters where we see it's a high to medium single-digit growth going forward. It's a very high-returning business
and some of the indicators of how we're monetizing those relationships, we're seeing it both in terms of new client
wins. They were up 41% this quarter. We have a sustained win/loss ratio of 80% on the new deals across
different client segments.
We're also seeing growth that's starting to really kick in from our commercial bank and the expansion of clients in
the middle-market around the world as we grow out that franchise and we've got some very good fee growth,
which as Mark points out and I point out all the time, we're very focused around cross-border up 11% US dollar,
clearing up 6%, commercial card is up 15%, et cetera, and we continue to invest in the business as well so to
make sure that that 80% win ratio continues, so first bank to launch 24/7, 365 US dollar clearing. We've got the
instant payments platform we just launched for eCommerce clients. We have Payments Express that is now live
in the US, on track for five markets by the year-end. So, it's a story of innovation. It's a story of investment. Its got
great returns. It's a good growth story and it keeps on going.
And I don't want to diminish Securities Services in there either. It's another business that's similarly continuing to
see significant client wins, up 65% versus last year as well and a lot of our strategy there has been focused on
gaining share with the asset managers in North America. A couple of years ago, we're down at 2.6% share. We're
up about 4.3%. Our target is about 5.5% there in 2025 in that key growth area and there's a lot to like here too.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning or good afternoon. So I apologize having to ask the expense question again, but I think it's just
very important because there's really two potential long-only investment phases on Citi, right: One is the buyback
given your tangible book values at $85 and the stocks at $46. And the other is this bending the curve on
expenses.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2023
So, let me just ask Jim's question another way. In looking back to 2017 and I'm just looking at 2017 because I can
breakout legacy and core that way. And I'll fast forward to 2022, you produced revenues ex-Legacy Franchises
about $61 billion in 2017 and about $67 billion in 2022. The associated expenses, again without Legacy
Franchises, was about $34.5 billion in 2017 versus $43.5 billion in 2022, so you're surpassing the revenue uplift
during that period by $3 billion.
I guess the question is you have so much certainty about the timing of this expense and I'm wondering how much
of this $9 billion can go away? We understand there's a lot of opportunity for reinvestment in the core business
but I think all of us are struggling to really understand that magnitude. And I think that the investor base and the
market fully understands the Legacy Franchises story and how the exits will take time. But I think they're most
interested in the core business and how much of that can come out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. Look, no need to apologize for asking the question again. It's an important topic.
I would say a couple things. So, one, is that we can certainly look back in time but I would highlight that we're here
because we needed to have invested more in our franchise. And so, undoubtedly, there's going to be an increase
in our expense base that reflects the underinvestment from the past and in shoring up safety and soundness and
actually moving towards a more automated, operational, more modernized operations and infrastructure. So
there's certainly going to be that.
With that said, with those investments come efficiencies. So, with the move from manual to automation, over time,
those types of investments will yield benefits in our cost structure and that's part of what is going to bend the
curve over that medium-term period.
The other thing that I'd highlight is obviously with the Legacy Franchises, there's $7 billion of expense associated
with those and that will come down, but because of the Mexico transaction we're going to be stuck with that a little
bit longer given the IPO process. It doesn't put a big dent in our ability to bring stranded costs down, and by the
way it does come with top line revenues and historically has been accretive to our profitability and returns. And so
I highlight – I mean I'm not going to give you kind of new guidance on where our expenses will end up but what I
will point you to is not only the $54 billion this year, roughly $54 billion this year, not only the bending of the curve
in the third and fourth quarter or the third to the fourth quarter next year, but we've given guidance on top line
growth, revenue of 5%, call it, CAGR through that medium-term period and we've given you kind of operating
efficiency targets that we've set as well and we intend to deliver on those things that reflect the bending of that
curve through all of those drivers that we've mentioned.
So I hope that helps, Erika. I appreciate the focus on both capital and expenses. We are equally focused on it and
know just how important it is to achieving those targets. We're not only kind of doing the things that we've
highlighted in that strategy articulation but we're also being responsive to the current environment that we're in.
We think that aides in our ability to deliver the targets and the bending of the curve and we know there's an
additional opportunity that Jane has referenced, to the simplification of the organization as we make what I would
argue is considerable progress on the exits towards the end of this year, and all of those things will be important
to ensuring we get to that lower cost base which we will do.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Sorry and just to follow-up on that. I guess you guys have been pretty clear on the timing and you guys have been
pretty clear on why the curve will bend. I guess I'm wondering is it just a timing issue that you're not giving us the
sort of the dollar numbers that could go away from the transformation? Is it just a timing issue or are you still at a
point where you don't know how much of that you would need to reinvest to arrive at that 5% revenue CAGR?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Erika Najarian Q

And I'm wondering if you haven't told us what could come out of those expenses because it's just a timing issue,
it's July 14 versus 4Q 2024, or have you not yet made decisions in terms of how you may allocate those
expenses, in terms of do you need some of those expenses that could come out to grow your revenue base to
that 5% CAGR versus having it fall to the bottom line. Sorry. That's the question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Got it. Jane, you want to start or I....
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
No. Go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Okay. Yeah. So I'd say a couple things. So, one, Erika, is obviously with that revenue CAGR, will be volume-
related expenses that play out but we're also focused obviously on the non-volume-related expenses and not
giving you a precise number because the magnitude of that bend is a factor. So, obviously Mexico for example,
as I mentioned earlier impacts the magnitude of the bend and we're going to and have, in fact when you look at
our expense base even for the quarter, we've spent money in Mexico to drive that top line 22% revenue growth,
10% ex-FX. And so they're going to be nuances in the running of the business in a way that ensures we're
maximizing shareholder value that impacts the magnitude of the bending of that expense curve. Investments that
I got to continue to make in TTS in order to maintain that number one position and that competitive advantage
that we have. And so those things will impact that magnitude of the bend. We've been I think very transparent as
we get into each year giving you concrete numbers. What I'm telling you is the curve will bend. And as we get
closer to 2024, we'll give you more direction on the magnitude for that year and beyond.

Hey, Steven.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So wanted – hey. Wanted to ask a question on capital. Just given the recent increase in your SCB, I was hoping
to better understand why the 11.5% to 12% remains the appropriate long-term objective in your mind. And as we
prepare for Basel III Endgame, think through the capital benefit from future asset sales can you speak to whether
that will translate into operational risk capital release, specifically as it's less clear whether those benefits will
accrete even as those asset sales are consummated?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
I'll kick it off, Mark, and then pass it to you. So when we look – we're confident we're going to meet the 11% to
12% RoTCE target over the medium-term. The core drivers of how we get there remains unchanged. One, it's the
revenue, so expect to grow by 4% to 5% CAGR as we continue to execute on the strategy. On expenses, it's the
clear path to bend the curve by the end of 2024, bringing those expenses down over the medium-term; and third
and importantly it's continuing to optimize our balance sheet, including improving RWA and capital efficiency, and
as we referenced earlier in the prepared remarks different drivers in that that are helpful exiting 14 international
consumer markets, changing our business mix. And I'd also note that the transformation has benefits not only for
our efficiency but it will also support RWA and capital optimization.
That said, there's uncertainty around the future capital requirements in the industry and importantly the timing of
their implementation. We, like everyone, again have to work through those implications once we know what they
are. But – as we said, keep in mind we've got some other levers to pull over time. Capital allocation, DTA
allocation and utilization. Our GSIB score and our management buffer of 100 basis points. So that's where you
hear the confidence for us – from us around the path to executing and that remaining consistent.
But Mark why don't I hand over to you just around consumer market sales and operational, our RWA release.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. And again I think that if you look at the transactions that we've closed to-date, they've generated or freed up
about $4.6 billion of capital. The two that remain to be closed in the balance of the year will generate another $1.2
billion or so. That will be important to our capital base. I think that we obviously have to see the proposal as it
comes out, the NPR and we have to – we'll have a window to respond to that. We're hopeful that the regulators
hear our response and views on it as it comes out. There's clearly going to be reference to increases in RWA and
operational risk implications potentially as part of that.
I do think that exiting without having seen the proposal and without obviously knowing how those rules might
evolve, I do believe that the exiting of these 14 markets does play towards not only reducing our SCB and stress
scenarios or as it comes out of stress analysis and tests but also should play through helping to reduce risk-
weighted assets and potentially our operational risk as well but we have to see what the proposal looks like and
go through that. And I think what's important here is that whenever it comes out, whatever it looks like, as we
dissect it and go through it we'll figure out how to manage through it. Whether that be through exiting certain
products, seeking price adjustments as it relates to customers, clients and the markets, or continuing to optimize
RWA as we have been doing very proactively. We'll figure out how to manage.

Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
And I feel compelled to jump in here as well. Because as the spring and the recent test results showed the large
US banks are not only in a strong capital position but we've been able to play an important stabilizing role for the
system as a whole. It's a role that we take very seriously and we certainly hope that as the details of the capital
frameworks get unveiled, that this is fully taken into consideration, including the impact on US competitiveness
and we need a level playing field with Europe, not a gold-plated one, and we share the concern that higher capital
levels will undoubtedly increase the cost of capital for medium- and smaller-sized enterprises and consumers in
particular and will drive more activity to non-regulated and lesser capitalized players that isn't in the system's
interest. And we hope that that's fully taken into consideration here because we will take actions on businesses
and we will take pricing actions as will the entire industry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Really important point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. Thanks for that perspective, Jane. Very well said. Just one quick follow-up for me. PBWM fee income
trends, given the lower partner payments, I mean clearly the Wealth fee trends would suggest that they were quite
subdued in the quarter. I just wanted to understand your outlook over the near- to medium-term. What drove
some of the weakness this quarter? Is it something that you expect will likely persist, especially given some of the
market tailwinds that we've been seeing, would have expected to see a little bit more resiliency in Wealth fee
income in particular.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. Look, I think as we mentioned, Wealth was down about 5%. It's really hard to talk about the rebound in
Wealth in the midst of such an uncertain environment and the one that we're in, it's hard to disconnect those
macro factors like rates, inflation, the prospect of a recession from what we're seeing in Wealth and I think there
are two dynamics that have played out: One has been the shift from our customers – from customers more
broadly into higher-yielding products from out of deposits; and the other has been the fee revenue from an
investment management fee point of view. And as you might think about it, it is a higher rate environment. There
are opportunities for clients to earn more. And not until there's greater certainty in the broader macro factors will I
think we start to see some real momentum tick up there.
Now, with that said, and a couple of things worth reiterating which is we're seeing very strong referral momentum
from the Retail Banking business up through the Wealth continuum, if you will. So we've had about 25,000
referrals, May, year-to-date, from our retail branches into our broader Wealth business. That's a good thing.
We've seen the number of clients that we've onboarded tick up pretty meaningfully, both in the Private Bank and
more broadly across Wealth. That's a good thing. Those are things that position us well for when greater certainty
does play out and these clients start to put monies back to work in the broader investment platform and offering
that we have.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2023
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good afternoon. Just one quick question, Mark, for you. On the consumer cost book, you gave some
metrics. One, can you remind us what you reserved for in terms of unemployment rate, macro and whether if we
do see [indiscernible] (01:05:48) market, does that necessarily mean that we'll see a big ratcheting up of current
result where you already are? Just something around that would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sorry. Just the last part of your question. I'm sorry. If we do see what?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. So, one, like where are you in terms of your unemployment rate assumption and if the
unemployment outlook worsened, let's say, over the next six to 12 months, does that mean that you are already
reserved or will we see another big pick up in provisioning as a result of that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Got it. Thank you. Look, our current reserves, as you know as we think about CECL we've got three different set
of scenarios: We've got a base case, an upside, a downside. Our current reserves are based on the mix of those
three macroeconomic scenarios. It reflects about a 5.1% unemployment rate on a weighted bases over the eight
quarters and it's roughly flat to what it was last quarter. What that means is obviously our downside scenario has
unemployment that's much higher than that, closer to 7%. We'll call it 6.8% or so but that's kind of how we've
thought about unemployment.
As we think about the reserves each quarter, obviously we take a look at the macroeconomic factors and how
they're evolving. Our base case today assumes a mild recession and reserves in the future, we'll consider how
our weighting towards downside, upside and baseline may morph, subject to our outlook and volumes. Those are
the two factors that influence whether we're increasing reserves or not.
I would point out though that in addition to unemployment and because unemployment has been as stubborn as it
has been, if you will, we also look at debt service coverage ratio as an important factor as we think about our
consumers, as we think about their balance sheet, as we think about the risk that they may or may not be facing.
So, unemployment is an important factor but we've flexed our thinking in light of the environment and in light of
how behaviors have been shifting and that's an important factor in how we think about our reserves as well. I feel
very good about the level of our reserves. You heard us mention earlier, we've got $20 billion of reserves. We're
well-reserved across the portfolio but those are all-important elements to it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And just one very simplistic question. When you talk to some of your largest shareholders, those
who are optimistic who think you can hit your RoTCE target medium-term by 2025. Is that a realistic expectation
given -I appreciate Basel exchanges. You answered like 10 questions on expenses but should we expect the
groundwork through 2024 that we hit that medium-term target in 2025 or just your degree of confidence? That's it.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2023
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. Again, the thing I'd point out and Jane feel free to chime in here is that what we talked about was getting to
our medium-term returns, 11% to 12% and the medium term is 25% to 26%, so it's not just 25% just to be clear,
and we do continue to feel very confident around our ability to do that. You heard us mention the levers that we
think will contribute to that. Obviously, capital is important in how that evolves and we continue to kind of work to
optimize the balance sheet while serving our clients effectively and importantly growing the strong businesses that
we have that are high-returning as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And our next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Actually, a follow-up on credit here. You talked about continued normalization of credit card in the back-half of
the year. And just wondering you've got the normalized loss rates on slide 22. Are you still thinking you'll hit those
I think exiting this year or early next year? And I think at one point you said they might go a little bit above that
before they kind of come back to a normal level and is that still the case?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yes. Thanks for the question. The answer is yes. We still expect for both portfolios to hit those normal levels
some time at the end of the year. The normal levels as you point out are on the page for both Branded as well as
for Retail Services. We would expect, again subject to how and when this mild recession kind of plays out, we
would expect that they would tick higher than that before getting back inside of that range. But again all of this is
tied into how we've calculated our reserves, the delinquencies that we're seeing, the mix of the portfolio which
again skews towards your higher FICO scores and the customer behaviors that we're seeing which play through
not only that cost of credit line but also plays through the growth that we referenced earlier in the top line. But the
short answer is, yes, that's still our thinking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
And as Mark said, I think we feel good about our positioning as a prime but also a strong credit proposition that
we have. We're seeing stronger demand for the credit-led products such as value cards [indiscernible] (01:11:13)
and installment loans as well as the service-led engagement for the more prime customers. And so that's also
going to be a valuable factor driving growth and profitability as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then on the follow-up and this is not really Citi-specific but for the card industry. There are a lot of the banks
that are in card. Everyone is talking about kind of getting these normalized levels, just, call it, in the near-term
here or next couple quarters. And I guess just thoughts on getting this normalized level of losses when
unemployment is all-time low, wages are growing, obviously there's inflationary pressures. But it's just a little
surprising again, not Citi-specific, but it's a little surprising that we're getting to this normalized state when things
feel like they're pretty good.

Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. I think -well, also, normalized state back in 2019 was also pretty good, so you're not hearing any alarm
bells ringing from Mark or myself at all here on the US consumer. I think we see the US consumer as resilient.
We've talked about them being cautious but they're not recessionary and we are seeing more pressure on the
lower FICOs. We don't have a large number of that in our portfolio but that is where we're seeing more of the
normalization happening on the payment rates for example, and other behaviors in there. So, it's quite localized
but I don't think we should be overly concerned here about the health of the US consumer. And as Mark said,
we're in a very unusual environment; higher inflation, so these rate levels and a strong labor market. And under
those conditions, it's the debt service ratio as he said that is – we think is a more useful leading indicator that we
keep a close eye on.

Mark, can you share with us, in your financial supplement, obviously you gave us good details on you credit
pictures and we're talking about credit right now, and the non-accrual loans have been flat as a pancake for the
last 12-months for you folks and the industry as well, and this is in light of the Fed funds rates, as we all know
have been up over 500 basis points. Can you guys share with us what's – why we haven't seen more – and this is
mostly corporate of course but everybody's been hanging in there very well in view of the fact that rates have
gone up so much. What are your customers telling you or are you seeing that has enabled them to remain very
healthy in light of a 500-basis point increase in interest rates?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2023
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. I think I'd point to a couple things, Gerard. One is remember we focus on the large multinational, largely
investment-grade quality names and so that's one important factor when you think about our ICG and Corporate
exposure there.
The second thing I'd point out is we have to remember that many of these companies had and still have very
strong balance sheets and that they've managed that through the COVID and pandemic situation and that has
positioned them well.
I think the third thing is that and you've heard us mention how we are proactively managing the prospect of a
recession. And I think when I talk to other CFOs, I know that when Jane talks to other CEO's, they too are looking
at their expense line, they too are looking at the efficiency of their organizations and opportunity to increase that
efficiency in light of a potential slowdown or a recessionary environment. And then the final point is I think a lot of
firms have been – that were proactive in the low rate environment in shoring up that balance sheet strength.
Now with that said, you've heard us also mention the prospect of a rebound in capital market activity, that has to
happen at some point. But sticking to your point around credit, I really think it's those factors that you see play
through in not only our very low NAL but also our very low credit losses, credit costs that you've seen in our
business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And then as a follow up, when you think about what we've seen with the Fed's tightening over the last 12 months,
banks like your own have positioned the balance sheet accordingly. And I know the BancAnalysts Association of
Boston, Michael did a good job of explaining how you guys manage the balance sheet. And how – when you look
at it going forward, do you think changes are coming because the Fed, if they end the Fed funds rate increases,
we get to a terminal rate, how are you guys positioning the balance sheet do you think going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Look, we're constantly actively managing the balance sheet in light of not only our client needs but also how we
see the broader macro environment evolving and changing. And as you know and I know you've seen and we've
talked about before, we shared in our Qs, our view or our estimate for interest rate exposure and what happens
with the 100 basis point swing in rates in one direction or another across the curve, across currencies. You've
seen that shift over the last number of quarters to the last quarter where that estimate for IRE was about $1.7
billion or so but heavily skewed towards non-US dollar rates and currencies. And I think as we think about the
view on how rates will evolve, you'll see a continued shift there.
I think that when we look to print this quarter, that number will probably come down a bit in terms of interest rate
exposure and skew even more towards non-US dollar currencies in light of where rates are in those markets, and
the US dollar will likely be somewhat neutral in light of what that curve currently looks like. But again something
we actively manage, first with an eye towards what client demand and needs are likely to be for use of our
liquidity, but also with the view for how the macro environment might evolve and what we're hearing from central
banks around the world.

Operator: And our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. I'm sorry, we have Mike Mayo with
Wells Fargo.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. I meant to follow-up earlier on the bending of the cost curve. If you were to put different initiatives in terms of
how far along you are, maybe like your exits might be in the 8th inning and your transformation might be in the 6th
inning and your remediation in the 5th inning, and the simplification in the 1st inning or 2nd inning. Are those
numbers correct? How would you put those numbers in terms of bending the cost curve, where are you further
along and where are you just getting started?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Well, Mike, I love you but I'm not going to play that game. What I will say is that we clearly have work that we're
doing as it relates to the exits but we're making very good progress on that. Not just on the closing of the exits but
also on putting a dent in the stranded costs associated with those exits that we have closed. And so as Jane
mentioned in her prepared remarks, by the time we get to the end of the year, ex-Mexico, we would have made a
considerable amount of progress on there and that creates an opportunity to do more around the simplification of
the organization and so that simplification is obviously in an earlier inning, call it, the exits in a later inning.
I think that the transformation spend, investments and those things, look, we are squarely into execution as you've
heard us mention before and as I have mentioned, the expense base around that is going to continue to morph
from spend that we've made around third-party consultants that helped into crafting of the plan towards
technology, towards people that are critically involved in the execution of it, and then a downward trajectory
towards the benefits we get from that technology in reduced operational expense. And so it's a multi-year journey.
We've talked about that.
We've got a number of years to continue to execute against it. But what's important is we know what we have to
do, both in how we're investing that money and as it relates to being disciplined about our cost structure and
bending the curve and again that's what we're going to do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And one more attempt. Can you remind us how many people are working on the transformation remediation and
how much that's costing you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. I mean again we've got – I think the number I shared was somewhere around 13,000 people or so that are
broadly working on the efforts here. We haven't gotten into specific costs. It's in the total number. But what I would
say again is that we're clear on what we've got to deliver and execute against and we're managing that cost very
tightly. We're constantly looking at opportunities to deliver on those transformation deliverables more efficiently,
leveraging more technology, leveraging AI in some instances. And so we're not just taking those execution plans
as they were crafted and delivering against them but we're looking for efficiencies and even the execution plans
as they are constructed today and that's important for us to keep doing.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. I know this is going long here. Just quick one. Just, Mark, on – I just want to get your sense on the sentiment
around client activity in both the markets group and what the pipelines are looking like in Investment Banking and
the feel for that? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Look, I'll jump in here. Corporates are pretty cautious. They've got another Fed hike in the offing, tensions in
China and the West, OPEC and oil, a general sense of more limited growth. But I think clients have been trying to
understand and get their arms around both the macro and the market outlook for a while.
I think they now seem to accept the current environment is the new normal and are beginning to position
themselves globally. So, globally, we're seeing less anxiety around funding as most large corps are biting the
bullet and paying higher rates to take advantage of issuance windows, balance sheets getting reinforced. We
certainly don't see a large cap credit crisis on the horizon. And on the IB side, it remains – the pipeline is robust.
There's a lot of pent-up demand for M&A but it's hard to predict when that pipeline will unlock. ECM had tangible
momentum over Q1 and we're also seeing sponsor [indiscernible] (01:23:08) showing signs of improvement but
both of those are from a very, very low base.
And on the investor side, most of the investors stayed on the sidelines in Q2. The debt ceiling was a bigger topic
than economic news was and then it was a very low volume environment. We saw a bit of pickup at the beginning
with the light bump in volatility the last few days, but I wouldn't call that a trend yet.

Charles W. Peabody Q
Analyst, Portales Partners LLC (Connecticut)
Yes. Good afternoon. I have a question about your Markets related net interest income. And before I ask the
question, I do appreciate that you run those businesses on a holistic basis and that NII is probably more of a
residual outcome but a couple of questions related to Markets related to NII.
First is you had a pretty nice jump up in the second quarter versus the first quarter and I just wanted to
understand, is that largely related to seasonal dividend issues?
And then secondly, you have a positive NII outcome where a lot of your money center brethren will have a
negative NII outcome for markets and I'm just wondering what the difference is? Is it the outsized FICC business
relative to equities or is it international or is it how you hedge, what's the difference on that? So those are the two
questions.

Thanks for the question and thanks for the acknowledgment that we do manage our Markets revenues in total so I
appreciate that.
What I would say in terms of the Markets NII is you've captured it right which is the dynamic that's playing out
between first quarter and second quarter is, in fact, dividend season. And again given the globality of our
franchise, the dividend is not just a dividend in any one region but dividend in multiple regions playing out over the
course of the first and second quarter.
I can't speak to the peers at this particular stage, but what I would say is that you know that our book skews, more
so than peers, to Corporates and that's important and we obviously have a very, very strong FICC business, more
broadly as well. So dividend season, a major driver here in that increase.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles W. Peabody Q
Analyst, Portales Partners LLC (Connecticut)
Okay. And just as a follow-up. Is there any sort of directional guidance you can give on Markets related to NII. I
mean does it – I mean to the extent second quarter was bolstered by dividends, it comes down in the third quarter
but then does it go back up in the fourth quarter, so would the second-half be kind of equivalent to the first-half?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Charles, I really appreciate the attempt there but I'm not going to give any further guidance on the breakout of the
NII. I will reiterate the ex-Markets NII increase by the way to plus $46 billion but thanks for the question. I
appreciate that.

Operator: And our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Hey, Vivek.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks. Couple of questions. Number one, so capital. Jane and Mark, going back to that, should we expect
that given what you have mentioned, given everything going on in the regulatory environment that the ratio you're
at currently it should grow in anticipation of what may come or likely to come with all the regulatory stuff or are you
going to try and keep that closer to the 13.3%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
I think we're going to see exactly what the framework is that comes out on that and then the implementation
timeframe for it and then look at making adjustments to the plan, also hoping that the comment period is taken
seriously and the different considerations I talked about earlier are taken into effect. Then, we'll work through what
are adjustments we make; pricing, capital reallocations, et cetera, the playbook that you would expect, the same
one that we've done with [indiscernible] (01:27:40), and we've done with a number of other pieces, and we would
also hope to see our SCB in a different place for the same reasons we talked about earlier Vivek because there's

a lot of volatility in that SCB, dependent on the scenario that comes out every year. And I would say given the
shifts we're making in the business model, we'd expect to see that one come down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
The only thing I'd add is again the CET1 ratio of the 13.3%, as of October 1 would be a 12.3% reg-required level,
and 100 basis points of the management buffer, so that would be what we'd be held to as of October 1.
As Jane mentioned, the NPR as it comes out, we'll take a look at that and see if there are implications on the
CET1 stack but more likely implications on the risk-weighted assets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
And what's really important there, aside from the very important points Jane made in terms of it considering
broader factors, is the timing of the implementation of whatever that final rule includes. And obviously the more
timing for implementation, the more of an ability it gets for the industry to think about how to absorb the
implications there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Right. But I'm presuming you'd want to go sooner rather than later because the markets going to expect that
rather than take a full three years or whatever the Fed might give you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. You know what? I'm really interested at this point in seeing proposal and then we'll have a chance to kind
of really react as an industry and as a firm.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Completely unrelated if I may. Non-interest-bearing deposits, what are you seeing given you're very heavily
corporate-driven. When I look at your point-to-point because you don't give a full average balance sheet, it's only
interest-bearing related but the non-interest-bearing is only available on a period-end. When I look at that, there
was a big drop in the US this quarter. Anything unusual? Is that accelerating? What are you seeing amongst your
clients, are people still waking up and what have you factored into your NII guidance for that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Well, again, I think the point I'd make here is that we continue to see clients shift from kind of non-interest-bearing
deposits and into both interest-bearing and CDs and other higher-yielding products in light of the rate environment
that we're in and I would expect us to continue to see those types of shifts, subject to how rates continue to
evolve. And again on the Corporate side, we've seen, in the US clients, have reached kind of those terminal – that

terminal level, terminal betas I should say outside of the US rate hikes I think are still in the future as Jane alluded
to, and the terminal betas have not quite yet been reached. But in terms of the non-interest-bearing, we are
seeing that dynamic play out.
