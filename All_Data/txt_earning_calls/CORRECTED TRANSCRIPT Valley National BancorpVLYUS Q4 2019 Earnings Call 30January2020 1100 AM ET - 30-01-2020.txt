Thank you, Rick. Good morning and welcome. Our fourth quarter results are a reflection of the tremendous
progress we've achieved over the past couple of years. We continue to make significant strides towards delivering
on and repeating our previously stated goals of consistent growth, improved operating efficiency, and greater
diversification of revenue.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, Valley reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.24. Our adjusted EPS was up
14% from the fourth quarter of last year. Furthermore, our full year 2019 adjusted EPS of $0.92 was also up 14%
versus the full year of 2018. Keep in mind, we delivered these results in a challenging macroeconomic
environment, which has put pressure on net interest margins for the entire industry.
Equally impressive, we delivered 12.7% tangible book value growth for the full year, while announcing and closing
a significant acquisition. Additionally, this growth occurred while paying a meaningful cash dividend and
reinvesting in our products, people and infrastructure. Two years ago, we identified several key targets and
guidelines for you to hold us accountable. As you have observed, substantial progress has been made on each
and every one of those guidelines and targets. Our loan growth has consistently been above industry average,
while maintaining the same prudent underwriting standards, which have long been a hallmark of Valley.
We have driven down our core cost, beating our estimated adjusted efficiency ratio goes for the full year of 2019.
Our multiyear branch transformation initiative has resulted in consolidations and cost saves, while delivering a
better product to our customers, which can be seen in many underlying deposit trends. And just as important that
is customer experience scores throughout our branch network have exponentially expanded as well. Our fee
income continues to grow, boosted by improvement of existing businesses and expansion of new products.
Lastly, shareholder value creation is a top priority, and we delivered an exceptional deal with Oritani, which was
immediately accretive to tangible book value and all of our capital ratios. Additionally, we remain very encouraged
with the many trends we witnessed during the fourth quarter such as strong organic loan growth with significant
geographic and product diversification, excellent business and retail core deposit growth, continued improvement
in efficiency, and very sound credit metrics.
I'm extremely proud of the progress we have made over the past two years and believe this is only the beginning
of a long run of success for Valley.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn for some additional financial highlights for the quarter.

Thank you, Ira. Turning to slide 5 in quarterly net interest income and margin trends. Our net interest margin
increased 5 basis points to 2.96% from the prior quarter while the interest rate spread increased 10 basis points

tailwind we believe exists in our current liability structure. We had previously outlined this opportunity in our
forward repricing gap during the third quarter call.
Accordingly, we have been focused on managing liability costs lower while maintaining competitively in the
market. Furthering our efforts to lower the cost of funds was the extinguishment of approximately $635 million of
longer term FHLB debt during the fourth quarter. We had originally cited the intention to extinguish this debt in
conjunction with the closing of the Oritani transaction. This action resulted in an approximate $23 million after-tax
charge and is expected to result in approximately 200 basis points of annual interest expense savings on a
comparable level of borrowings, a significant portion of which we have captured in recent weeks.
While we continue to place emphasis on the short end of the curve on liabilities, we did take the opportunity to
extend duration modestly during the fourth quarter by moving approximately $300 million out between two- and
three-year durations utilizing alternative wholesale funds. We believe this action is prudent given the absolute rate
available and current shape of the curve.
As you can see from the 12-month forward maturity schedule on slide 6 of our EPS presentation, there are still
substantial ability to reprice both retail CDs and other wholesale borrowings meaningfully lower should the current
rate outlook remain.
As illustrated on slide 9, we continue to see the effects of lower repricing on our monthly deposit rate averages.
As such, we believe we are defensively positioned for the current rate environment and outlook.
Moving to assets. As expected, the current environment continues to negatively impact portfolio yields. That said,
we sold approximately $800 million of mostly New York City-based multifamily loans that had a weighted average
yield of approximately 3.53%, which helped offset some of the core yield compression.
At year-end, approximately 57% of our loans were adjustable rate while 37% of total loans are scheduled to reset
within the next 12 months. Approximately, 15% of total loans are indexed to one month LIBOR and another 9%
are tied to prime which repriced either daily or monthly.
Additionally, almost 19% of loans priced off of varying CMT indices, the bulk of which contractually reprice every
five years. As seen on the left chart on slide 8, lower index rates over the past six plus months, continued to place
downward pressure on new loan origination yields. While much of this is driven by market pressures, we did
witness a 17 basis point rebound in new origination spreads during the quarter.
This is important and a product of our ability to access lower cost deposits to fund significant growth. Another
noteworthy observation is the pace of lower new origination yields has begun to slow in recent months. And while
it's too early to call a bottom, stabilization is an encouraging signal.
Moving on, our non-interest income declined 7% linked quarter driven primarily by lower swap fees of $3.9 million.
As we discussed during the third quarter earnings call, we expected that this business to soften in the fourth
quarter. Moving forward, we expect this could continue to be negatively impacted in the first quarter by what is
historically a seasonally slower period for loan growth.
As a percentage of adjusted operating revenue, adjusted fee income was 13.8% which is a decline from the prior
quarter 16% level. While this quarter's outcome was modestly below our long-term goals of 15% to 20% of total
operating revenue, the quarterly annualized increase in net interest income compounded the declining fee ratio
which is a good issue to have.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
Diving into the results in more detail, we generated swap volume of approximately $10 million during the fourth
quarter of 2019 originated back-to-back swaps on approximately $400 million of notional loans.
Our net residential mortgage gain on sale income increased 13.5% from the third quarter of 2019. These gains
were the result of approximately $300 million in loan sales during the quarter, which consisted of both conforming
flow and one jumbo bulk transaction. Our conforming gain on sale margins improved approximately 21 basis
points from the previous quarter.
In the future, we believe more active marketing efforts and education among our sales team and clients will
continue to make non-interest income a larger contributor to the bottom line. Our reported expenses increased
approximately $50 million from the prior quarter. The reported numbers includes several infrequent items totaling
approximately $51 million on a pre-tax basis. Specifically, the loss on extinguishment of FHLB debt was
approximately $32 million and merger-related expenses were $15.1 million. The amortization of tax credit
investments was $4 million for the fourth quarter.
Our adjusted expenses exclusive of tax credit amortization and previously mentioned infrequent items were $145
million, up approximately $5 million from the previous quarter. Importantly, this does include one full month of
direct Oritani expenses which were approximately $2 million. Approximately $1.3 million of this can be seen in the
quarterly salary lines with the balance being dispersed across several line items.
We also incurred approximately $350,000 in quarterly expense aimed at resolution of Oritani's preexisting
regulatory issues. It's worth pointing out that the direct Oritani expenses we realized in December would equate to
achieving over 38% cost saves on an annual basis, well ahead of our expected timeline. Keep in mind these
saves have occurred before a system and back office integration and without consolidating or closing a single
branch.
Further support of our commitment to efficiencies can be seen within the salary and employee benefits expense.
After adjusting for merger-related severance costs and backing out direct Oritani-related expenses from
December, we saw a decline of approximately $1.6 million from third quarter 2019. This fourth quarter adjusted
level equates to a quarterly year-over-year decline of 6.4% as compared to 4Q 2018.
As we have spoken about many times in the past, we are hyper-focused on creating greater operating leverage.
Nowhere is that more obvious than looking at our adjusted efficiency ratio.
For the fourth quarter, we reported $52.4 million over 100 – 52.4%, sorry, over a 100 basis point decline versus
the previous quarter. While full year 2019 declined an impressive 412 basis points from 2018 ending at 53.78%.
This was well below our full year target of 55%. Making this even more impressive is that this occurred while
entering new markets, expanding products, and announcing and closing a significant acquisition.
It has become ingrained in our management culture to focus on reallocating resources towards business lines,
products, and people that give us the greatest returns on our expense base and the results speak for themselves.
Our loan growth adjusted for the acquisition of Oritani for the fourth quarter was an annualized negative 0.9%.
Importantly, this metric includes the sale of approximately $800 million and multifamily commercial real estate
loans mostly within New York City which occurred late in the fourth quarter. Absent the sale and the Oritani
acquisition, loan growth would have been 10% annualized. Our full year 2019 organic loan growth excluding

Oritani and the sale of multifamily loans would have been approximately 9% or just over the high end of our
guidance.
As illustrated on slide 8, much of this quarter's organic growth came in commercial real estate, C&I and
construction. The average size CRE loan originated during the quarter remains relatively small at $2.1 million
while average C&I was just $376,000 further diversifying our risk.
From a geographic perspective, our growth was well distributed; approximately 40% of our total quarterly
commercial growth came from Florida and Alabama, while New York and New Jersey made up approximately
55% with the balance coming in our national commercial businesses.
We sold approximately $300 million in residential loans during the quarter, approximately 44% of which came in
the form of a jumbo portfolio bulk sale in which we retained servicing. Conforming loans sold increased 19.6%
from the previous quarter which generated the balance of gains via sales through our standard GSE outlet.
Deposit trends were very favorable for the quarter. At quarter end, loan-to-deposit ratio was 101.8%, well within
our desired range. Our total deposits ex-Oritani increased approximately 4% linked quarter and 8.6% for the full
year. Excluding Oritani, non-interest bearing deposits grew 10.5% annualized on a linked quarter basis while our
core branch deposits grew 6.4% for the full year. We witnessed annualized linked quarter growth in savings now
and money market accounts of 6.1% also exclusive of the merger.
Momentum in our branch and online deposit channels continues showing net new account growth of 3.3%
annualized on a linked quarter basis. Perhaps, more important, balances associated with these channels grew at
a linked quarter annualized pace of over 13.5%.
Diving deeper, we have seen tremendous balance sheet growth – balanced growth in our checking accounts at
11.3% on an annualized linked quarter basis. Our efforts in online banking while still relatively immature saw net
account growth of 9.3% from the previous quarter while all of our geographies experienced net account expansion
as well.
We are proud of these achievements especially considering we closed 15 branches during the calendar year that
carried combined balances of approximately $485 million. This is further evidence that our branch transformation
efforts led to more proactive customer outreach combined with enhanced product offerings are having a positive
impact on both retention and growth.
As illustrated in the average deposit balance and rate trends chart on slide 9, we have been managing deposit
rates lower across both business and retail segments. As shown, the monthly average rates for savings, NOW
and money market accounts have declined for five of the past six months, while CDs have experienced a similar
trend.
As we stated last quarter, we expected greater repricing benefits to come in 4Q 2019 given the anticipated lag
effects. Notably, the months of November and December experienced accelerated declines in average rate. We
continue to expect more declines during the first quarter of 2020 given the forward repricing dynamic and liability
sensitive pricing gap we face over the short-term.
During the quarter, we saw reliance on short-term borrowings diminished by approximately $732 million. This was
facilitated by a combination of pay downs offsetting the aforementioned loan sales, accessing brokerage CDs and

our successful core deposit raising efforts during the quarter. As we mentioned earlier, we extinguished
approximately $635 million of long-term FHLB debt during the quarter that we had previously identified.
If you recall, this debt carried a weighted average cost of around 3.93% compared to current market rates that are
greater than 20 basis points less – that are greater than 200 basis points less. In the fourth quarter, we added
$300 million of modest duration broker deposits at favorable long-term funding rates taking advantage of the
shape and absolute level of the curve. While we continue to place emphasis on pulling liability costs lower, this is
a prudent approach towards laddering our funding sources and managing our relatively neutral interest rate
position.
I want to give a brief update on asset quality, capital and the expected impacts of CECL. Our total non-performing
assets declined approximately $6.3 million from the previous quarter, our accruing past due loans saw a more
meaningful drop from the previous quarter declining over $20 million. As we signaled in the previous quarter, this
decline was expected given the administrative circumstances that resulted in the previous quarter's increase.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded a $5.4 million provision for loan losses. Our net charge-offs
increased by 3.6% from the previous quarter, driven primarily by medallion loans for which reserves had
previously have been established and one smaller C&I credit.
Turning to CECL. We are lowering our estimated range of impact that we spoke about last quarter. After running
additional parallel tests and updating the expectations of the forecasted economic conditions and portfolio
balances as of December 31, 2019, we estimate that CECL could result in an increase to our non-PCI allowance
of approximately $30 million to $40 million as compared to our current reserve levels. This is down from the
previously expected range of $50 million to $70 million. This addition would be exclusive of the balance sheet
transfer that occurs within the PCI-related portion that existed at year end. The PCI-related reclassification will not
have any impact on the pro forma capital or regulatory phase in period.
In terms of capital, you'll notice the significant improvement in both tangible common equity and regulatory capital
ratios during the quarter. These increases were accomplished by a combination of the acquisition of acquired
Oritani capital and significant progress made towards lowering the risk weights associated with much of the
acquired portfolio.
Further the decline in risk weights was the – furthering the decline in risk weights was the sale of approximately
$800 million in multifamily loans. The robust levels of capital generated by the acquisition and other internal
efforts are another example of management's commitment to building a balance sheet that can support values
expansion for years to come.
I'd like to give a brief update on the increase in reserves associated with uncertain tax liability related to
renewable energy tax credit and other tax benefits previously recognized from the investments in the DC Solar
funds plus interest. As you may recall, we had previously established a partial reserve in the first quarter of 2019.
After recent developments, we recorded an additional $18.7 million increase in our tax reserve. And as a result,
are fully reserved for the tax position related to DC Solar at December 31, 2019.
Finally moving to slide 11 of our presentation to cover some targets and outlook. We are establishing new, full-
year 2020 loan growth guidance in the range of 6% to 8% after residential loan sales. This growth assumes a
base of approximately $29.7 billion of our period end 2019 loan balance.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
Our outlook for net interest income is being established in a range of 13% to16% growth for the year. This is the
expected percentage growth off of our full-year 2019 base of approximately $898 million. Keep in mind, this
percentage growth is elevated due to the timing of the Oritani acquisition and the expected full-year realized net
interest income from the acquired portfolio in addition to organic growth.
On a standalone Valley, the expected growth would be approximately 3% to 6%. Our net interest income outlook
assumes a 25-basis-point rate cut in 2020. In terms of net interest margin cadence, it would be reasonable to
assume some modest pressures in the first quarter of 2020 driven in part by seasonal decline due to day count
combined with continued pressures on new origination asset yields and one full quarter impact of Oritani. We are
maintaining our previous adjusted efficiency ratio target of 51% or lower being achieved at a period during the
year. Finally, we're establishing a full-year tax rate range of 24% to 26%.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Ira for some additional commentary.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Valley National Bancorp
Thanks, Mike. I'd like to provide a brief update on the Oritani merger. After receiving regulatory approval and
record time for Valley, we were very pleased to close the transaction in early December. We look forward to the
many benefits this transaction will provide including new customers, deeper penetration into valuable affluent
market, and additional capital to fuel future growth. We are planning integration later in the first quarter and should
begin to deliver on additional cost saves shortly thereafter.
I am extremely happy with the progress made to-date and want to thank all Valley and former Oritani employees
that made this deal so special and successful.
In closing, 2019 was an important year for Valley. Many of the themes that we've laid out to you for the past two
years are progressing, and the financial results and momentum are illustrative of these efforts.
We had been able to deliver on significant goals we laid out which include sustainable balance sheet growth that
is underwritten with our consistent and conservative approach; greater efficiency, positive operating leverage
driven by a cultural shift within the entire organization; thirdly, strategic balance sheet management with a focus
on building capital and allocating it more effectively; and lastly, a disciplined acquisition strategy aimed at creating
shareholder value in the short and long term. All of this has occurred while making significant reinvestment in our
infrastructure to support a reinvigorated Valley for years to come.
The bank's transformation continues, and I remain absolutely confident and energized by the progress made so
far. I believe these changes would have a positive impact on shareholder returns over the long term while
reinforcing our commitment to community, employees and innovation.
With that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I guess maybe just starting off, in terms of the loan sale this quarter, I just want to make sure I got all the pieces
here. Specifically the question is what was the gain that you made on that sale? And the reason I ask is because
if you look at sort of – we know that the loans were yielding around 3.4%. You're saving 3.9% so that's maybe 50
basis points per year, about $3 million of savings, but it costs you $32 million to get out of this debt. So there must
be some very large gain to make this economically make sense for you, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, Ken. It's Tom Iadanza. I can't comment on the terms of the loan sale. All I will tell you is that we believe it
was prudent to exit or lower our exposure in the New York City multifamily portfolio. There were no credit issues
within this portfolio of loans. We saw it actually was performing fairly well with a 63% loan-to-value and a 1.7
times debt service coverage similar to the loans we have. They don't – they didn't fit into our relationship banking,
return and deposit strategy that we have within the bank. They're capital-intensive with lower relative yield with
minimal cross-sell and deposit opportunity. And we'll always assess our capital leads and our asset businesses to
make sure that they all fit or will seek better opportunities.
So, again, I just want to stress there were no cap – there were no credit issues with it. It was a sound portfolio. It
was an opportunity to get out of lower-yielding assets in a class that we thought it was prudent to reduce.

Yeah.

Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Valley National Bancorp
I think, in our mind, they're really two separate transactions. The FHLB transaction that we described when it
came to prepaying the debt was consistent with what we disclosed when we were announcing the Oritani
transaction. So, basically, what we did is we took a little bit of the excess capital that was generated through the
Oritani deal. Use that to pay down debt that took a prepayment charge. So, we still had a positive capital position
that resulted from Oritani. And this created positive EPS as we began to move forward. So, the loan sale really
was a distinct decision differentiated from the gain or differentiated from what we did on the borrowings. So I
really wouldn't look at them as connected at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got – even though you used a fair chunk of the proceeds from the sale to fund the FHLB repayment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Valley National Bancorp
We were looking at them from an independent perspective, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Valley National Bancorp
So when we announced the Oritani transaction, we announced the $635 million. So the saves that was going to
come from that was largely a function of just reinvesting or re-borrowing back in different term debt at a lower
rate. It so happened that we were able to, as Tom identified, enter into this unique transaction that they coincided
in the same quarter. That said, they really were an independent transaction. And in our mind, once again, the
FHLB transaction that we did on the borrowings was largely connected with what we we're doing from the Oritani
deal and really utilizing some of that excess capital.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got you. Okay. So, assuming there is no gain, which is my assumption or we can make that assumption, this
could have been net negative from you guys in day one, but you're just saying you want to do it because
strategically it makes you a better bank going forward even if you've lost money on this transaction.

Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Valley National Bancorp
...I don't think over the long-term, we lost money on the transaction. I think when you look at – and make whole
payments when it comes to any FHLB transaction, you pretty much come up neutral. I mean, it's all really a time
value of money what your forecasted saves are versus what your one-time prepayment [indiscernible] (00:28:54)
is.
I think for us, as we looked at it, what was the additional capital that we acquired through the Oritani transaction,
how much of that additional capital we needed versus where we wanted to be on an EPS perspective on a
prospective basis? It was really just the balance of those two. Once again, separately, we entered into a unique
transaction that provided us an opportunity, as Tom mentioned, to reduce some of our exposure to the New York
City marketplace. And we were able to really move forward with that.
In addition to reducing some of that exposure, I think as Tom alluded to, those were really transactions that didn't
provide us opportunity to cross-sell from a relationship perspective. So, we think it's a much more efficient use of
capital on a go-forward basis.

...with regard to many transactions. So, we might give you a number of $14 million broken out over a four-year
period. So you can back into a number for what the one month would have look like, and it's really an immaterial
number. For us, I think as we try to look at forward earnings, we try to make them as sustainable as possible and
not have a lot of purchase accounting adjustments within.

Operator: Our next question comes from Frank Schiraldi with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Hey. Good morning, guys. Just on the loan growth assumptions for 2020, just wondering what that 6% to 8%
might include in terms of runoff of the multifamily portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, Frank. It's Tom again. I think the multifamily portfolio – the New York piece is now stands at about $1.4
billion, pretty strong loan to value [ph] are in that (00:31:16) kind of [ph] 50 to 60 (00:31:16) range depending on
the Oritani versus a legacy Valley portfolio. The Valley portfolio is all customer relationship-driven, so we're not
anticipating significant runoff. We'll selectively participate and do new business there. Keep in mind, this was not a
major part of our business in the past. The yields were always low. We only did these loans to people we knew
well, long-time customers that were really [indiscernible] (00:31:43) relationship driven. So, there could be an
expectation that we will see some repayment through the normal course of business, maybe a little bit extra. But I
think with what we've built in other aspects of our business, we'll make up for that.
Keep in mind, Mike mentioned the granular nature of the portfolio at $2.4 million of average CRE loan, $375
million on a C&I side of a new production. We'll – that's our focus. Our focus is to be well-diversified without any
reliance on any significant asset class. So, we're going to continue that approach and we expect to meet the 6%
to 8% guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
I'm sorry. How much, Tom, do you say is New York multifamily with the Oritani book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
$1.4 billion. $600 million is legacy Valley, about 800- a little over $800 million is Oritani. And again, the loan-to-
value on the Valley piece is around 60%, on the Oritani piece is 48%. All has performed and we expect that to
continue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Valley National Bancorp
I think if you look at 2019 as a guide, we originated about $6.2 billion in total loans across the entire footprint and
in each of the individual products. I think for us, as we continue to move forward, there's absolutely not a focus on
expanding the multifamily portfolio. So, balances are expected to really remain pretty much flat. So, I think as we
commented on where we saw growth this year, within the Florida and Alabama footprint, to a larger degree than
maybe some of the other areas, as well as within that C&I products that is probably going to continue for next
year for us.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay. Just as a follow-up then. The sale in the quarter, if you could maybe just talk through why that bucket was a
bit different in terms of [ph] because you (00:33:37) sound like credit quality was still fine there. What made –
given the pickup in capital from Oritani and then you mentioned CECL also is a smaller relative mark, why you
decided to sell this bucket as opposed to let it runoff over time or get replaced over time? So, what was different
between this and the rest of the portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. This bucket was a transaction oriented bucket of loans. There was no deposit associated with it. Our loan-
to-deposit ratio was quite high in this piece. The balance of our portfolio is relationship driven. It's the people that
we have long-term relationships that use us for many products and services. So, again, it was really assessing
our capital allocation, getting out of lower yielding non-relationship businesses and focusing our attention on the
return and relationship-driven businesses. It's return against volume.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay. And then, I'm sorry, you might have said, but this was not part of Oritani's portfolio, this multifamily sold?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
It was not part of Oritani portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q

Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
Hi. Good morning. This is Alex Lau on for Steve. So, post your – the closing of Oritani, can you give an update on
branch consolidations and also an update on underperforming branches? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. Alex, it's Tom Iadanza again. We have identified and announced that there are nine branches all in less
than a mile from each other that will be closed as part of the acquisition. That's what we're announcing and that's
where we are today.
With regards to the Valley branches and our branch transformation, we had a previous calls announced we would
be reducing the Valley footprint by 10 branches during 2020, we're still on target for that. I think on the positive
side, the retention of deposits in the closed branches has been very high and it's really the – based on us getting
out in front of the customers getting to them early and making sure that we have a lot of contact and retain a high
percentage of those deposits. And if I recall, they're in an 85% retention or so range.
We'll continue to manage it that way. We do manage our branches individually, that just to make sure that we
have the right mix of deposits, the right mix of people, the right service levels. Our focus on our branches today
are really service and sale-oriented, and it's important to us. We did complete the renovation and the new model
look of our first date branches. And I'm speaking as a proud father on this, they came out extremely well, and it's
been well-received by our customer base. So, we're on track and on the way with our branch transformation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Lau Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for that. And just a follow-up on your loan-to-deposit ratio. With Oritani, what is the – can you remind me
the range that you're comfortable with and would that be below 100%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So, as we've said in the past, the same range on the top still exists. So, we're looking for something in the
neighborhood of 95% to 105%. So, it's the same as it was before.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Our next question comes from David Chiaverini with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. A couple questions for you. So, starting off, looking on slide 8 where it shows the loan yield portfolio
and the origination yield. So, the origination yields were 4.1%. The overall portfolio is 4.51%. I was curious, and I
heard your comment about how the NIM in the first quarter should be under some modest pressure. But I'm
curious if we think longer term given the roughly 40-basis-point spread between what you're originating loans at
and what the overall portfolio yield is at, should we expect additional pressure kind of through 2020?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So, absent the comments we made about the first quarter, which I think you have right, keep in mind that
our spread, as I said in my prepared remarks, was up 17 basis points. And so, I think we're seeing some slowing
in the rate of decline here. As I said, it's not [indiscernible] (00:38:26) called bottom yet on it. But it's certainly
encouraging maybe that those two lines in the bottom left quadrant of the slide would start to narrow somewhat.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then on the other side of the equation, now that you prepaid the expensive
FHLB debt and that some of your costs of deposits are coming down, do you happen to have what the kind of
blended spot rate cost of deposits or cost of funds, I should say, total cost of funds at December 31 was? That
way, it can give us an indication as to what to expect into the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
We're going to look. David, I don't think we have that handy, but I can certainly reach out to you afterwards with
that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then last one related to that is and I like this slide where you're showing the cumulative cash flow gap
and you show that the maturing CD rates are in the 2.2% range. What are you guys renewing CDs at currently?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
So, I'll answer that in two parts. First, one of the things that management tracks very well here is the retention of
those CDs as well. And so, those have ranged from roughly 80% to 90%. For new rollover retained CDs, we're in
the range of 1.5% to 1.7%. So, very significant reduction in our funding costs on this large portfolio which you can
see, we have about $1.7 billion first quarter, another $2 billion coming up in the second quarter, and then another
$1 billion in the third quarter. So, it is a significant mover of our potential net interest margin as we talked about in
the third quarter as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks very much.

Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just to continue on with the NIM question, so I just want to make sure I
understood you all correctly. You are assuming a Fed cut in this guidance, is that correct?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then just trying to understand, it seems like if we look at your NII guidance for the year and then some
of the moving parts obviously to get there, it just seems like the NIM should trend in a much better way than what
the NII guidance would imply. So, if there is opportunity to beat on the upside, I mean where do you think you
have a better opportunity, on the funding side, on the asset side? Because I just – it just seems like if, and I
haven't run through all the numbers, but it seems like you're setting up for NII growth to be higher than what
you're offering in a targeted range. I want to try to figure out what I might be missing here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
So, I would put it into two buckets, which I think you actually said. First would be our funding costs. The reason
that we could not maybe achieve the net interest margin numbers that you might otherwise think are a function of
whether or not the curve stays where it is today, whether we have a Fed rate cut or not, the absolute shape of the
curve, and then how much we get. So, as I've said in the third quarter, we're going to reprice down on the CD and
wholesale funding books. The question is how much we're going to fund down. And we're going to ladder into
that. We're not going to try to reach some bottom and then pick the right time to do that.
The second part would be on the earning asset side of the loan book. And to the extent that we would have loan
growth higher than what we're guiding to, clearly, we would have an increase in net interest margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Valley National Bancorp
I think, Collyn, when you look at it, I think you obviously highlighted the two key points there. But I think when you
look at it, we have an unbelievable amount of deposits, as well as other types of funding that's going to reprice
based on where the cost is today versus where we're seeing overall market rates.
And then, on the asset side, obviously there's a significant amount of assets that are tied to short-term indexes.
So, if there was a rate move, right off the bat, there's an immediate negative reaction to our NIM. That said, over
the longer period of time, it is absolutely accretive to us as we continue to move forward. Hope that helps.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And then, Mike, just to clarify. Your comment was that one quarter NIM would be down. Is that what
you're insinuating...

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Valley National Bancorp
I think we're flat from where we were in the 4Q. I think your point is, right, a few years ago, we used to show a
little bit of all in the fourth quarter based on the activity in the different types of instruments we were in. So, I think
we're running around $4 million a quarter now, and that's probably a good run rate for us as we continue to move
forward into 2020.

David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Thanks for taking the follow-up. So, I wanted to touch on expenses. So, previously, you've given in absolute dollar
kind of expense range for the next quarter, possibly two quarters. I was wondering if you had any thoughts as to
what a normalized kind of expense run rate looking out to the first quarter would be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
This is Mike. So, obviously, we're not going to give guidance on a expense increase year-over-year. You can kind
of back end to it given our efficiency ratio. But I will say this, that we demonstrated operating leverage in 2019.
We want to continue that operating leverage and given the guidance that we laid out, I'm pretty sure when you put
that into your model, you're going to see that operating leverage continue. And just...

Okay. Thanks for that. And then question on other income. Is – it was higher than expected the past couple
quarters at $19 million in the third quarter, $17 million in the fourth quarter. Just curious what to kind of expect in
this line item going forward. I think you mentioned earlier that there might be a little bit of some seasonal
weakness in the first quarter, but is low-teen kind of a good run rate there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I want to make sure I direct you to the right slide here. Here we go. So, if you take a look at slide 5, you can
see the components of that. And the largest portion is the bottom which is that kind of dark blue, which is the
swap income. And as we said in the third quarter, we feel that the sheer level of swaps that were done was
elevated came down a little bit in the fourth quarter like we said. So, I just think that in order for this to move
meaningfully, it's probably going to come out of that category. And it's been averaging about $13 million to $15
million a quarter.
