Thank you, Aarti. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I'm pleased with the strong performance we
demonstrated throughout 2019, including the fourth quarter. We ended the year with very good momentum,
positioning us well for 2020.
Over the past year, we showed profitable balance sheet growth, including growth in key markets. We've delivered
significant earnings contribution from our countercyclical businesses, improved efficiency and deployed capital
effectively. We spent much of 2018 integrating Capital Bank into our legacy business. In 2019, we successfully
leveraged the combined platform with an expanded market presence and increased balance sheet capacity.
We were able to deliver good earnings power and delivered merger synergies. Our announced transactions with
the IBERIABANK MOE and the Truist branch acquisitions should further enhance our growth prospects. We
should also deliver nice earnings accretion in 2020. Our strategic focus paid off with broad-based loan and
deposit growth in key markets.
Our higher return specialty areas were especially strong. Our diversified loan portfolio was up 7% from 2018 to
2019 and credit quality trends remained stable. We were able to favorably shift our funding mix with customer
deposits replacing wholesale funding with a regional bank average deposit growth of 9%.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
Our countercyclical business mix helps us to produce solid returns even in a challenging interest rate environment
such as 2019. Our fixed income business benefited from falling interest rates and market volatility. Fixed income
revenue was up 52% from 2018 to 2019, and average daily revenue was over $1 million in the fourth quarter of
2019.
Our mortgage warehouse lending business was also helped by lower rates and customer expansion and showing
133% growth year-over-year. The momentum we accomplished through balance sheet growth, expanded market
presence and countercyclical businesses result in the achievement of the financial targets we laid out for 2019 in
our 2018 Investor Day.
We now have a strong foundation to build on this momentum, and we'll use our experience with the Capital Bank
merger to successfully execute on our MOE with IBERIABANK. We will also have meaningful opportunities with
the acquisition of the 30 branches in very attractive markets that will provide additional earnings accretion.
Throughout the next year, we'll remain focused on growing our balance sheet and not getting distracted while we
close and integrate these transactions. I am pleased with our integration planning to-date and am more confident
today about our ability to deliver the announced synergies and build a leading regional franchise.
The current economic environment is relatively steady in our view. Our markets are still showing solid growth. Our
customers broadly remain relatively optimistic with the economic outlook.
I'll now turn the call over to BJ to go through the quarter. Then I'll be back with some closing comments. BJ?

William C. Losch III
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Great. Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. I'll start on slide 7 by reviewing our EPS trends, we saw
quarter-by-quarter through the course of 2019, which gives a good perspective of how the momentum of the
business has accelerated over the last year. Our key financial objectives this year were primarily twofold. First, to
accelerate the strong loan and deposit growth momentum that we were seeing towards the end of 2018 post the
Capital Bank integration. And, number two, leverage the full year impact of merger cost savings and continued
expense efficiency efforts.
Coming into 2019, we, like others, expected rising rate environment, yet that outlook quickly shifted at the
beginning of the year and put significant pressure on our net interest income growth. However, our business
model and our teams adapted as we expected. First, we did an excellent job of growing loan and deposits with
total average loans up 7% and total average deposits up 5% year-over-year.
Second, we maintained strong loan and deposit pricing discipline. In particular, our ability to continue growing
core deposits while lowering our deposit rates paid from 103 basis points in 1Q 2019 to 82 basis points in 4Q
2019 helped mitigate the impact of three Fed cuts. Third, our countercyclical businesses like fixed income and
loans to mortgage companies generated strong earnings growth that more than offset the rate headwinds.
And lastly, we took out almost 7% of our gross expense base through actions designed to both improve our
efficiency and allow for needed reinvestment. Through all this, we posted quarterly earnings growth over the year
on an adjusted basis that continued to strengthen throughout the year culminating in full year adjusted EPS
growth of 18% versus 2018.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
As you can see on slide 8, our consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter showed the line item drivers of
growth both linked quarter and year-over-year. Few highlights I would point out, average loans from fourth quarter
2019 versus fourth quarter 2018 were up 13% year-over-year. Despite the challenging rate environment with the
multiple Fed rate cuts, we still grew NII 3% year-over-year due to strong commercial loan growth and managing
deposit costs lower.
Fees were up materially both linked quarter and year-over-year from both continued increases in bank fees from
strong customer growth and excellent performance from the fixed income business. You'll see on the bottom right
notable items are related to the merger costs from the pending IBERIA deal, a charitable contribution that we
made to our foundation, and our previously announced rebranding launch that occurred in the fourth quarter.
Let's take a deeper look at the broad-based loan growth we're seeing on slide 9. And as you can see here, the
13% growth in loans, which is well ahead of industry growth, comes from all parts of our franchise in both our
specialty businesses, which grew 31% and 8%, excluding loans to mortgage companies which had an
outstanding year. And across our markets, we saw healthy growth with particular strength in our highest
opportunity markets like middle Tennessee, south Florida, and Texas. Encouragingly, pipelines into 1Q also
remained strong, and we expect the favorable momentum to continue.
Taking a look at deposit trends on slide 10, you see that our core deposit gathering in the regional bank is strong.
And as with our loan growth, our growth in deposits is also broad-based across both our specialty businesses and
our markets. And again, we've done this while being very disciplined on pricing. Deposit rates paid declined 13
basis points linked-quarter and are down 21 basis points since the first quarter of 2019.
Turning to slide 11, this brings us to the fixed income business which, again, as Bryan said, had an outstanding
year. We've known that this business had the nimbleness and capability to quickly capture revenue opportunities
when the market turns, and with the decline in interest rates and the market volatility it was favorably impacted in
terms of market activity in our sales and trading across all of our desks.
And in addition, our other product revenue increased with customers continuing to execute rate swaps, resulting
in higher fees in our derivatives business. And during the last few years, the management team has repositioned
the expense base for improved profit leverage as volume returned, which is clearly evident in the results we've
seen this year. Given the general level and direction of rates along with some expectation of continued market
volatility, we expect the fixed income business to continuing delivering solid results into 2020.
Let's turn to net interest income and margin on slide 12. Linked-quarter, we saw increases in both NII and NIM as
strong loan and deposit growth coupled with deposit costs discipline and a rebound in accretion led to a 3%
linked-quarter increase in NII and a 5-basis-point expansion in the net interest margin.
In the bottom left, we wanted to dimension for you how much of a headwind the change in the interest rate
environment was, yet how well our teams were able to manage through it through strong customer growth and
solid pricing discipline.
Now let's turn to expenses on slide 13. Underlying the great growth and revenue performance we saw across our
markets and businesses, we also continue to actively reposition our expense base for improved efficiency. The
discipline approach to expense management we've had over the last several years was a major contributor to our
earnings power over the last year as well. And on an adjusted basis, we were able to reduce expenses slightly
versus 2018 despite a $40 million increase in fixed income expenses that supported its higher revenue. We did it
by both lowering our core expenses through the achievement of cost saves from the Capital Bank deal and
5

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
continuing with further efficiency actions such as branch closures, decreases in vendor and discretionary
spending. The $80 million of expense reductions we reference here equates to about 7% of the gross expense
base.
By continuing our efficiency efforts, we were able to make some reinvestment in our customer experience and
technology initiatives that will be critical to our future success. And by driving significant positive operating
leverage, we were able to bring down our efficiency ratio substantially about 600 basis points from 2018 to 2019
on an adjusted basis to finish fourth quarter at 59.9%. We believe expense management is the strength of our
company, and this track record gives us confidence in our ability to gain the expected further scale and efficiency
benefits from the IBERIA merger.
Turning to asset quality on slide 14, our credit trends remained excellent throughout the year as we maintained
our underwriting discipline. Net charge-offs in the quarter were at only $3 million with delinquencies and
nonperforming loans declining both linked-quarter and year-over-year as well with provision growth largely due to
the strong loan growth. Again, credit quality remains strong and we expect our credit trends to remain stable.
Slide 15 gives you a preview of our expected CECL impact which, as you are aware, we will adopt in first quarter
of 2020. We currently estimate that the adoption of CECL will result in an allowance to loans ratio of 100 basis
points to 110 basis points. We'll experience an increase in the reserve largely due to longer term consumer loans
and establishing a reserve for previously marked and acquired loans. Other commercial portfolio reserves are
expected to remain relatively stable. As a reminder, we'll also see an impact on the reserves when we close our
IBERIA transaction, and we have repeated these and laid them out at the bottom half of the slide.
On slide 16, you see a brief update of our IBERIA merger and branch acquisition. Activities for both the closing
and integration planning remains on track. In addition to holding town halls and engaging employees, we have
already completed several steps in the regulatory application process and commenced integration planning. Our
current expectation is to close and integrate the branch transaction in the second quarter of 2020 and to close the
IBERIA merger sometime mid-2020.
Wrapping up on slide 17, again, 2019 was a transformative year for us. Our successful execution of the Capital
Bank deal strengthened our franchise, improved our efficiency, and favorably shifted our funding mix through
market and customer expansion. We delivered on our financial targets in 2019 that we had laid out at our Investor
Day. We showed meaningful earnings growth despite a challenging rate environment. We showed strong
business momentum by generating earnings and balance sheet growth and demonstrating the benefits of our
complementary business model. Our merger of equals with IBERIABANK and the Truist branch acquisition will
expand our opportunities in attractive high growth markets, enhance our scale and lead us toward top tier
profitability. We're not done. Momentum continues across our business into 2020.
That's all I have. Bryan?

Thanks, BJ. To repeat BJ a little bit, we've accomplished a great deal over the past year. We delivered on our
financial targets that we set out in that Investor Day. We grew our earnings despite the challenging rate
environment and successfully executed on the opportunities from the Capital Bank merger. We ended the year
with strong momentum and we see that momentum continuing into 2020 as we work on the integration of our
MOE with IBERIABANK and our branch acquisition from Truist.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I wanted to start on the margin, maybe for BJ. How are you thinking about the core NIM here, like near term as
well as, as we work through 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, I think what I would say into 2020, Steve, is we would expect net interest margin trends to remain
relatively stable through the next couple quarters. There usually is a seasonal decline in the first quarter related to
seasonality of loans to mortgage companies which is one of our higher yielding businesses, day counts and that
type of thing.
So there could be – could be a dip because of those factors in the first quarter. But generally speaking, given the
pricing discipline that we've got on the deposit side and the loan side we would try to hold that relatively stable
over the next couple quarters.

Okay. That's helpful. And then I appreciate the CECL disclosure. As we think through the day two impact and we
look at the 1% to 1.1% range, should we assume that you stay in the middle of that range, or is the bias a decline
over time as items such as non-strategic runoff, for example?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I think – as you know, the CECL impacts really are largely [ph] unknown. (00:18:54) There's a significant
effect of future views of the economy as we get into the use of CECL. And so if we're assuming that the future
economic environment is relatively the same as how we view it today, then I would expect that the 100 to 110
basis points largely stays.
Our non-strategic portfolio now is well under $1 billion and so not nearly as big of an impact as it used to be. So if
we continue to have a commercially oriented balance sheet which we expect, then I think largely that range will
likely hold.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And does the potential capital hit from CECL change your thoughts around buybacks at all?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Not necessarily. Now, of course, we can't do any share repurchases with the pending IBERIA merger, right? So,
nothing would be occurring till that closes, but not really. I think you're moving from one pocket to another in terms
of capital in my opinion, so all of that we'll be putting to our stress test which again is the foundation for how we
think about deploying excess capital. And with that, we feel very strong.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then finally, I'm curious, if you guys look at the synergies post the IBERIA deal closing, the benefit from
the SunTrust branches, do you guys feel consensus properly captures the earnings power of this new company?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Probably the short answer is no. I think the momentum that we've got in our business is going to carry on into
2020. Bryan talked about it at the beginning as being a major focus of not losing sight of continuing to run the
business as we integrate. So that's one of our top priorities.
Then if you look at how we're performing today, how we've taken costs out of our own organization, how we've
done it in the Capital Bank deal, how much expertise IBERIA has integrating and doing the same types of things,
we feel very confident in our ability to put these two companies together well and deliver that profitability profile
over time that we expect from the deal.

Steve, this is Bryan. To add to what BJ said, we don't think about how we influence consensus in the short run.
Our role is to deliver on the commitments that we make and we're very optimistic about what we see in both of
these transactions. And as I said in my opening comments, the more planning that we do, the more optimistic I
am that we will not only deliver, but potentially overdeliver on those commitments. So we see both of these
transactions accreting to earnings and we see both of them delivering significant shareholder value over time.
We recognize that it's our responsibility to manage the business day to day and to execute on what we've said
we're going to do, and that's what we're set out to do.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
In your opening comments, you guys said that expense management continues to be a strength of the company.
You took out another $80 million, 7%, last year, in 2019, that's above and beyond any sort of deal related cost
savings. How do you think about that going forward? Do you think there's still opportunity to reduce the legacy
expense base from here or are you to the point where reductions are not going to be as notable?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Brady, this is Bryan. I'll start it. I think it's going to be really, really difficult in the next year or two to separate out
what's associated with our integration or the merger – or merger of equals with IBERIA. But we continue to
believe that, through this period and beyond, that we will continually have to rethink our expense base and think
about how we manage expenses too, as BJ said, control costs, but also invest in the technology and
infrastructure to deliver the products and services that our customers are looking for.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
The short answer to your question is, yes, I think there are other additional opportunities in the legacy expense
base as well as on the IBERIABANK side that will allow us to deliver our merger synergies and will allow us to
fund the investments that we need to make long term. So I am optimistic that we will be able to do exactly what
you describe.
And as BJ said, if you go back 10, 12 years, we have consistently worked on our expense base. We have
consistently delivered greater efficiency. And it showed up on our overhead efficiency ratio improvement in 2019.
And I expect that you'll continue to see that improve throughout the merger and integration of the two transactions
that we've talked about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's helpful. And then the mortgage warehouse was also very strong in 2019. It was up – average
balances were up 75% year-over-year. And you finished on a high note at $4.4 billion in a seasonally soft quarter.
How do you think the mortgage warehouse will trend as we continue through 2020? And I know you all talk about
the yield being one of your highest – or one of your higher loan yields. Does that yield still run about 5.5%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
So, Brady, this is Bryan again. I'll start. Mortgage warehouse is a seasonal business. The first quarter is
historically the lowest, and I would expect that that could be down $400 million to $500 million on average versus
the fourth quarter. But as you look at it vis-à-vis a year ago, I expect it to be up. We've gained market share and
we continue to grow our customer base, and we continue to broaden the breadth and scope of the business.
So, while it will have seasonal fluctuations or seasonality, as we've said in the past, we believe it's extraordinarily
valuable business. It creates a tremendous amount of shareholder value by delivering very strong returns. And so
we live with the seasonal volatility, our outlook overall for the business is good. We expect long-term rates to be
low. We expect purchase activity to continue to be very good in 2020. Refi is a little less than half of the business
we're seeing today. So, overall, we're optimistic about the outlook for mortgage warehouse in 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
A few specifics I would add to what Bryan said. If you look at where we are just the first 10 days of January
compared to the January average last year for mortgage warehouse, we're more than double where we were last
year for January. So the pickup in the number of clients, we've added 17 net new clients year-over-year, and
we're looking – continuing to do business with good-sized companies, medium- and large-sized mortgage
companies and we've been able to increase our average mortgage warehouse relationship from about $22 million
to $30 million over the course of the last 12 months.
So, in addition to the economy leading to that great work by the team on bringing in new customers and
continuing to deepen relationships with customers, that will really help sustain that business even through some
seasonal and cyclical fluctuations.

Good morning, Ebrahim.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Just one, wanted to follow up on the margin. BJ, how should we think about the accretion at least through the first
half before you close either of the deals relative to the 15 basis points in the fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So we put on here on slide 12 just a dimension for you, the total loan accretion in the year was $42 million.
That continues to step down every quarter, right? So, accretion by nature would be lower in 2020 than it was for
2019. The other factor that's going to drive it even lower is the impact of CECL which takes away some, not all of
the accretion that you have from purchased or acquired loans. So, loan accretion will continue to come down over
the next few quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. Okay. So a step-down from the 15 bps in the fourth quarter, I guess.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, because we were – if you think about it, we should have been averaging something like 10-ish
a quarter. Third quarter was abnormally low. Fourth quarter was abnormally high. Put the two together and it was
right around the $10 million. But it'll continue to come down a couple of million dollars a quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And just going back to the IBERIA deal and – is it safe to assume that – I know you said mid-2020,
but that deal could close by the second quarter or by the end of the 2Q 2020 given just the timelines we've seen
with other deals like TCF last year?
And, Bryan, would love to get a little more color around just your confidence around the expense savings. As you
said, IBERIA has done a fantastic job in terms of getting expense savings from its deals historically, and you guys
have done a great job on expense management. If you could just talk to in terms of the possibility that expense
savings from the deal could run ahead of schedule and how you think just how the integration plan. Like, do we
see a good amount of savings come through by the end of the year or by the first half of next year? Would love to
hear any color that you can provide on this.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Sure. So the first part of your question was timeline. And we have no reason to believe at this point that we
won't get the requisite shareholder and regulatory approvals by second quarter of this year. So we expect to close
late first half of this year. So as far as we know, everything there is on track. And as BJ mentioned, we have made
the required filings and so the ball is rolling in that regard.
To your point, clearly the experience base with the IBERIA team has been very, very strong. They've done a
number of mergers and integrations over the years. And so when I step back and think about their experience
base and couple with ours, I think, fundamentally, we have the right focus on how we execute on these
transactions.
The thing that has really encouraged me has been the way the eight executives that we announced in the merger
announcement as well as the – our ability to roll that out further in their organization, the way these teams are
coming together and planning for this integration is very, very good in my view, and I've seen a lot of these over
the years. And there is a strong focus on not only how we deliver on these commitments but how we build the
franchise to be in a very strong and stable place for the future delivering strong shareholder value and products
and services that our customers won't need for the long term.
So, without trying to fine tune where expenses will fall throughout the back half of this year, I would say that I am
optimistic that we're going to hit our synergy numbers and I think over time we may prove that there is some
upside to that. So, I'm optimistic in the way the planning has gone to date. I love the way that the team is working
together to plan the combined organization. And as we get through this approval process and shareholder vote,

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
Hey. Just following up on one of the earlier questions about Street estimates perhaps not reflecting the earnings
power of the combined company. Obviously, there's a lot of moving pieces this year with the branch purchase and
IBERIA acquisition. Just curious why you guys chose to not provide 2020 guidance even on a standalone basis
given the momentum coming out of 2019.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I think generally speaking, as you know we don't provide guidance. We did – I guess you can call our
Investor Day targets a form of guidance. That I think was a little bit unique. I think if you listen to what Bryan and I
have said in some of our opening comments, you can take some trends away. Strong business momentum, loan
pipelines remain strong. We maintained pretty good discipline on deposit pricing. We talked earlier in the Q&A on
what we thought around margin.
Fixed income, given continued market volatility and the level and direction of rates, we feel good about the level of
what we're seeing there, and our expense discipline will remain a key focus for us through the first half of the
year.
Now, again, as Bryan said and everybody knows, it's going to get a little noisier as we get to close with the
IBERIA deal, and things are going to start to come together. But the fundamental business momentum that we're
seeing continues into the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, BJ. And just thinking about loan growth for 2020, I think Bryan mentioned perhaps roughly a $500
million step-down in mortgage warehouse balances. But just trying to triangulate what that can mean for 2020
growth. Last year, for 2019, you had the 3% to 6% growth expectations. Obviously, you came in ahead of that.
But is that a good range that we should think about on a standalone basis for 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think – clearly, we had really, really strong loans to mortgage company growth. It'd be
great if that continue, but we'll assume that that's going to come back in a little bit. But the fundamentals of the
rest of the growth feel really good such that low- to mid-single digit range feels appropriate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for that. And then, just one more for me on expenses. Backing up the onetime expenses, it looks
like the employee compensation expense was up, call it, $10 million or so quarter-over-quarter on a core basis
even with the FTN expenses up only $2 million or so. Can you just give us any color on what drove that step-up in
employee comp? Did you guys hire, was that incentives kind of catch up for the year or just any color you can
share on that increase? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
It's a variety of things. It was fixed income, variable comp driving much of it, but then year-end bonus accruals
given the strong year that we had, as well both on the frontline side related to the volume-based incentives, as
well as overall corporate results.

D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
BJ, you may correct me if I am wrong, but it – Tyler referenced the step-up in FTN expenses. Last quarter was
high because of the legal settlement that was reflected in those numbers and that didn't recur and compensation
expense was higher as a result this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A

Yeah. That's a good point.

Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yes. Thanks for that. I think I was taking that into account, but regardless. Yeah, that was – the FTN was
definitely a driver of that step-up. So, I can appreciate that. Okay. Thanks, guys. That's it for me.

Hi, Jennifer.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Question on asset quality, you indicated you think things will be relatively stable this year. Your
net charge-offs were so low in 2019? Just wondering how you kind of think about it going forward?
And, also your franchise lending, I know it's a small business for you but just wondering how that's performing
these days given restaurant pressure? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Jennifer, our outlook for asset quality has remained stable and strong at this point based on what we're
seeing in our portfolio, and I know Bryan touched on that on the client sentiment as well. We continue to be
14


First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
(FHN) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
selective and disciplined in terms of both increases to existing clients and bringing on new clients and disciplined
around servicing.
Just as a sidebar, I would add that I think client selection throughout for a long term sustainable portfolio is so
critical and our bankers really do a great job with that. I think that's a tribute to the model we've had in market
presidents and local credit officers in the market who know those markets and the people that we're doing
business with. Because if you do have a situation where you need to come to the table, it's always great to see
clients who step up and do the right thing and that's something that we talk about day in and day out.
So, I feel very good about the asset quality that we're seeing and the way in which we brought business on the
books. The franchise finance team is no different in terms of discipline around underwriting client selection. The
way that they follow various concepts and look for both opportunities and threats, that portfolio is performing well
but that is an area and I would tell you even though customer sentiment across the board is very strong. The one
thing we're hearing both from franchise finance clients and really others is the pressure on wages and quality of
labor.
So, we do talk a lot with customers about that and you also have many states went to a higher minimum wage
that was expected. And so these clients have put that in their run rate, but it is something that we watch closely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Great. Thank you. Another question, just, Bryan, wondering how you're thinking about retention of key IBERIA
revenue producers, one of IBERIA's competitors reported yesterday and seemed very excited about a potential
merger disruption. Can you just talk about what your strategy is there? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, absolutely. Look, when you're in merger, it's even more of a focus, but the reality of our business is, is that
our people are very important to us all the time and so we spend a lot of time thinking about how we really create
a culture where people want to be here and serve their customers. And we're working really, really hard with the
team at IBERIA to think about how we bring together these two organizations.
And it really starts with a fundamental similar culture as the way we do business, as the way we view credit, as
the way we fundamentally think about how we serve our customers and communities. And so, I don't expect very
much of any change on most of our bankers in terms of the way we do business. We've also been able to say
very clearly to our frontline bankers that, given the limited branch overlap that we have that we're going to have a
role for the folks that are facing our customers in the organization.
So, we don't think we're going to create very much disruption. But we're also thinking about how we use all the
tools that are available to us to ensure that people are committed to the organization, they're committed to serving
their customers and committed to growing the business. So I understand people might express optimism or
whatever they may express, but we're clearly going to work very, very hard to keep all of our bankers engaged in
serving customers and communities, keeping up the great momentum with full knowledge. When we put these
businesses together, they're going to be in a better place and better product set and services to serve customers
and do a better job for their communities.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
I wanted to touch on the liquidity profile post-close, once you guys do close these deals, they obviously bring a lot
of liquidity. The network deposits were up this quarter around $4.4 billion. What's a reasonable level for those
network deposits this time next year given all the liquidity? Because that could be a potential NIM defense lever
for you guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Casey, it's BJ. That's a good point. Particularly, the Truist branch acquisition gives us probably a net – little
over net $2 billion of very low cost incremental funding that we can then build a profitable loan and deposit
business on and some attractive market. So the thought process on the corporate finance case for those branch
acquisitions is bringing on net $2 billion of deposits at 50 basis points and letting go the market index deposits
and then, over time, reshaping further the funding mix. And so, yes, that is clearly a benefit that we expect to gain
in the second half of the year immediately and then leverage it further.
What we'll do is – I can't really give you an idea necessarily yet of what we think market index deposits levels will
be going forward simply because we want to put the two companies together and see where we need net funding
with. Those types of deposits, clearly a gap filler, if you will, much like how we use it today for excess growth in
loans to mortgage companies or movements in our fixed income trading inventory. And so the key point, though,
is that the branch acquisition will certainly improve our funding mix and we'll continue to optimize it with the
IBERIA merger as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And just switching to the NIM outlook, it sounds like it's stable, the core NIM is stable near term even with
mortgage warehouse sort of going against you this quarter. You guys did a decent job on the core deposit side
pricing this quarter. Is there still some room to push that lower and offset some of the mortgage warehouse?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I think so. There's a lag effect, as you well know, when rates – when the Fed cuts rates, LIBOR comes
down pretty much immediately, it actually leads into a cut, whereas deposit pricing takes a little bit of time to flow
through. And so the margin compression that we saw in the third quarter reflected that dynamic with pressure on
16

(FHN) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
loan yields which continued into the fourth quarter. But we started to see the benefit of the pricing changes we
made on the deposit side coming through in the fourth quarter.
Those deposit rate changes will continue more into the first quarter where we believe the pressure on loan yields
will moderate a bit. So, all in all, I think your theory is correct that that will help loans to mortgage company
balances and yields coming down will be a headwind. But, all in all, I see our margin being relatively stable a
couple basis points here and there to either side of where we ended the fourth quarter based on what I can see
today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Thanks. And just last one on capital markets, it sounds like the momentum is continuing in the first quarter
here. I was wondering if you can just give us a flavor as to where ADRs are trending year-to-date?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, I think through the first 16, 17 days of the year, I think we're between $950,000 and $975,000 a day.
We had $1.1 million in the fourth quarter which was great, and so we expect something around the range of
between those levels to be where we're at in the first quarter.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thank you. I just wanted to probe more on Tyler's question on expenses. BJ, I had been thinking more in
the range of $275 million to $280 million or so in terms of core expenses. I know there's a lot of moving parts
here, but is that too optimistic? Should we really be around closer to $290 million going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
I think it's probably not the $290 million range, it's probably lower than that, but probably higher than the $275
million range given how well fixed income has been growing. So I would say in the $280 million, $285 million
range would probably be more appropriate going into the first half of this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Excellent. And also the biggest overhang I think right now on expenses is around systems and the
integration. In terms of – is it Jack Henry? Is it your internal system? Is it a third-party? Can you clear the air at all
on that topic? And if not, when do you think you'll have a decision made that you can share with investors?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, Brock, this is Bryan. I can clear it a little bit. It's either going to be Jack Henry or our internal system, Hogan,
et cetera. I think that decision is...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
...relatively close. We're doing some evaluation and some work to evaluate the various angles, and I expect that
decision will be made in the next 30 days or thereabout. But it's going to be one of those two sets of systems.
We're not going to go reinvent the wheel or do something completely different. So we're going to keep the
organization moving, and I think that would be a decision that would be solved fairly quickly here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And you think you're already kind of bracketed with respect to that decision and expense dynamics of that
decision or do you think that could result in new guide around expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
I don't think that decision will have any adverse impact on what we've laid out in terms of expense guidance. And
potentially there may be some value down the road as we think about how all of the systems lies together, but we
think we put together something in our forecasting or our estimates when we announce the deal that took into
account that we're going to have to make that decision and we think we put something in place that was very
achievable in terms of an estimate. So I don't expect any adverse impact or expense estimates as a result of that.

Jared Shaw Q

Yeah. Just I guess looking at the Truist deal, is that creating any opportunities yet for you in terms of being able to
go on the offensive and maybe hiring employees or seeing any opportunities with customers that otherwise were
tied up, or is it still too early for you to say?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Jared, this is Bryan. It's probably a little too early to know the full impact but clearly in the 60 to 90 days that we –
since we've announced that, it had a very positive impact particularly in the Mid-Atlantic markets where we
already have a presence and there's a tremendous amount of excitement and it does create. It basically allows us
to do in the Mid-Atlantic market, call it the triangle and the triad area of North Carolina in particular.
We're doing 20, 25 years of work in terms of building branch share and branch franchise. So that has a positive
impact, and we think it will be positive for us in the long-term. We're excited about the other markets that we get
an opportunity to acquire in that branch transaction. And so, I think longer term, it will be a very positive thing for
us. And I'm optimistic that you'll start to see that momentum building as we close it sometime in the second
quarter and the early mid part of 2020 second quarter.

Jared Shaw Q

Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on the average daily revenue in the capital markets business, is that $1

current structure or is that sort of the solid wheelhouse right now given the outlook?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2020
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I think like I said a couple of minutes ago, I think $900,000 where we're at today is near term what we think
the business should be at over the next quarter or two. It's harder to look beyond that. But if you look on whatever
slide we had, slide 11, for fixed income, the bottom right gives you at least a bit of a dimension for how to think
about it and how average daily revenues flow in the business, right.
So, direction of rates coming down has been helpful. Market volatility has been helpful. But the state of the
economy continues to be fairly healthy. If you think back to when we had really, really big quarters in fixed income
like 2009, 2010, there was a very negative view on the economy and direction of rates and market volatility were
favorable to the business as well. So all of that to say is I don't think that this is a ceiling.
Now, we don't necessarily want the state of the economy to be what it would be to drive average daily revenues
higher. But we like the countercyclical benefit of having fixed income stronger if there are pressures on the
margin, which is exactly what we saw in 2019. So business is still performing very strong like I said in my opening
comments. The management team out there has done an incredible job over the last couple of years
repositioning the expense base such that when revenue and volume and activity did come back our profit margins
got better.
So as an example, three or four years ago, the leverage, if you will, for every $10 or so that we would generate in
incremental revenue, we would have $6 or so of expense. Today, if you look at the results in the graph, it's
roughly $5 of expense for every $10 of revenue. So they've improved and expanded that profit margin, which will
only help us on the upside and mitigate things on the downside.

Garrett Anthony Holland Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thanks and good morning. I just had a follow-up on loan growth. The [ph] ACA (00:55:03) data for C&I lending for
the industry has softened considerably. I was hoping you could elaborate on what's driving your improving
pipeline activity following the good performance in 2019.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. We are seeing a strong pipeline this quarter and we've had – even our what I'll call core commercial, so
that's our commercial teams that are out in the markets, not specialty. We had good year-over-year growth there.
As you know, we've hired additional bankers in some of our, what we call, our expansion markets or key markets,
so Florida and Mid-Atlantic, Houston, continuing to hire bankers, as has some of our specialty lines of business.
So, in addition to, I'd say, just doing the right thing day in and day out, talking with existing customers, bringing in
new to bank, being able to attract new bankers who have a different rolodex and can bring in, over time, some of
the clients that might have been banking at another institution. So we feel good about it, and as I said earlier, not
only do I feel good about the type of growth we're seeing but the continued discipline around which we're looking
at these growth opportunities.

Garrett Anthony Holland Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thank you. And then maybe a bigger picture question. In the past, you provided good insight about the heavy
lifting involved to integrate Capital Bank. With outbound calls and training hours and the company's performance
notably improved as you move past that, how do you sustain the core operating momentum as you work through
the much larger IBERIA integration?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Garrett, this is Bryan. It is a reality that as you get into the training around the conversion schedule and
start communicating with customers, it does impact to some extent momentum. The best anecdote to that is, one,
trying to compartmentalize as much of the integration as you can to a small group of people and allow our
bankers as Susan just referred to, our core bankers in the market continue to do what they're doing which is to
take care of customers in their community. So we're going to try to compress any of that outbound calling and
communication to a smaller window as we can.
We don't have the full integration schedule laid out yet. With the Capital Bank merger, we integrated all over one
weekend and we did all the systems conversion. And it's not clear yet how we're going to do all of these
integrations, it could be staged out.
So, our focus as we talk to our bankers and the organization and the same things happening on the IBERIA side
is, is look, let's stay focused on growing the business, let's stay focused on growing customers and community
activity and let's let our integration team worry about the integration. And so while it will invariably have some
small impact, we're doing what we can to minimize that.

Thanks. Good morning, Bryan and BJ. I want to just reinforce on the systems conversion few months after the
merger. To what extent does the fact that your core provider – that you're such a large part of their business, I
think maybe their largest customer? Does that give you some positives that you can leverage off of and are there
any risks that go along with that?

(00:58:55) for example, you're running systems that are running Bank of America. So they're infinitely scalable at
least from a perspective of a $45 billion banking organization.
Your reference is to the IBERIABANK systems and part of the testing we have to do is how scalable is it and what
does that mean in terms of the ability to grow and invest in the systems over the long-term, then that's the work
that's going on now. We're trying to make a systems evaluation that when we get to the end of the integration, it
leaves us in the best position to serve our customers and community to grow our business and to deliver the
lowest landed cost that we can for that systems decision. So it's a complicated decision but there's an awful lot of
good people spend a fair amount of time looking at it. And I expect as I said earlier, in next 30 days or so we'll
have a decision on it.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. So there's still room for change and evolution on that. And I presume that your merger charge kind of long
covers cost associated.

D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. As I've referenced to the question earlier, Chris, I don't think that any systems decision will deliver anything
that – as we sit here today, I don't expect any adverse impact from that. I think that the way we felt through it on
the front end took an approach where while – you might say conservative I would say that it's achievable and
deliverable. So I'm not expecting anything adverse from that.
