Let me now turn it over to Steve.

Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Tim. Good morning and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We are extremely pleased to
announce our third quarter results which reflected adjusted net income of $575 million and represented another
quarter of record earnings for the company. We continue to execute on our plan for 2022 and the business is
performing very well despite macroeconomic uncertainties. We are seeing sustained demand from customers
across the footprint, which is reflected in the robust pipelines and our growth trends.
We are closely monitoring economic developments and continue to believe we are operating from a position of
strength as we head into the fourth quarter and 2023.
Now on to slide 4. First, the performance in the third quarter was exceptional with our third consecutive quarter of
record PPNR. Loan growth continued to be broad-based and combined with the benefit from higher interest rates,
net interest income again expanded at a double-digit rate from the prior quarter and fee income also expanded
sequentially. As a result of these factors adjusted PPNR increased by 14% in the quarter. This performance was
driven by execution of our revenue-producing initiatives and reflected our continued disciplined expense
management.
Second, we delivered another quarter of sequential growth in average deposits driven by commercial. Third, we
were pleased to drive double-digit annualized loan growth again this quarter. With this robust loan momentum and
continued pipeline strength, we are optimizing asset growth at the margin to maximize the return profile as we
enter the fourth quarter. Fourth, we are increasing our revenue and profitability guidance to incorporate the recent
rate curve outlook. Zach will provide you with more details on that later. Finally, we are positioned very well for
potential economic uncertainty with balance sheet strength, including higher capital levels and a reserve profile
that is near the top of the peer group.
Additionally, our profitability and return on capital outlook is expected to continue to support further building capital
ratios. This places Huntington in a position of strength with an outlook that will continue to be guided by our
disciplined approach to customer selection and our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite through the cycle.
On slide 5 let me share more details on our third quarter performance. As I mentioned earlier, we reported record
net income, which reflects our earnings power and ability to generate sustained top tier returns. We've positioned
the company to benefit from higher interest rates with their asset sensitivity and we continue to grow our fee
income businesses. This level of robust revenue supports our continued investment in key strategic initiatives,
which will sustain growth.
Importantly, we remain committed to our disciplined expense management and guided by our commitment to
positive operating leverage. Finally, as we've previously delivered on the TCF integration program and cost
savings, we remain focused on driving the incremental revenue opportunities from the acquisition.
Let me provide a few updates on our progress to date. We've added over 60 revenue-producing colleagues in
Minnesota and Colorado to support wealth management, business banking, middle market and specialty banking.
The commercial teams in the Twin Cities and Denver are continuing to gain traction, adding new customers and
building pipelines. In addition to the expanding middle market teams, we are seeing accelerated loan growth in

some of our specialty areas such as health care and asset-based lending, where we have recently closed a
handful of sizable new relationships in Colorado, as a function of our expertise and local presence.
We are also driving increased productivity from the acquired branches where we have grown primary banking
relationships nearly every month since conversion. We believe this demonstrates relationship deepening and a
positive reception to Huntington product offerings.
Our business banking expansion in Minnesota and Colorado is also showing substantial momentum. We're
pleased to have already achieved a top three ranking or better for SBA lending, which were startups in both
markets. The launch of wealth management in the Twin Cities continues to track better than our initial projections.
The team has been fully built out and we are pleased with the caliber of talent we were able to add in this market.
While it's still early, the team is already contributing to relationship growth. Building pipelines reflect a significant
customer opportunity even against a difficult market backdrop. Based on early successes we are seeing in Twin
Cities, we've expanded the wealth management business to Denver with key hires added during the third quarter.
In our Asset Finance business, which includes equipment finance and distribution finance, which was formerly
known as inventory finance, our teams continue to capitalize on the opportunities to harness the combined scale
to better serve our customers. The business is significantly benefiting from that scale, driving increased
momentum and client acquisition and deepening of existing relationships. We're now the fifth largest bank owned
equipment finance platform in the US, an increase from number seven only a year ago. These initiatives are
ongoing and we expect them to be a significant contributor to our growth over the longer term. We look forward to
our Investor Day next month where we can spend more time on our overall business strategies, as well as how
these TCF revenue synergies factor into our consolidated outlook.
Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.

Zachary J. Wasserman
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 provides highlights of our third quarter results. We reported
GAAP and adjusted earnings per common share of $0.39. Return on tangible common equity or ROTCE came in
at 21.9% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items ROTCE was 22.2%. As you saw on slide 4, if you were to
normalize TCE for the non-cash accounting impact of other accumulated comprehensive income that arises from
unrealized losses on our AFS securities portfolio, our ROTCE would have been 18.6%.
We are pleased with the sustained momentum in our loan balances, with total loans increasing by $3 billion and
excluding PPP, loans increasing by $3.3 billion. Total average deposits also increased $1 billion quarter-over-
quarter and $3.7 billion year-over-year. This growth reflects the focus on primary bank relationships. Pre-provision
net revenue expanded sequentially by 17% from last quarter to $857 million. Credit quality remained strong with
net charge-offs of 15 basis points and non-performing assets declining to 53 basis points.
Slide 8 shows our continued trajectory of PPNR expansion. We expect Q4 to be another strong quarter as we
drive sustainable profitability and highlight the earnings power of the company supported by organic growth
initiatives and harnessing the benefits from the TCF acquisition. We remain committed to our long track record of
managing to positive operating leverage even as we continue to invest in the business.
Turning to slide 9, average loan balances increased 2.6% quarter-over-quarter, totaling $117 billion. Excluding
PPP, total loan balances increased $3.3 billion or 2.9%, driven by both commercial and consumer loans. Within

commercial excluding PPP, average loans increased by $2 billion or 3.3% from the prior quarter. These results
were supported by broad-based demand across our commercial businesses that is fueling robust new production.
Line utilization remained relatively stable during the quarter on a core C&I basis, while we saw higher balances
within distribution finance. Asset Finance, which includes equipment finance and distribution finance, contributed
with balances higher by $1 billion. This included $300 million from distribution finance during the quarter.
Commercial real estate balances also increased by $800 million. Commercial growth continued in our middle
market, corporate and specialty banking segments, which collectively increased by $200 million during the
quarter.
In consumer, growth was led by residential mortgage, which increased by $1 billion, driven by slowing pre-pays
and higher mix of on balance sheet loan production. We also saw steady growth in our vehicle finance business.
Turning to slide 10, we delivered average deposit growth of $1 billion. Deposit growth was led by commercial, up
$1.4 billion. This expansion reflects our initiatives to drive primary bank relationships and new customer
acquisition. We remain disciplined on deposit pricing with our total cost of deposits coming in at 25 basis points
for the third quarter.
On slide 11, we reported another quarter of sequential expansion of both net interest income and NIM. Core and
net interest income excluding PPP and purchase accounting accretion increased by $148 million or 12% to
$1.392 billion. Net interest margin increased, primarily driven by higher earning asset yields as a result of our
asset sensitivity position.
Slide 12 highlights Huntington's deposit pricing discipline. Our low deposit rate relative to the third quarter of 2015,
along with an improved funding profile, gives us the flexibility to remain disciplined on deposit pricing. For the third
quarter, we've started to see our average cost of deposits tick up as expected. We're remaining dynamic in this
environment. We continue to manage the portfolio at a very granular and segmented level to ensure pricing
discipline and with a focus on growing the primary bank relationships that bring lower cost deposits.
Turning to slide 13, we've been dynamically managing the balance sheet against the volatile rate backdrop. This
quarter we continued to execute on our hedging strategy to manage possible downside rate risks over the longer
term while positioning ourselves to benefit from higher expected rates in the short term. In Q3, we increased our
downside protection by executing a net $6.6 billion of receive-fixed swaps and $2 billion of collars. We'll be
proactive in managing our downside risk while closely monitoring the rate outlook. Our expectation is to continue
to deploy downside hedging strategies over the coming months.
Additionally, we are actively managing the securities portfolio to both capture the benefit from higher rates over
time and protect tangible capital. We maintained the proportion of securities and held to maturity flat during the
quarter and are reinvesting securities portfolio cash flows at rates above portfolio yields.
Moving to slide 14, non-interest income was $498 million, up $13 million from last quarter. We drove record
activity within our capital markets businesses during the quarter, with revenues increasing $19 million, which
includes the full quarter impact from Capstone. Capstone's deal pipeline is healthy and we expect it to contribute
to additional growth in the fourth quarter. We remain pleased with the client engagement we are seeing in the
wealth management business with positive net asset flows year-to-date. The momentum in net flows has been
outweighed by market-based changes in assets under management, resulting in lower overall revenue.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
Deposit service charges were also lower by $12 million, reflecting the expected $9 million impact from Fair Play
enhancements that were implemented in July. Our outlook for the impact of these fee adjustments is unchanged
from prior guidance. Our Fair Play philosophy is at the center of our strategy and is directly aligned with our
mission of looking out for people. We believe the effect of Fair Play continues to be a compelling value proposition
for our customers and supports sustainable growth for the bank. Fee revenues were also impacted this quarter by
a decline in mortgage banking, driven by a lower return on our MSR asset and lower saleable spreads.
Moving on to slide 15, non-interest expense increased $35 million from the prior quarter. Aligned to our prior
guidance, core expenses, excluding notable items, increased $49 million to $1.043 billion. This increase was
mainly driven by the full quarter impact from Capstone and Torana. It also included additional compensation
expenses related to the strong revenue and production we are seeing in 2022 and impacts from Merit and Day
Count. The underlying expense run rate remains very well-controlled.
Our efficiency ratio, which is an outcome of our revenue drivers and expense management activities, came in at
54.4% on a reported basis and adjusted for notable items was 53.9% for the quarter. On an adjusted basis this
reflects a decrease of 210 basis points quarter-over-quarter.
Slide 16 recaps our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.3%, within our targeted
operating range of 9% to 10%. As we go forward our capital priorities remain unchanged, with our first priority to
fund organic loan growth. With the robust return on equity we are generating from our core assets, we are
deploying our incremental capital to fund organic growth and drive CET1 towards the middle of our target
operating range by year end. Our tangible common equity ratio or TCE declined to 5.3% as a result of AOCI
marks on the securities portfolio. Recall, this temporarily reduces equity as value marks are taken and then
accretes back over time. Importantly, this does not impact our regulatory capital ratios. Our TCE ratio, excluding
the AOCI impact, increased 19 basis points to 7.2%. Finally our dividend yield remains well above the median in
our peer group at 4.5%.
On slide 17 credit quality continues to perform very well. As mentioned, net charge-offs were 15 basis points for
the quarter. This was higher than last quarter by 12 basis points and down 5 basis points from the prior year. Our
consumer and commercial portfolios continue to demonstrate stability and credit quality. Non-performing assets
declined from the previous quarter and have reduced for five consecutive quarters. Criticized loans have reduced
both from the prior quarter and prior year. Allowance for credit losses was up 2 basis points to 1.89% of total
loans, reflecting a conservative reserve posture, given the heightened economic uncertainty even as our internal
portfolio metrics show stability.
Turning to slide 18, let me update our latest forecast for Q4. Our guidance assumes the consensus economic
outlook through year end and incorporates the rate curve as of the end of September. Our loan growth guidance
remains unchanged at high single-digit growth rate on a year-over-year basis. We are currently tracking toward
the higher end of this range. As a result of balance sheet growth and the rate curve outlook, we are again revising
guidance higher for net interest income. We now expect core net interest income on a dollar basis excluding PPP
and purchase accounting accretion to be up in the high-20s to low-30s percentage growth rate for the fourth
quarter on a year-over-year basis. In fee income, we now expect it to be down low single digits for the fourth
quarter on a year-over-year basis.
This guidance is reduced from our prior level. We continue to see encouraging trends in core strategic growth
areas within fees, namely our capital markets, wealth and advisory and payments businesses. And the prior
trends we have been seeing in other major fee lines, including mortgage, are within expected levels. The change
in our guidance is related to the decision to hold on sheet the guaranteed portion of our SBA loan production.

Market sale premiums for those assets have reduced and it is now more advantageous for us to hold that
production on sheet in Q4 as opposed to selling. We will forgo an acceleration of fees this quarter but benefit from
higher spread income out into 2023 and beyond. We believe this is a good economic return but will cause fee
recognition in Q4 to be lower than prior expectations.
On expenses, our expectation is for core expenses to be up low single digits in the fourth quarter compared to the
prior quarter. We continue to maintain tight control of underlying core expenses while also seeing some impacts
from compensation driven by the strong performance and profitability we are seeing in our 2022 results. Given the
higher earnings, we now expect our tax rate to be approximately 19%.
Finally, before we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few key points. As Steve mentioned earlier, our business is
performing exceptionally well right now with solid momentum in the underlying drivers and expanding profitability.
We also continue to see strength in our customer trends where they appear to be managing through the
environment well and with solid credit performance. Notwithstanding these clear positives, we are mindful of the
heightened uncertainty and risks in the environment. We're closely monitoring the impacts from persistently high
inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical instability and market volatility. The cone of uncertainty around the near-
term economic environment has widened, and the probability of a recession is increasing. A bedrock part of the
way we manage our business is to be dynamic, to ensure we have game plans ready and are positioned to act, to
manage through a multitude of scenarios while sustaining top tier performance. And as always we are guided by
our moderate to low risk appetite through the cycle. We are operating from a position of strength and we are
confident in our ability to successfully manage a range of economic environments. We're looking forward to
hosting many of you at our upcoming Investor Day on Thursday, November 10th in New York City and via
webcast. We're excited to share more about our strategic growth objectives and our targets to continue to drive
top performance and value creation over the years to come.
With that we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to Q&A. Tim, over to you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: At this time we'll be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
And our first question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for all the time this morning. What I wanted to just dig into is how we should be thinking
about momentum into 2023 from a loan growth perspective. You've got accelerating growth there and you've got
some NIM benefits that are coming from the mix shift. And I just wanted to understand the dynamic as we should
be thinking about loan growth versus peak NIM given particularly the hedges that you're adding? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. Great question. Thank you. This is Zach. I'll take that. I think in terms of loan growth we continue to see
quite a bit of momentum as we discussed in the prepared remarks even as we're taking opportunities here in the
fourth quarter to optimize where we're driving that incremental production for higher capital returns. And so expect
to see continued momentum into the fourth quarter and that will continue into 2023. Notwithstanding the economic
uncertainty, we continue to see demand from our clients and pipelines that even as they're pulling through are
refilling. And so that indicates continued momentum out into 2023 and beyond. And I think as we drive that we'll
also benefit from higher asset yields to the point of your question. And that will support expanding NIM here into
the fourth quarter in the near term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And the hedge impact, can you just talk through how we should be thinking about that as we go, migrate through
the next four to eight quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. As it relates to hedging, sort of taking a step back, we purposely took a series of actions in 2021, as we've
discussed, to increase the asset sensitivity of the business and to benefit from higher rates. And that really bore
through over the course of the last several quarters, just in Q2 and Q3 of this year, 55 basis points of total core
NIM expansion. And there's more opportunity ahead. The strategy that we're working through is really based on
history, where if you look at the long-term history around rate cycles, typically medium to long-term rates begin to
fall right at the peak of the Fed hiking cycle. And so even as we're continuing to benefit from our asset sensitivity
over the course of the early part of this year, we have been adding incrementally to the downside hedge
protection portfolio so as to protect against potential downside rate scenarios in 2023, 2024, 2025 and beyond.
At this point, we've completed around 60% of that total potential capacity for hedging, which, based on what we've
done so far, would protect around 35% to 45% of NIM in down ramp scenarios out into those years that I
mentioned. From here, I expect it to stay asset sensitive and that will, based on our expectations, drive additional
NIM expansion into Q4 even as we're continuing likely to continue to add to that hedge portfolio here over the
coming months staying dynamic [ph] watching (00:25:29) interest rates but continuing to protect against that

downside. So the net of those things should support continued loan growth, as I said, and help to protect and
maintain really strong levels of NIM as we go forward.

your questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, Zach, appreciate the comments on NII into the fourth
quarter. So, the guidance indeed looks like another step-up that the growth rate will moderate as one might
expect. Once we are sort of done with the Fed's tightening cycle, maybe if you can just comment or give your
thoughts around ability to sustain positive NII momentum after that's all finished, it sounds like certainly the
volume side sounds pretty optimistic but I would just be curious to hear your thoughts on the puts and takes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. It's a great question. I think that the model will be that sustained growth rate in loans coupled with the
rising in the near term and then stable NIM out into the future to really drive sustained continued growth in NII on
a dollar basis. The trajectory around NIM in 2023 is very much a function of what happens with the economy
clearly and where the rate curve is trending. So it's – I won't give you a clear guidance at this point. We'll talk
more about that as we engage in future sessions. But our expectation is that 2023 will look quite good from a NIM
perspective and that the volume growth will really support sustained continued growth in NII.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And if I could switch gears to the expense side for a moment, the cost base may be a
little higher than I would have expected into the fourth quarter. Are the compensation pressures, will those sort of
– I mean, are those related to just the strong earnings performance for this year? Will that base that we've got in
the fourth quarter continue into next year as well? In other words, are some of [ph] costs (00:27:45) transitory
versus ongoing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, it's a good question. Really the proportion of expenses in the third quarter that we're calling out as
compensation-related are really are in fact related to the exceptionally strong levels of production and revenue
and ultimately profitability we're seeing in 2022. And our baseline posture for expense management at this point is
to be keeping the core underlying growth of expenses very well controlled and at a low level. The model as we've
talked about quite a bit over time is for us to self-fund investments in our strategic initiatives, execution on the
TCF revenue synergies and our continued technology development program by driving efficiencies in the core
operating expense base of the company through scale process automation, et cetera.

An indication of that is we're continuing to optimize our branch network. We just announced a week or so ago
another 31 branch closures that will be implemented in the early part of next year. And that's just sort of how we'll
drive that efficiency to continue to keep expenses growing at a low level and of course drive positive offering
levers as we go forward. So that's the run rate that we see as we get out into 2023. And of course, we'll provide
more clear guidance as we get closer to the beginning of next year.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I want to start on the deposit side. So in the quarter you grew average loans by $3 billion, but deposits by $1
billion and we saw this mix shift out of non-interest bearing into brokered. Zach, what do you see as a risk of non-
interest bearing outflows, right? Talk about the funding strategy, and where do you see the mix evolving to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. It's a really good question and so it's obviously a key area of considerable focus. We really like the results
we're seeing on the deposit side in Q3 and solid execution of our strategy of driving towards primary bank
relationships and operating accounts even as we're staying very dynamic in really managing interest expense and
the trajectory on that exceptionally closely. What I expect into the fourth quarter is more of the same. So I expect
to see deposits grow into the fourth quarter commercial led and even as of course beta and interest expense
costs are beginning now to tick up as we go into the fourth quarter. It's kind of taking a step back in terms of the
overall funding mix to the point of your question.

As we see it, we're starting this cycle and beginning into the early stages of it from a really solid position relative to
[indiscernible] (00:30:53) cycles. The loan to deposit ratio is relatively low, non-customer sources of funding are
also relatively low and that leaves us in a good position to leverage diversified funding sources to fund
[indiscernible] (00:31:09) we've got. Of course, deposits are the core and that's why we're pleased that they're
growing. But we do have the opportunity to leverage short-term and long-term other sources of funding, which
we'll do in a diversified way to balance the funding sources. And to be frank to put good tension in the system to
really support our disciplined approach to pricing and deposit growth over time. And so that's the model that we'll
use. And I think as we go out into the future, we will see that balance funding.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then to follow up, so based on the ranges that you're giving for the updated fourth
quarter guidance, we can get to a scenario where NIM is flatter, even down a little bit in the quarter, fourth
quarter. Could you frame for us how much NIM expansion you're thinking about for 4Q and was your answer to
Scott's question that you think NIM could hold flattish next year? Is that the base case? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. So I do expect to see NIM expansion into the fourth quarter. It won't be at the same rate that we've seen for
the last couple of quarters, but I do think we'll see that continue to expand into the fourth quarter. As we go into
2023, what happens kind of over the longer term out into the back half of 2023 is really going to be a function of
where we see the yield curve going and the economy as I mentioned. And so you could see stability, you could
see some downdraft. We'll see. I think it's going to be a function of those drivers. With that being said our focus,
as I said before, is really on growing net interest income on a dollar basis. And I think the loan growth that we're
bringing through will help to sustain and support that over time.

[ph] Hi, Ken. (00:33:27)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Zach, if I could follow up on the securities book, I was wondering if you could just help us understand how the pay
fixed-receive variable swaps have helped the securities book, noting that your yields were up 50 basis points in
that book this quarter on top of a prior 50 basis points. It just seems like you're really getting that extra juice off the
securities book. So can you kind of just help us understand like what's the – how long does that help you for on
that swap side? And then what are you expecting just overall size of the book to look like going forward? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Great question. In terms of size we think the securities portfolio is right sized with respect to the size of the
balance sheet at this point. It's about 24% of total assets, 26% of earning assets and I expect it to stay
proportionately at the same level for the foreseeable future. We're essentially managing it for our liquidity as a
corporation at this point. In terms of yields we did see 50 basis point increase in portfolio yield into the third
quarter, which was obviously very helpful for NIM. If I was to reconcile that for you, about 30 basis points of that
50 basis points was from the hedge portfolio. Just under 10 basis points was from the impact of new money yields
coming in during the quarter and the remainder of roughly 11 basis points was driven by a reduction in premium
amortization.
I expect that we'll continue to see rising yields out of the securities portfolio partly as a function of that just
continued reduction in premium amort. The hedge portfolio should continue to benefit us as well as the rate curve
has ticked up just a bit incrementally from the end of the third quarter here. And new money yields are pretty
attractive relative to existing portfolio yield. To give you a sense, team is currently investing somewhere between
5.15% and 5.35% yields here as we enter October. So that will continue to be accretive to yield as we go forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And just a follow-up, I'll ask [indiscernible] (00:35:36) on that then Zach that 30 basis points held, like how
long is that helper in that part of the portfolio, the swaps on the securities book. How long does that carry forward
for?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
It will continue to carry forward for a while here. The tenor of those are multiple years. And so we obviously have
to see where the trajectory of the yield curve goes, to the extent that they drive incremental benefit on a quarter
basis. But they will protect us for some time to come to the extent rates keep rising.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Right. Okay. Thank you, Zach.

Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC. Please proceed with your
questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hey, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Steve or Rich, can you talk a little bit about how you're balancing growth with I think, Steve, your comment
was potential economic uncertainty. Your numbers look clean, but you did have a higher provision and you took
your reserves up a little bit. So talk a little bit about credit and Rich, maybe give us some help on what you're
thinking on provision in reserves?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Let me start and I'll turn it over to Rich, Jon. Thanks for the question. First of all, credit was really good again this
quarter, and we feel very, very good about our position. We talked about it internally being a strong position that
we're playing from and you'll hear us occasionally reference it externally as well. Balanced book, balanced
portfolio, lot of discipline about aggregate, moderate to low risk appetite over many years. You've seen our credit
metrics quarter-over-quarter on the consumer side, super prime. We're feeling, obviously we're feeling very good
about it. Obviously, we're working it diligently. There's a lot of portfolio review. There's very active portfolio
management underway constantly. And the teams are doing a great job. So now that I stole most of Rich's
thunder, let me turn it over to Rich.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
I was going to say there's not a whole lot to add there. But as Steve mentioned and the credit looks really good
with 8 basis points of charge-offs for the year and [ph] credit class and NPAs (00:37:53) are both trending down
for several quarters. With respect to the increase in the reserve coverage, I mean, the allowance went up by $64
million in the quarter and most of that was coming from loan growth. So, we've taken this consistently prudent
approach to our ACL since COVID hit in 2020. And we think that we got a good position of strength right now
heading into a possible downturn.
As it relates to how we're managing the growth versus where we are in the cycle, I mean, we are fundamentally
laser-focused on client selection and we underwrite our clients at all times to how do they perform through the
cycle. And clearly with one coming up potentially, we're paying heightened attention to that. But we're always
sensitizing for higher rates for stress with inflation and other variables as we underwrite our credits. And that's not
13

changing. So we feel that we can grow the balance sheet and grow it prudently and we'll move forward from
there. So we feel good about where we are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Just as a follow-up on client selection, your comment, can you talk a little bit about the consumer as well? I
mean, your numbers are incredibly clean, but are you expecting some deterioration there over time or just give us
your overall thoughts there, Rich?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. We are expecting it. And really when you talk about deterioration, I mean, you are coming off a very low
base, right. With all the stimulus money that came into the system in 2020 and into 2021, the levels of
delinquencies and the level of charge-offs are really unsustainable. So what we're looking at is more of a return to
normal. We're closely watching the early stage delinquencies and they're exactly where we thought they would
be. I mean, they are up off of those historic lows. But if you go back and you look at where delinquencies would
have been in 2018 and 2019, we're not at those more normal levels. And with respect to charge-offs we've had
net recoveries in many of our consumer portfolios in the first, second and even into the third quarter and we do
expect over time that those are going to return to the norm. But right now we feel very good about where the
consumer book is positioned.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is coming from the line of Matt O'Connor with
Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I guess, just following up on the last question first, specifically on indirect auto, I mean, we're
seeing some pockets of, I guess, stress/normalization elsewhere. I think your mix is a lot different [indiscernible]
(00:40:45) so much higher quality, you've been so consistent, obviously you have just like $3 million of losses. But
specifically there, can you talk about what you're seeing and if there's any changes that you're making either on
the origination side or I guess we're hearing about collections being tricky as well? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hey, Matt. It's Rich. I'll take that. So we've been in this business for 75 years and we've been through all sorts of
cycles. And as you know our model was one of focusing on prime and super prime customers. And one of the
benefits that we've developed over time is the ability to put in highly predictive custom scorecards with response
to default expectations. So we're underwriting to not getting the car back in the first place. And we are mindful of
the fact that used car prices are coming down and we build that into our decisioning. If you look on slide 37 of the
earnings deck, you'll see that while we're maintaining really strong FICOs and custom scorecard ratings, our LTVs
have come down steadily since the third quarter of 2020. And so we've got a very disciplined and sophisticated
underwriting approach and the fact that we're I think prudently bringing the LTVs down over time speaks well to

how the book is going to perform. It's a core competency of the bank. We expect the charge-offs to return to
normal. But for right now we're enjoying what we think is a really strong core competency that we bring to that end
of the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Even the normal, Matt, is on a comparative basis to the industry just excellent. So, we underwrite for roughly 20,
25 bps of loss and obviously we're not seeing that now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just separately, do you care to give us maybe a 30 seconds kind of preview of the
Investor Day in terms of what you're looking to accomplish? You talked about strategic update and financial
targets, but anything you want to give us a little preview of? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. This is Zach. I'll take that one. Thanks for serving up that question. We are really excited about the
opportunity to engage on November 10, Thursday, in New York City and via webcast for Investor Day. We've got
quite a robust agenda planned. We'll go through each of our major business lines, each of our key functions like
credit and risk management and human resources. And we'll share kind of an overview not only of the strategy
generally but also what our updated long term expectations are for financial performance and kind of the roadmap
for us to get there. So it's going to be a robust discussion and I think will serve as a great launching off point for a
series of additional conversations thereafter. So really excited about it and look forward to three weeks from now.

Good morning, Erika.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
My first question was for Steve. And Steve, I was laughing at your response to Steve's Alexopoulos' comment. It
was classic. Your efficiency ratio medium term target is 56% and obviously with the help of the business strength
and rates you went down to 54% in the quarter. And I'm wondering if the medium term range still holds in that
you'll look to continue to reinvest back in the business especially as rates are helping the denominator side of that
equation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Erika, if we could defer that question to Investor Day I would be very pleased. But I also very much appreciate the
inquiry.

Second question is a follow up for Zach. I'm going to ask this question another way. I think it was – I saw it as an
accomplishment that your period end deposits grew and you kept your cost of deposit to 25 bps, well below where
I think everybody was expecting you to go. So as we think about your outlook for good loan growth and some NII
growth next year, how should we think about deposit growth from here? Fully understand your message that you
never got to search deposits in the first place, but how should we think about core deposit growth outside of mix
shift and additionally how you're thinking about the terminal deposit beta from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. It's a great question, Erika. Let me see if I can expand on some of that. So in terms of deposits, our
expectation is to grow core deposits into the fourth quarter, as I mentioned earlier. Commercial just continues to
perform very well. I think we're really benefiting from all of the investments that we've made to expand the
strength of the team and expertise and capabilities, not to mention the boost around TCF synergies, which are
really contributing. And so that will be the core driver into Q4. What's interesting on the consumer side, I do
16

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
expect to see some continued downdraft in consumer core into the fourth quarter, but actually pretty encouraging
underlying trends.
What's happening in consumer is a bit of a tale of two cities where the underlying trend in customer acquisition,
household acquisition and primary bank relationship growth and the deepening efforts that we've got both in our
offline channels and increasingly now on the digital channels, are really working and we're seeing nice expanding
deposit gathering from those activities. What's offsetting that is the well-documented phenomenon of the elevated
level of savings and so-called surge deposits from the COVID era are running down. And the net of those two
things has been a modest reduction over the last several quarters. I expect that to continue into the fourth quarter
before the surge balance downdrafts sort of start to wane. And the underlying growth that we're seeing in that
core activity within consumer start to come to the fore. And so we're encouraged about the longer term trends in
consumer. And as I look out over the 2023 period, I expect to see deposit growth. We'll continue to see
commercial probably growing faster but what consumer contributing with net positive growth.
As relates to beta, we'll see. I think we're pretty sanguine on this point that we've seen low deposit beta thus far.
And I think that's been shared very much across the industry and a number of the peers have seen that through
the third quarter. The market is becoming more active, as I said earlier, in the back half of Q3 and continuing now
into Q4. So, I expect to see beta rising in the fourth quarter. It's kind of as we expected. So, not overly different
than what we have been planning for all along. But that is trending.
And where it ultimately goes, in my opinion, is a bit theoretical. Everything continues to track generally to our plan
thus far. But where we're focused is on our strategy, drive the primary bank and operating account relationships,
stay very rigorous in terms of the detailed management and very dynamic in watching the market and ultimately
ensure that we can keep supporting our customers and growing those relationships, which so far has been
working and that's what we'll keep doing.
