Jeffrey Jonathan Brown
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call. We remain in extraordinary times,
the human impact and the economic ripples from COVID continue to be felt across nearly every state and every
major industry. However, even more profound is yet again confronting the deeply disturbing social injustices we
continue to see in our nation.
Systemic racism has prevailed for far too long. There is zero tolerance for racism at Ally, and we proudly stand in
solidarity with our black and brown teammates, customers, and communities. Discrimination of any kind whether
based on an individual's skin color, sexual orientation, beliefs, or cultural background, stands in direct opposition
to everything we stand for as a company.
Fostering an environment of inclusivity is one of our core values. At Ally, our focus on inclusion is not considered
an initiative or special project, but rather deliberate actions that expand diverse voices and perspectives that help
shape our strategy and enhance the future of our company.
This approach starts at the top, including our board of directors and the leadership of our company. We're
committed to continue working to ensure diversity and inclusion permeates every corner of the organization. Our
board and executive council formally pledge to focus more efforts and resources towards advancing equality and
contributing to the elimination of systemic racism, an important and symbolic move that reinforces our beliefs and
values on these issues.
While there is still much to be done in the fight to eliminate broad-based racial inequality in our country, I'm
inspired by what I've seen at Ally and what I've heard directly from our employees. Many of our teammates have
showed great courage and strength as they shared in broad forums with our teammates, their life experiences
have not reflected the ideals of equality, opportunity and basic human safety that we uphold as citizens.
We're continuing to identify internal and external actions to take as a company in driving real and lasting change.
This includes the culture and diversity among our own employees and suppliers along with the products we offer
to our customers that meet the needs of people from all walks of life and backgrounds.
Society has an important opportunity to drive much needed change, and we plan to do our part as we continue to
embrace the power that comes from being a diverse and inclusive company. We have great hope for a brighter
future ahead.
Let's turn to quarterly results on slide number 4. Ally's priorities and strategic objectives remain unchanged, which
provides continuity and clarity for our teammates and customers as we navigate this challenging and often volatile
environment. Second quarter results demonstrate a realization of this approach across our market-leading and
growing businesses.
Following a trough in April, operating conditions steadily improved throughout the rest of the quarter. We delivered
adjusted EPS of $0.61 and core ROTCE of 7.6% for the quarter. Total revenue of $1.53 billion declined only
slightly compared to the prior year, a testament to the power of our franchises. We remain disciplined and
thoughtful around underwriting and credit management leading to $7.2 billion of originated auto loans and leases
in 2Q. This was sourced from 3.1 million decisioned applications and record used volumes.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
During the quarter, the number of dealers that have submitted applications to Ally reached the second highest
level ever, showcasing the broad reach of our platform. New originated auto yields were 7.1%, while charge-offs
of 76 basis points declined year-over-year, reflecting solid underlying consumer payment trends.
We're closely monitoring all aspects of consumer health and will remain diligent in finding ways to keep our
customers and their cars and mitigate losses as we move forward. Insurance written premiums were $267 million,
reflecting lower industry vehicle sales and dealer inventories though trends improved as we closed out the
quarter.
Turning to our direct product offerings, ending deposits of $131 billion increased $14.7 billion year-over-year,
fueled by the strongest three months of retail growth in Ally's history. New depositors grew by 94,000, our third
highest quarterly result.
Over the past decade, we've turned a compelling startup deposit operation now into the largest direct bank
platform in the US, with a simple, but highly effective strategy centered around our customers. Among our other
consumer and commercial product lines, momentum continued to accelerate this quarter.
Ally Home originations of $1.2 billion represented our strongest quarter since launching in 2016. We benefited
from a combination of a robust refinance market and our digitally-based offering that increasingly meets the
demands of consumers who are looking for frictionless financial service products.
The Ally Invest customer base grew to 388,000, with cash balances of $1.9 billion and total assets exceeding $9
billion. Despite widespread shutdowns in April, Ally Lending generated the strongest quarter ever, with volumes of
$75 million. We entered the home improvement space, which will drive incremental volume moving forward
through our partnership with Authority Brands.
Corporate Finance balances ended at $6 billion, up 26% year-over-year, but down slightly quarter-over-quarter as
pay-down activity occurred following outside first quarter revolver draw activity. While the journey through the
coming months will undoubtedly be challenging as our country navigates COVID, this was really exceptional
performance across the board for our businesses.
Turning to capital, as you are aware, we received feedback from the Federal Reserve on our CCAR 2020
submission, including a preliminary 350-basis-point Stress Capital Buffer. Along with all other participating banks,
we were notified that we will be required to resubmit our capital plan later this year.
As one of the largest banks in the US, we appreciate the unique circumstances our regulators face in ensuring
broad-based financial stability. Ally's balance sheet and capital position remain robust. And under the established
CCAR framework and stress process, our capital deployment plans were fully executable.
Now, obviously, given the uncertainties with COVID, we decided to suspend share repurchase activity through the
end of the year. While all banks await further clarity from the Fed, we remain confident in the strength of our
capital position and our proven ability to effectively manage and deploy shareholder capital in a balanced and
responsible manner. Jenn will show you the capital details in a minute, but levels look very solid and we'll do our
part in ensuring the Fed and others understand the strength of our key financial ratios.
Let's turn to slide number 5 to review core metrics. Trends across each quadrant demonstrate our resilience and
ability to deliver even in a challenging operating environment. EPS returned to positive territory as revenues

remained above $1.5 billion shown in the upper right. Prudent balance sheet positioning and improved funding
profile and disciplined credit management power these results.
Deposits, in the bottom left, grew to $131 billion, and now represents 79% of our funding profile. And on the
bottom right, tangible book value, a metric we point to as an indicator of long-term inherent value expanded year-
over-year to $33.73 despite CECL implementation and COVID headwinds. Ally remains strong and will continue
executing in a manner aligned with our values and strategic objectives in driving long-term value enhancement.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jenn to take you through the detailed financial results.

Jennifer LaClair
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, JB, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide 6, providing an overview of monthly trends within
our auto segment. As JB mentioned a moment ago, we saw steady improvement throughout the quarter as
shelter-in-place orders eased and dealers quickly adapted to COVID environment. Many began offering
contactless, concierge services and increase the use of digital tools in the sales and closing process.
Ally's application trends steadily improved, with used volume, as a percent of originations, reaching the highest
level on record, reflecting the supply dynamics and a shift in consumer preferences that fit our model. Origination
trends, shown in the upper right, reflected our prudent and disciplined underwriting approach. Specifically, we
increased manual underwriting in lieu of automated decisioning and adjusted our buy box across our riskiest
credit segments. As we closed the quarter, we were pleased to generate higher year-over-year volume in June at
appropriate risk adjusted returns.
Used car trends in the bottom left demonstrated strong consumer demand and improved auction activity
throughout the quarter. Year-to-date used car values are down 2%, including a 10% decline in April and 2%
increase in June. We continue to embed a decline of 5-plus percentage points for full year 2020, given elevated
off-rental and off-lease supplies coupled with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.
Industry-wide vehicle inventory levels dropped 33% year-over-year, the lowest level in 10 years as OEM factories
went offline in March and April and sales activity depleted dealer stock.
Production has largely resumed, and we expect balances will slowly build over the coming months. In the interim,
new vehicle floorplan shortages will challenge dealer sales activities.
On slide 7, our direct bank product growth continued to accelerate, reflecting the value of our digitally-based
banking model. Retail deposit growth was fueled by a combination of market dynamics and Ally-specific drivers.
Industry deposit levels expanded due to stimulus and related consumer support, reduced consumer spending and
the delayed 2019 tax filing deadline. Ally further benefited from robust new customer growth, a testament to our
competitive rates, industry-leading service levels and award-winning digital platform.
On the bottom left, Ally Home origination trends were up meaningfully compared to prior periods. Consumer
appetite has significantly increased for end-to-end digital products. Our best-in-class NPS levels in the upper 50s
and our continued accelerating business volumes reflect our ability to deliver.
Low rates drove significant refinance volume along with elevated prepayment activity, which I'll cover more on
later.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Turning to Ally Invest, trading levels, customer growth and account balances, all gained momentum this quarter,
between the months of March and June and thus generated the four highest months of trading activity since we
acquired the business in 2016.
As we've highlighted in the past, we're intent on providing consumers with convenience, digitally-based products
and exceptional customer service. This consistent approach has driven steady performance and improving trends
over the past several years that we expect to continue. The strengths and benefits of a digitally driven model are
apparent across all our businesses.
Turning to slide 8, we improved metrics demonstrating the strength of our balance sheet. During the quarter, we
approached or exceeded our highest levels across each metric, reflecting actions taken recently and over the past
several years to solidify our company's balance sheet. These results allow us to remain nimble and focused on
supporting our customers.
Stable, cost-efficient deposit portfolio has increased to nearly 80% of total funding, up from approximately 50% in
early 2016. We've also continued to diversify our liabilities with wholesale funding. While balances have
normalized lower, we've continued to demonstrate improved execution levels with two cost-efficient unsecured
issuances this quarter.
In the upper right, our liquidity position increased significantly to $43.6 billion, reflecting our ability to withstand
adverse changes in the broader environment and remain opportunistic in support of our customers.
CET1 levels, shown on the bottom left, exceeded 10%, well above regulatory minimum. At this level, we have
$2.9 billion of excess capital above our SCB requirement of 8%. Allowance for loan losses of 2.85% or $3.5 billion
represents over there times our reserve balances in early 2016 even as the relative size and risk profile of our
balance sheet has remained stable.
Together, our reserves plus excess CET1 represents $6.3 billion in total loss absorption capacity. While many
unknowns remain around the full extent and ongoing developments surrounding COVID, these metrics reiterate
our ability to navigate the challenges ahead.
Let's move to slide 9 to review the income statement. Net financing revenue, excluding OID, of $1.063 billion,
declined $92 million linked quarter and $101 million year-over-year. While a departure from our ongoing trend of
steady improvement, the long-term outlook for NII and NIM expansions remains intact. The decline in the quarter
can be attributed to several items unique to the current environment, including reduced floorplan balances, lower
lease gains, elevated mortgage premium amortization expense and excess liquidity that weighs on near-term
margins. These impacts were partially offset by accretive retail auto and deposit optimization trends, which will
continue and accelerate as we move forward.
Other revenue of $465 million remained elevated due to strong realized investment gains and robust mortgage
fee income. Provision expense of $287 million was materially lower versus prior quarter, but remained elevated
compared to prior year as coverage grew.
Non-interest expense increased by $65 million linked quarter and $104 million versus prior year. As we outlined in
our 10-Q filing in April, we recognized a one-time impairment on the Ally Invest business adjusted out of the core
metrics, reflecting industry dynamics, including zero commission trends. Despite this action, core business trends

are gaining steam, and we're pleased with the progress the Ally Invest team has made and the potential for this
business long term.
Excluding the impairment, quarter-over-quarter increases reflect seasonally higher weather losses. Year-over-
year, we've remained committed to prudently investing in our businesses for the long-term, including technology
and brand, revenue-related insurance expenses and the inclusion of Ally Lending.
In this environment, we've renewed our focus on identifying and reducing spend across non-essential areas. Key
metrics at the bottom are adjusted for the goodwill impairment charge and other normalizing items.
Slide 10 includes the detailed results of our balance sheet. Q2 net interest margin, excluding OID, of 2.42%
declined quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by the dynamics I mentioned a moment ago. 20 basis
points of NIM pressure due to excess liquidity, 10 basis points from lease impacts and 8 basis points from
premium amortization as mortgage rates declined to a 30-year low. This was partly mitigated by 10 to 15 basis
points of NIM expansion from auto and deposits dynamics, which will drive NIM higher in the back half of 2020
and beyond.
Average earning assets grew $176.5 billion and cash and equivalent growth more than offset declines in floorplan
balances. Outside of these line items, all other asset categories remained relatively stable or grew quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year.
Retail auto portfolio yield, excluding hedge impacts, expanded 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 17 basis
points year-over-year. Lease balances remained flat versus prior quarter and increased year-over-year, while
yields declined due to lower off-lease gains.
Average commercial auto balances fell $4.4 billion quarter-over-quarter and $8.7 billion year-over-year due to the
declining OEM production and dealer inventory as mentioned earlier.
Turning to liabilities, cost of funds improved 26 basis points, the fourth consecutive quarter-over-quarter decline, a
trend we expect to continue over the next several quarters.
Turning to slide 11, total deposits grew to $131 billion, a 13% year-over-year increase. Retail deposit growth of
$9.7 billion exceeded our next highest quarterly growth by 55% or $3.4 billion. We expect our growth trajectory
will continue moving forward, but will reflect dynamics associated with the delayed tax filing deadline and potential
stimulus activity.
In the bottom left, retail deposit rates declined 24 basis points linked quarter and 58 basis points year-over-year.
We've remained disciplined and focused in our pricing decisions, balancing competitive dynamics and
preservation of customer loyalty that we've earned over time. We generated our 10th consecutive quarter of an
industry-leading 96% customer retention rate.
And as JB covered earlier, customer growth of 94,000 push us over 2.1 million customers, nearly doubling early
2016 levels. We're also pleased to be recognized by Kiplinger as the Best Internet Bank for the fourth consecutive
year.
Let's turn to capital on slide 12, CET1 ended at 10.1% in Q2, well above recent trends due to earnings growth,
lower RWAs and the suspension of share repurchases. As a reminder, we elected to defer capital-related impacts

associated with CECL until the beginning of 2022 per guidance provided by the Federal Reserve. This week, our
board of directors approved the Q3 common dividend of $0.19 per share, payable on August 14.
In the bottom left, we've summarized CCAR 2020 feedback from the Federal Reserve regarding our CET1
operating requirement of 8% as compared to our internal target of 9%. While in a normal operating environment,
this result would position us to execute our planned capital actions, we remain in a holding pattern for further
details on the resubmission process. Our Q2 ending reserves equaled 70% of our internal nine-quarter stress
losses and 41% of the 2020 fed estimates with the variance driven by retail and commercial auto modeling
assumptions.
So to put that in context, during the Great Financial Crisis, Ally's retail auto portfolio losses roughly doubled for
one to two quarters compared to fed model losses that more than doubled for the entire nine-quarter horizon.
Similarly, while Ally's commercial auto losses peaked at 35 basis points of annual NCOs, a level reflective of the
secured highly liquid portfolio, the fed average NCOs for C&I, two-thirds of which is commercial, is 2.8% across
the nine-quarter horizon.
These variances account for between $2 billion and $3 billion of higher fed model stress losses. Despite these
differences, our planned capital distributions remained well within the prescribed SCB framework. We recognize
the fluid nature of the environment, but feel good about our strong capital levels and our ability to remain nimble in
our deployment.
Asset quality details are on slide 13. Consolidated net charge-offs of 58 basis points increased 3 basis points
compared to prior year. Net charge-offs of $178 million declined $4 million year-over-year, driven by lower retail
auto, which was largely offset by Corporate Finance activity.
Moving to retail auto details on the bottom, a few broad comments on what we're seeing embedded within our
results this quarter. Overall, actual credit performance has been stronger than we anticipated at the onset of
COVID-19. While much remains unknown around the ongoing economic environment, comprehensive stimulus
support programs and proactive customer engagement actions to-date have driven encouraging trends. Robust
payment activity occurred across our non-deferred customers materially lowering frequency year-over-year.
There was a modest increase in severity as used vehicle values declined and repossession volume decreased
due to state-imposed moratoriums in place through June. And related to the deferred population, accounting
guidance led to $50 million increase in NCOs, we expect actual losses to be below this level as we work through
our standard process to keep our customers in their cars. Collectively, this resulted in retail auto NCOs of 76
basis points, a decline of 20 basis points year-over-year. Delinquencies performed favorably versus our
expectations overall even considering deferral program impact. Based on these trends, we still believe our full-
year NCOs will remain within our previously stated 1.8% to 2.1% range.
Slide 14 provides additional detail on reserve levels and coverage. Reserves of $3.35 billion and coverage of
2.85% increased at the consolidated level, reflecting higher retail auto coverage levels and the impact of declining
floor plan, which carries a lower coverage, given the strong credit profile of the portfolio. The reserve walk on the
bottom reflects the Q2 impact of the deteriorating macroeconomic forecast, including unemployment peaking
above 14% before declining to 10% by year-end 2020 and then migrating to our CECL model's 6% historic mean.
We've continued to exclude any stimulus-related benefit or assumptions within our modeling. Loss absorption
capacity of this magnitude prepares us to navigate the elevated NCO activity we are expecting in the coming
quarters.

On slide 15, we've included an update on our auto deferral program. Cumulatively, 1.3 million auto customers
enrolled with 87% in current payment status. Customer payment trends increased every month during the quarter
with 24% of our customers paying in June prior to their scheduled due date, supporting our view that many used
the program for added payment flexibility.
On the right-hand side of the page, we've included a monthly view of deferment expiration timing. 30% of the total
population have scheduled expirations during the quarter, including the majority of customers who entered the
program in 30-plus delinquency status. Payment trends for this population have been in line with our
expectations.
Balance of the deferral expirations will occur over the next few months. Keep in mind, the vast majority of these
customers enter the deferment in a non-delinquent payment status. We've remained proactive in preparing for this
phase of the program, managing staffing levels, launching new digital payment tools and maintaining steady
engagement with participants, and we are pleased, overall, with outcomes to-date.
On slide 16, I'll highlight a few additional metrics in the auto segment. Net financing revenue trends reflect lower
commercial balances, LIBOR levels and lower lease gains. Noninterest expense declined seasonally quarter-
over-quarter and was substantially flat year-over-year. The resilient and adaptable nature of our auto business
was fully reflected this quarter, where estimated retail new origination yields remained above 7% for the ninth
consecutive quarter. We seamlessly transitioned a consumer preference for used and we were opportunistic, as
we've done in the past, among established and emerging industry players.
Let's turn to slide 17. Q2 auto originations of $7.2 billion declined quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year
reflecting industry dynamics. Average FICO and nonprime volumes remained steady. Used comprised 60% of
origination, the highest level we've seen of the company. And in the bottom left, ending consumer assets were up
slightly quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year to $81.5 billion, while commercial assets on the bottom right
declined, as described a few moments ago.
Insurance results are on slide 18. Core pre-tax income of $39 million in Q2, was down $38 million this linked
quarter due to seasonally higher weather losses, and up $43 million year-over-year as realized gains offset
weather losses that normalized higher selling historically low levels in 2019. Written premiums of $267 million
declined year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, reflecting lower floorplan levels and declining vehicle sales.
Underlying trends steadily improved throughout the quarter as June written premium levels were higher versus
prior year.
Turning to slide 19, Corporate Finance core pre-tax income was $31 million in the quarter, up $95 million quarter-
over-quarter and down $16 million year-over-year. Ending assets declined $366 million during the quarter,
reflecting repayment of approximately 60% of elevated Q1 credit line draws related to the pandemic and
additional pay downs from some borrowers who received government stimulus.
We charged off two credits during the quarter that were impacted by COVID-19. These exposures were largely
reserved for and had a provision impact of $6 million in Q2. Our origination strategy remains focused on a steady
approach to growing balances and returns, while managing risk largely through asset-based yields. We continue
to monitor criticized and nonaccrual loan trends along with ongoing developments among our client base.
On slide 20, mortgage pre-tax income of $8 million in Q2 declined versus prior quarter and year-over-year due to
the impact of elevated prepayment activity within the bulk portfolio. Direct-to-consumer origination volume was
robust as we continued leveraging existing relationships with 50% of originations sourced from an existing Ally

customer. The low rate environment drove strong refinance activity for us, representing 78% of originations in the
quarter. We're encouraged by these trends and expect volume to remain strong as we move forward.
I'll close by reiterating how proud I am of our Ally teammates who remain the driving force behind our results. We
will continue positioning the company for the future, focusing on Doing It Right for our customers and communities
and delivering long-term value for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it back to JB.

Jeffrey Jonathan Brown
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Jenn. On slide number 21, let me reiterate our strategic priorities. At Ally, we diligently and purposely
build our company upon pillars of strength to prepare us for turbulent times and being able to navigate the full
economic cycle. I am grateful for how our associates continue to do it right and remain resilient in the face of
adversity. Ally's success is a result of the great work they do every day.
Our values will continue to guide our work protocols as we prioritize safety and well-being during this pandemic.
We'll also stay dedicated to building a company where no one is excluded for who they are or the color of their
skin. For our customers, we often use the words relentless and obsessed to describe the approach we take in
meeting their financial needs and we are energized to see how this has turned into accelerating results within our
businesses.
We take great pride in being a comprehensive and digitally focused consumer and commercial finance provider,
and we will continue innovating and adapting. We have a strong well-positioned balance sheet with a deeply
rooted foundation across funding capital and liquidity that will ensure we remain a source of strength for
customers over the long term.
While this environment caused us to mutually terminate the CardWorks acquisition, I want to reiterate my utmost
respect for Don Berman and his team and the strong business they built. I'd also like to thank the employees of
both companies who shared great dedication and professionalism over the past several months working on this
deal. So at Ally, we will stay focused on protecting and caring for the valuable businesses we already have and
finding unique opportunities to further scale and grow those businesses in a disciplined and thoughtful manner.
I'm amazed at how this company has evolved and accelerated its progression and I'm confident that's going to
continue. We'll also leverage our digital model and unique brand and financial services in the way we serve our
customers, and as you know, trends are clearly on our side. There's no doubt there is a great deal of uncertainty
that lies ahead in the months ahead, but Ally's results this quarter demonstrate we're equipped to successfully
navigate and win in challenging environments.
And with that Daniel, I think we can go into Q&A

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Good morning. Thank you. I guess, first question on the reserve build. I was wondering, Jenn, if you could just
walk through some of the assumptions you've made around the outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. And good morning, Sanjay. Yes, and I mentioned in the script here, the macroeconomic
assumptions. We essentially had unemployment, which is our biggest macroeconomic driver hit about 14% here
in Q2, then glide down to about 10% year-end, and then revert to our mean under CECL at about 6% towards the
end of 2021. And that did drive a bit more of a reserve and drive our coverage up a bit this quarter.
We also have not embedded any assumptions around kind of stimulus or the deferred population, just some of
the relief that we've provided to our forbearance programs. So we haven't embedded any of that either. Yeah, and
at this point, we feel really good about the reserve coverage levels. So on retail auto, we're 4.09% coverage rate;
our NCO levels, we've reiterated the 1.8% to 2.1% range that we feel like we're in a great spot in terms of the
reserve coverage, at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then my follow-up question, JB, is for you on the CardWorks deal. Given it's behind you now, I
was just curious if that all experience has changed any views in terms of the diversification efforts you were
considering. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Sanjay. I mean, obviously, we have been saying for quite some time, we still like
the unsecured space. And I think that remains true. But obviously, you have to reflect on the environment that
you're in and the fact that there's going to be challenges out there for the next while. So for us, I think, the focus in
the short term, what I call, over the next 12 to 24 months is really keeping our head down, caring for the
franchises in-house.
I mean, I think as Jenn showed and demonstrated in her comments, I mean, all the newer businesses are really
starting to accelerate, and we feel very good about that. I mean, Ally Lending's got a number of bright spots; Ally
Home, bright spots; Ally Invest, the same. And then, auto and deposits are just phenomenally well-positioned right
now.
And I think our focus and what we've done on the used space is just working really, really well. I mean, emerging
players like EchoPark, Carvana, just great partners there, and then the traditional dealer base. We just got great
relationships with dealers across the country.

And so, we're comfortable in the positions for now. And I think just in this environment, you got to care for what
you have more than anything. And long term, we'll go through and continue to assess, like, I think all of our
shareholders would expect us to do what makes sense for Ally for the long run.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I wanted to dig in a little bit on the outlook for net charge-offs that you indicated for the full year, Jenn, especially,
given that you've got some deferments coming out over the next few months. And when I look at the slide 15, you
highlight that the early payment trends for customers exiting deferment is aligned with expectations. Maybe you
could help us understand what those expectations are? And how we should anticipate deferment roll-offs
impacting delinquencies and then net charge-offs because you're implying a pretty big uptick in the second half
NCO, so just want to get some color around that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question, Betsy. All are good questions. And the theme here is going to be a lot still-
to-be determined at this point. But let me just hit on deferment population and then the non-deferment population.
But within deferment, we've seen about 30% of our account scheduled to expire at this point. And we have some
expectations in terms of payment activity rolled to NCO and rolled to delinquency bucket. And as I mentioned, I'd
say performance to-date is largely in line. But you also have to keep in mind, there's stimulus in the system. We
don't know what's going to recur, just from an overall pandemic rollout or additional stimulus. And so, we're going
to continue to watch that population very, very closely. But as I mentioned, kind of everything is in line with
expectation.

Next quarter, we have any additional 17% of that deferment population scheduled to expire. So this is our much
higher credit quality population. So we believe that they're going to perform well. But that's a large percent of
accounts. And we just have to see how that performs over the next couple of months. And because those two
populations are largely to-date performing in line with expectations, we're still expecting kind of that 1.8% to 2.1%
retail auto NCO rate that we put out in the first quarter.
So everything right now is still consistent, in line with expectations. But I will say that, there is a lot more to come.
We are very much in the early innings of seeing how the deferral population works, and we'll continue to monitor it
extremely closely. And then, in the non-deferral population and you kind of – you see this in the overall NCO rate,
the retail auto coming down 20 basis points, 30-plus DQ is coming down about 70 basis points. We continue to
see just really robust performance in that population. But again, a lot on Home relative to the overall impact of the
pandemic, the macroeconomic environment stimulus, et cetera, but so far so good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then just the follow-up question has to do with the outlook for used-car prices. I think you indicated in
prepared remarks keeping the – down 5% for the full year. I think we just heard this morning Manheim saying that
used-car prices are up 11% year-on-year in the first couple of weeks of July. And wanted to understand if that
makes sense to you given your mix? I know your mix is a little bit more skewed to SUV and truck.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, couple of dynamics that play there. I mean, we came into this year guiding towards kind of a 5% to
7% decline in used-vehicle prices, entirely just driven by supply dynamics with a lot of off-vehicles coming into the
market. As we came through Q2 with this pandemic, we saw a precipitous drop in used-vehicle prices. So it's
about 10% drop in April, which very quickly recovered to a plus 2% as we ended Q2 here. And we're still seeing
strong signs as we come here into July.
But with all the volatility around new vehicle prices, knowing how quickly and materially they can move around on
us, we're still guiding towards kind of a 5-plus percent decline in used-vehicle prices. And then, we'll see where it
goes from here. I think the positive dynamic is new vehicle inventory is still pretty low in this environment with
stress on the consumer. The value of the used vehicle outweighs that of a new from a pricing perspective, so
those are all positive dynamics.
On the negative here, health of the consumer could further deteriorate and overall demand could decline, and we
still do have the supply side challenges. So, we're just being measured knowing that this is a line item that can
move around very quickly on us.

Operator: Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Jenn, I appreciate the comments that you made about the payments. Could you talk just a little bit
about how you think about the way the consumer has behaved thus far, the ones in deferment, the ones out of
deferment and the potential for intervention? And how do you think that – if you had taken that into account, how
would that impact your expected loss reserving those elements?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Sure. Sure, Moshe. So, consumer behavior, let me start there. What I would say is a lot of our consumers, as we
were expecting, use this program as kind of an insurance policy against what's to come with COVID. And we went
out with a program that was open to everyone, we made it very easy to enroll. And we've seen, over the last
couple of months, an increase in payment rates even while the payments weren't due. So, that started in kind of in
retail auto about approaching 20%. We ended June almost a quarter of our customers were making payments in
spite of the fact that their deferrals weren't expiring. And so, we're very encouraged by that.
I'd say underneath the covers, just on the more stressed population that was scheduled to expire this quarter,
we've been pleased the vast majority of them are paying and are in current status but some are in delinquency,
and we're just expecting those to, at some point, roll or potentially go to NCO, which is why we've been very
consistent in terms of our NCO expectations on this population.
Relative to the stimulus, I mean, we absolutely think that that's a net positive here. I mean, if you look at savings
rates across the consumer, they continue to grow. We're seeing strong payment rates not only in retail auto, but
also in mortgage as well as Ally Lending. And certainly, we think stimulus is a net plus from a loss perspective
and from a payment perspective, but also we're clearly seeing that in the deposit trend across Ally as well as the
rest of the industry.
But I feel good right now just in terms of – trends are in line with expectations. We've kept consistency around the
NCO projections this year, and certainly we're very well-covered relative to those expectations, Moshe.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. And for a follow-up, you show in the slides that deposit costs were 1.64% for the second quarter,
and you mentioned that that's going to be a driver going into Q3. Could you talk about what that would be kind of
marked to today's rate and what your plans are for deposit rates, given the strong growth in liquidity that you've
got?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. And, yeah, I'm sure you've seen on OSA, which is going to be a very big driver of NII and the NIM
expansion I talked about in the back half of 2020 and going into 2021. OSA rates are down to 1%. That's really
going to help us, and we moved down kind of July 8, so early this month. And that's really going to help propel our
NII and our NIM. And if you think about that OSA rate kind of the beta on that relative to the beta on the retail
auto, new origination pricing is 2 times. And that's really what's going to funnel that continued growth in net
interest income.

We continue to be very strong in terms of retail originated yields, over 7% for nine consecutive quarters now. That
could move around a little bit as we go into the second half, but there's clearly opportunities for our overall retail
auto book to migrate up towards that 7% we've been originating for so much – so many quarters in a row.

Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Wildhack of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Good morning, guys. Just to follow up on the originated yields over 7%, I think that might have been better than
you had expected. What were the drivers there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, a couple of dynamics, one is we continue to see just record levels of used, which tend to carry a higher
yield, so just the favorability on mix overall. And then we continue to have strong flows coming from some of the
emerging players in the market, and JB mentioned a couple of the names there, and just we continue to be very
pleased with just some of the flows that we're seeing there that drove the yield up.
Now, we're heading into the third quarter here, second half of 2020, we are seeing new originated yields coming
in kind of high 6% range, and we'll always aim to outperform that. But it's going to depend a bit on where the
market lands.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Got it. And then, can you just remind us what happens when a borrower comes off forbearance? How do they get
back to current? Is it just a larger monthly payment? Or is there a lump sum due? Any color you can add there
would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. So, as the accounts are scheduled to expire, we expect our customers to just make one payment,
and that brings them to current immediately. And so, it's just very simple process where you just need to start
paying your loan again. There's no lump sum payment or anything like that, Rob.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. First question is, given over the last several years, we've
seen such strong used car prices, and that means that as leases expire, the market value of the cars is actually
above the purchase option price. As we're seeing a decline in used car values, are you guys expecting a higher
percentage of – or a lower percentage of leases that are expiring to exercise the purchase option?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Rick, I appreciate the question. We're not seeing any big change there, not really. I'd say, overall, with
respect to off-lease vehicles, demand for used has continued to remain strong, and I think that's really what
matters here. Not seeing any big shift...
[indiscernible] (00:49:35)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And then, it's interesting that – and you just said it again and you talk about the strong demand for used cars. I am
curious what you guys think about the supply of used cars, particularly given that there has been essentially a
partial moratorium on repossessions. Do you think that that dynamic will change as we move through the second
half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. What I'd say on the moratorium on repossessions has actually helped to continue to bolster used vehicle
prices. And we have some programs around off-lease customer activity that allowed us to preserve pricing in the
used space as well. So, I'd say that's overall been a net plus.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
I think what you're going to see over the next couple of months, barring any systemic reversals on re-openings or
any potential stress here in the back half of the year, I think you're going to see those moratoriums really run off
and ours has certainly started to run off. So, we're getting much more kind of closer to business as usual on
repossession.
And I'll just go back to what I've said before, which is 2020 was to be one of the peak years in terms of off-lease
vehicles, so we'd expect – to your question on supply, we still expect to see some very robust used vehicle supply
in the market, which has really helped to offset what we've seen on the new vehicle production stress that we've
had, it's really helped to kind of bolster inventory across the system.

Eric Wasserstrom Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks very much. JB and Jenn, two questions. One, a small one and then maybe a larger one to follow
up. The little one just relates to the C&I NCO experience this quarter, which was a bit higher than the trend, can
you just touch on what occurred there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. So, we had two credits that we charged off this quarter. They were credits that have started to
deteriorate back half of 2019. So, we had already largely reserved for those credits and what we saw was COVID
kind of accelerated their movement in the NCO.
Now, I would say just more broadly on that book, the percent of non-accrual continues to remain pretty solid and
stable at around 2%. And in spite of that, we have continued to grow coverage. So, overall credit quality is still
performing well, overall book looks good, and those were credits again that emerged pre-COVID.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Eric Wasserstrom Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then I guess my larger question is this, I mean, there were so many things that were unusual in this
quarter and those things were manifested as you might expect in your balance sheet and income statement. So,
is there any way that you can just help us frame sort of what to think about in terms of quarterly cadence of
performance for maybe the next few just directionally in terms of some of the other key line item? You talked
obviously a bit to the NIM and to the card and fill rates, but there's just so many other things, liquidity position, et
cetera. Can you just help kind of frame what the range of outcomes might look like?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. And maybe let me start first on the balance sheet and then couple of comments on the income statement.
But I mean on the balance sheet, appreciate you recognizing unusual events here, because we would concur
wholeheartedly with that summary. But, yeah, what we saw across the new vehicle space is just the OEM
production has slowed precipitously. Inventories are down about 33%, and so kind of the most unusual thing that
we've seen on the balance sheet relative to expectations coming into this year, it's just the floorplan levels have
declined about $10 billion linked quarter, coupled with the fact that we've had just incredible deposit inflows, you
see just the growth in cash on the balance sheet.
Now, over the course of the last half of 2020, we would expect inventory levels, new vehicle production to
increase, we'd expect slowly to see the commercial balances grow, and we'll be very prudent in deploying that
cash that we have sitting on the balance sheet, but we'd expect cash over time to come down [audio gap]
(00:54:29).
I mentioned most of the other line items on the balance sheet performing well. We could see retail auto balances
come down a hair just because originations are going to be a little lighter this year, but overall seeing strong
mortgage production, Ally Lending [audio gap] (00:54:48).
As we shift to the income statement, I'd say just in summary, PPNR looks to be pretty stable first half to second
half, talked about kind of NII being in a trough, we'd expect that to expand back half of this year. Other revenue
came in kind of at record levels this quarter. We can see that normalize a bit lower just based on – it will be
dependent on our opportunities to take investments gains.
And then the real wildcard here is – it's going to be what happens with the macros and what happens with credit.
We think we've got a great handle on it so far, but there's still a lot of uncertainty in the environment that could
potentially move provision for credit losses around a bit.
I think the company with our balance sheet where it is, we feel like we're in a great position in this environment.
We've got strong liquidity. We've got our highest level of capital that we've had in the history of the company. So,
irrespective of the unusual that continues, we think we're incredibly well positioned. And we're focused on the
right things. We're focused on supporting our customers in this environment. We can do that because of the
strength of the balance sheet. We're focused on essentialism, making sure that we're investing in the right
opportunities to position us for the future, and we feel really good about our ability to navigate.

Operator: Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich of Citi. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. The deposit growth was very strong. And you mentioned that the taxes payments kind of shifting from 2Q
to 3Q. Are there any other kind of temporary aspects that drove that higher PPP loans that kind of stuff that you'd
think of there may be a bit of a pullback in the deposits in the third quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, a couple things I'll say. The overall industry is growing about 10%, and I think a lot of that has to do with
whether that's PPP, stimulus, checks that kind of are in consumers' hands right now and just the overall kind of
defensive posture that you see around consumers in this kind of environment. So, I'd say just across the industry
seems robust deposit growth.
Then as you shift to the digital banks, we continue to win from a share perspective. Digital growth – digital direct
back growth was about double that, over 20% this quarter. So, that we continue to have trends in our favor in that
regard.
And then, I think Ally has positioned itself, which is with our digital capabilities, our brand, our great [ph] rate pay
(00:57:44) that we've continued to win even within that digital.
I think you mentioned tax payments, we did have that roll through kind of July 15. We're still seeing really robust
deposits growth here in July in spite of taxes, and we're expecting that to continue over the back half of this year.
But I mean, there's no doubt that direct banks are going to continue to win in this environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. And then, secondly, that the trends in retail, auto, obviously showed tremendous improvement in June. And
I know, it's still kind of early, but we're seeing COVID resurgence across a lot of the country. Are you seeing
anything in July that's kind of slowing that positive trend that you're having there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean to be completely measured on this, June may have had a bit of pent-up demand, we saw
originations down 50% in April and pop back up to over 10% here in June. I'd say July is still moving forward very
strong originations. I think the dealers and this asset class has proven to be incredibly resilient in this [audio gap]
(00:59:01). And obviously, put all the caveats around that as we don't know exactly what's going to unfold from
COVID and the macros, but I think we feel great about just the resiliency even if we do take a bit of a double dip
here that this industry can recover very quickly.

John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks guys for taking my question, and good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I
guess, over the intermediate term, I'm curious as to your digital channels like Carvana are growing. There's been
a shift to consumers even getting preapproved for loans, be it digital channels. How do you guys think that affects
the market? And how are you guys positioned to deal with that in the intermediate term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I appreciate the question, and short answer here is, we feel we're really well-positioned and have continued
to benefit from being kind of agnostic to whether a dealer a digital, whether they're more traditional, and I think in
this environment, we've seen an acceleration of the traditional dealers becoming more digital and finding a lot of
opportunities to whether offer contactless sales or concierge services. I mean we are seeing the entire industry
shift very quickly to digital.
That being said, with the purely digital offerings out there, we've continued to grow our relationships there, and we
feel great about just being able to support all of our dealers wherever they are on the journey to digital. And like I
said, this environment has really accelerated that movement overall. And we think that's a net plus from a
consumer perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
And John, the only thing maybe I'd add is just as Jenn pointed out I think when we talk to the little, the smaller
one-store dealers and the big chains like Rick Hendrick's Hendrick Automotive Group, their biggest challenge
right now, they just need more cars. I mean they'll tell you that's the bigger challenge. And obviously with the
factories being impacted, there's just not a new car flow coming into them, so that's part of the reason why Jenn
covered, used cars felt really good right now. We still have a sort of a more balanced outlook going forward
because we do think new car production should return, but I mean it's really interesting when you talk to the
dealer base, they really say that's the bigger challenge they face more than anything is just simple lack of the
inventory.
