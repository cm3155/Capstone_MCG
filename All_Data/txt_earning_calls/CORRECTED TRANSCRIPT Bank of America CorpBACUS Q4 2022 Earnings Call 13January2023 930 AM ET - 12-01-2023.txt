Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Lee, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. I am starting on slide 2 of the earnings
presentation. During the fourth quarter of 2022, our team once again delivered responsible growth for our
shareholders. We reported $7.1 billion in net income after-tax or $0.85 per diluted share. We grew revenue 11%
year-over-year and delivered our sixth straight quarter of operating leverage. And again, we delivered a strong
16% return on tangible common equity.
If you move to slide 3, we list the highlights of the quarter, which have been pretty consistent throughout the year.
We drove good organic customer activity and saw significant increases in net interest income, which all helped
drive operating leverage. Revenue increased year-over-year 11%. It was led by a 29% improvement in net
interest income, coupled with a strong 27% growth in sales and trading results by Jimmy DeMare and the team.
This growth well exceeded the impacts of lower investment banking fees and the impact of bond and equity
market valuations on asset management fees in our wealth management business.
The positive contributions of NII and sales and trading were also enough to overcome a decline in service
charges driven by the fully implemented changes in NSF and overdraft fees in our Consumer business.
Importantly, we improved our common equity tier 1 ratio by 25 basis in quarter four to 11.2%, and we achieved
that without changing our business strategies. We were well above our current 10.4% minimum CET1
requirement and above the requirement that we'll have beginning next year in January of 10.9%. We added to our
buffer while both growing loans and reducing outstanding shares in the quarter.
On a year-over-year comparative basis, both net income and EPS are up modestly, with strong operating
leverage more than offsetting higher provision expense. The higher provision expense is driven primarily by
reserve build this quarter, result of loan growth in our portfolios and also our conservative weighting on a reserve-
setting methodology, which I'll touch on later. Last year, we had large reserve releases. Net charge-offs increased
this quarter, but asset quality remains strong. Charge-offs are well below both the beginning of the pandemic as
well as longer term historical levels, and again, I'll touch on this in a few pages. All that being said, the simple way
to think about it is pre-tax, pre-provision income, which neutralizes these reserve actions, grew 23% year-over-
year.
Let's turn to slide 4. Slide 4 shows the year-over-year annualized results, and quarter four results were a nice
finish to a successful year in which we produced $27.5 billion in net income on 7% revenue growth and a 4%
operating leverage. While the year was strong, full year earnings declined as a result of loan loss reserve actions.
For the full year of 2022, again, we built about $370 million reserves, and by contrast, last year in 2021, we
released $6.8 billion of reserves. Isolating those changes, again, you'll see that PPNR grew a strong 14% over
2021. And as I said earlier, the themes were characterized by good organic customer activity, strong NII, and all
this helped by our years of responsible growth.
Slide 5 highlights some of the attributes of organic growth for the quarter and the year. This, plus the slides that
we include each earnings materials in our appendix, which show digital trends and organic growth highlights
across all the businesses. Our investments over the past several years in our people, tools and resources for our

customers and our teammates, as well as renovating our facilities have allowed us to continue to enhance the
consumer experience to record high levels and fuel organic growth.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we added 195,000 net new checking accounts, bringing the total for the year to
more than 1 million. This is twice the rate of addition that we had in 2019 in periods before the pandemic. This net
growth has led to 10% increase in our customer checking accounts since the pandemic, while keeping that 92%
of our accounts are primary checking accounts of the household and the average opening balance – not the
average balance, but the average opening balance for these new accounts is over $5,000.
We also produced more than 1 million new credit cards, the sixth consecutive quarter of doing that, bringing us
back to levels that we generated pre-pandemic. Credit quality, you can see on appendix slides 28 for Consumer,
remains very high on new originations. Verified digital users grew to 56 million, with 73% of our Consumer
households fully digitally active. We have more than 1 billion log-ins to our digital platforms each month, and that's
been going on for some time now. Digital sales are also growing, and they now represent half of our sales in the
Consumer business.
Erica, our virtual digital assistant, is now handling 145 million interactions this past quarter and has passed 1
billion interactions since its introduction just a few years ago. This saves a lot of work for our team. When you
move to the GWIM business, the wealth management business, our advisors grew by 800 in the second half of
the year. Our team added 28,000 net new households across Merrill and the Private Bank in 2022. We
experienced solid net flows despite the turbulence in markets. By the way, during 2022, our average Merrill
household opened with the balances of $1.6 million, again, very high quality account openings.
On flows, when combined across all our investment platforms in our Consumer and wealth management
business, we saw $125 billion of net client flows this year. Additionally, we continue to see increased activity
around both investments in our GWIM business and our banking products. Diversified banking element is a strong
differentiator for us as a company. It also supports the healthy pre-tax margin. This helped the GWIM business
deliver strong operating leverage for the year, and it grew net revenue and net income to records.
In our Global Banking business, we saw solid loan production and growing use of our digital platforms throughout
the year and added new clients to our portfolio. As you well know, the overall investment banking fee pool is
down. However, we continue to deepen and expand client relationships with our build-out of commercial bankers.
Our Global Treasury Services business also grew revenue 38% year-over-year as a result of both rates, as well
as fees for service on cash management. In Global Markets, we had our highest quarter – fourth quarter sales
and trading performance on record, growing 27% from last year ex DVA. This was led by a strong performance in
our macro FICC businesses, where we made continuous investments over the past 18 months. Equities had a
record quarter four performance as well.
Let's move to slide 6 and talk about operating leverage. As I've said to you for many years, one of the primary
goals of this company, which is an important part of our shareholder return model, has been to drive operating
leverage. Those efforts, including investments made for the future, coupled with revenue growth, produced 18
straight quarters of operating leverage, as you can see, leading up to the pandemic. Beginning last year in the –
in the third quarter of 2021, I told you that we've now started achieving operating leverage and got back on streak.
And we're six quarters of operating leverage despite all the things that are going on out there, and the team
continues to drive towards that for 2023.
So, I thought I'd spend a few minutes on the discussion of topics that's been important [ph] to – as we talked
about (00:09:37) investors over the last couple of months, deposits and credit. So, let's go to slide 7. First, on

deposits, there are several factors impacting deposits, as our industry works through and the economy works
through an impressive period; a surge in deposits from the pandemic-related stimulus; the impact of monetary –
unprecedented monetary easing; the impact of high inflation; and then, the reversal of that with unprecedented
pace and size of rate hikes and monetary tightening.
But on a year-on-year basis, average deposits of $1.93 trillion are down 5%. This reflects the market trends, and
in fact, reflects high tax payments to the government in quarter two 2022. In addition, as we moved forward
through 2022, customers with excess cash – investment-oriented cash saw yield as rates increased for money
market funds, direct treasuries and other products. It's probably more relevant to discuss the more near-term
trends. Comparing third quarter of 2022 to fourth quarter of 2022, average deposits were down 1.9%. Noninterest-
bearing deposits are down 8% while interest-bearing deposits are up 2%.
The mix shift is especially pronounced in treasury services in the Global Banking business. Corporate treasurers
managed $500 billion of deposits they have with us. The impact of their activities has a change in the mix. On the
personal side, you can see the checking account balances floating down a little bit from core expenses and
spending, while more affluent customers put money into the high yielding deposits in the market. We do manage
all these products differentially, and the discussion of these deposits by business segment, you can see on slide 8
and we'll talk through that.
So, this breaks down our deposits in a more near-term trend. In the upper left, you can see the full year across
the – for the whole company going across the page in the upper left-hand chart. We also put in the rate hikes that
you can see. On the chart, you can see the heavy tax payment outflows in the second quarter. Then, we saw the
acceleration of rate hikes and deposits have moved to products seeking yield in certain customer segments. But
in large part, what you've seen over the course of the quarter four has been stabilization and more normal client
activity.
Simply put, we ended quarter four of 2022 with $1.93 trillion in deposits, roughly the overall level [ph] as we ended
in quarter three ending (00:11:57) deposit balances. So, let's look at those differentiated by business. In
Consumer, looking at the upper right chart, we show the difference between the movement through the quarter
between the balance of low to no interest checking accounts to somewhat higher yielding non-checking accounts,
money market and savings accounts and a limited portion of CDs. Across the quarter, we saw a $24 billion
decline in total, down 2%.
We have seen small declines as customers continued higher levels of spending to pay down debt and also moved
money to their brokerage accounts even in this business. Higher wages have offset this. While we saw a decline
in quarter four deposits in Consumer, correspondingly, we also saw brokerage levels of consumer investments
increase $11 billion, capturing a good portion of those deposits. In general, think of these consumer deposits
being very sticky of $1 trillion. That stickiness along with net checking account growth reflect the recognition and
the value proposition of the relationship transactional account with our company.
It also has – it reflects industry-leading digital capabilities we offer and the convenience of a nationwide franchise.
It also reflects that the customers in our mass market segments have fewer excess cash investment-style cash
balances. 56% of the $1 trillion in consumer deposits remain in low and no interest checking accounts, and
because of all of that, overall rate paid in this segment remains low at 6 basis points. In wealth management,
which you can see at the bottom left of the chart, more than $300 billion of deposits became more stable across
the fourth quarter.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
Here, you also witnessed a shift to higher yielding preferred deposits, as you can see on the labels, from lower
yielding transaction deposits, as these customers have more excess cash and moved them to seek higher yields.
Early in the quarter, we saw modest declines in balances. But November, as rate hikes began to slow and the
probability of future rate hikes became less, people had moved their money, and we saw an uptick in balances as
we moved through the quarter. This reflects the seasonal inflows that happen in the fourth quarter for wealth
management clients.
At the bottom right chart, you can see the most dynamic part of this equation. Our Global Banking deposit
movement moves across $500 billion in customer deposits. The shift here is what drives the mix total for the
company. It's pretty typical with the exception that it happened very quickly in quarter four, driven by the pace of
rate hikes. In a rising rate environment, where company's operational funds are more expensive, we anticipate
these changes, particularly in high liquidity environments as clients use both cash for inventory yield, pay down
debt, or manage their cash for investment yield. We have seen the mix of Global Banking interest-bearing
deposits move from 35% last quarter to 45% in quarter four, and obviously we're paying higher rates on those
deposits to retain them.
Customer pricing here is, on a customer-to-customer basis, based on the depth of relationship, the product usage
and many other factors. So overall deposit rates paid as a percent of Fed funds increases are still very favorable
to last cycle, even as rates are rising much faster than last cycle. I would note relative to the last cycle that the
Fed increases have been rapid, and we'd expect to pay higher rates as we continue to move through the end of
the interest rate cycle. So just remember, while we are paying more for deposits, we also get that on our asset
side. That is simply why the net interest income is up 29% in quarter four 2022 versus quarter four 2021.
Now let's move to the second topic I wanted to touch on specifically, which is credit, and this begins on slide 9.
First, it is an ineluctable truth that our asset quality of our customers remains very healthy. On the other hand, it's
impossible to gainsay that the net charge-offs are moving to pre-pandemic levels. So in the fourth quarter, we saw
net charge-offs of $689 million increased $169 million from quarter three. The increase was driven by both higher
commercial and credit card losses. But as these charts show, they're still very low in the overall context.
In commercial, we had a few of older company-specific loans, but not related or not predictive of any broader
trends in the portfolio. These were already reserved for in prior periods, and based on our methodologies, went
through charge-off in quarter four. Credit card charge-offs increased in quarter four as a result of the flow-through
of modest increase in last quarter's late-stage delinquencies. This should continue as we transition off the historic
lows in delinquencies to still very low pre-pandemic levels.
Provision expense was $1.1 billion in quarter four. In addition to higher charge-offs, provision included a roughly
$400 million reserve build. This was higher than quarter three, reflecting good credit card and other loan growth
combined with the reserve-setting scenario. So let's just stop on the reserve-setting scenario. Our scenario – our
baseline scenario contemplates a mild recession. That's the base case of the economic assumptions in the blue-
chip and other methods we use.
But we also add to that a downside scenario, and what this results in is 95% of our reserve methodology is
weighted towards a recessionary environment in 2023. That includes higher expectations of inflation leading to
depressed GDP and higher unemployment expectations. This scenario is more conservative than last quarter's
scenario. Now to be clear, just to give you a sense of how that scenario plays out, it contemplates a rapid rise in
unemployment to peak at 5.5% early this year in 2023, and remain at 5% or above all the way through the end of
2024, obviously, much more conservative than the economic estimates that are out there.

We included again the updated slides in the appendix, pages 36 and 37, to highlight differences in our credit
portfolios between pre-financial, pre-pandemic, and current status. We also, again, gave you the new origination
statistics for consumer credit on page 28. The work the team has done on responsible growth continues to show
strong results. From an outsider's view, you don't have to look any further than the Fed's stress test results. We've
had the lowest net charge-offs for peer banks in 10 out of the last 11 stress tests.
On slides 10 to 12, we included some longer-term perspective. We showed long-term trends for commercial net
charge-offs, total consumer charge-off rates, and more specifically, credit card charge-off rates. This compares
those ratios to pre-financial crisis, during the recovery after the financial crisis, pre-pandemic, and then through
the pandemic. So, that gives you a long-term perspective which keeps in context the idea that we're moving off
the bottom in credit cost towards a level which is normalized into pre-pandemic, but that level is very low in the
grand context of banking.
So before I move it to Alastair, I want to just update a few comments on our consumer behavior. Consumer
deposit balances continue to show strong liquidity, with the lower cohorts of our consumers continue to hold
several multiples of balances they had as the pandemic began. These balances are drifting down, but they still
have plenty of cushion left. And while their spending remains healthy, we've continued to see the pace of that
year-over-year growth slow. In the aggregate, in 2022, our consumers spent $4.2 trillion, which outpaced 2021 by
10%. You can see that on slide 35.
Two things to note on that consumer spending pace. There continues to be a slowdown. Year-over-year growth
percentages earlier in 2022 were 14% year-over-year. They've now moved to 5% year-over-year in the fourth
quarter. So what does this mean? Well, that level of growth in year-over-year spending is consistent with the low
inflation, 2% growth economy we saw pre-pandemic. They're also moving from goods to service and experience
and spend more money on travel, vacations, and eating out and things like that. That is good for unemployment,
but continues to maintain service-side inflation pressure.
With that, let me pass the mic over to Alastair to go through the rest of the quarter. Alastair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Okay. Thanks, Brian. And let me start with the balance sheet, and I'll use slide 13 for this. During the quarter, our
balance sheet declined $23 billion to $3.05 trillion, driven by modestly lower Global Markets balances. Our
average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter, reflecting the decrease in deposits and securities levels, and at
$868 billion, it still remains $300 billion above our pre-pandemic levels. Shareholders' equity increased $3.7 billion
from the third quarter, as earnings were only partially offset by capital we distributed to shareholders, and roughly
$700 million in redemption of some preferred securities.
We paid out $1.8 billion in common dividends, and we bought back $1 billion of shares, which was $600 million
above those issued for employees in the quarter. AOCI was little changed in the quarter, as a small benefit from
lower mortgage rates was more than offset by change in our annual pension revaluation.
With regard to regulatory capital, our supplementary leverage ratio increased to 5.9% versus our minimum
requirement of 5%, and that obviously leaves capacity for balance sheet growth. And our TLAC ratio remains
comfortably above our requirements.
Okay. Let's turn to slide 14 and talk about CET1, where, as you can see, our capital remains strong, as our CET1
level improved to $180 billion, and our CET1 ratio improved 25 basis points to 11.2%. That means in the past two

quarters, we've improved our CET1 ratio by 74 basis points, as we've added to our management buffer on top of
both our current and 2024 requirements.
So we can walk through the drivers of the CET1 ratio this quarter, and you can see earnings, net of preferred
dividends, generated 43 basis points, common dividends used 11 basis points, and gross share repurchases
used 6 basis points. And while the balance sheet was down, loan growth drove a modest increase in RWA using
3 basis points of CET1. So we were able to support our loan growth and return capital and add to our capital
buffer in the same quarter.
Let's spend a minute on the loan growth by focusing on average loans on slide 15. And here you can see average
loans grew 10% year-over-year, driven by credit card and commercial loan improvement. On a more near-term
linked quarter basis, loans grew at a slower 2% annualized pace just driven by credit card.
The credit card growth reflects increased marketing, enhanced offers, and reopening of our financial centers,
delivering higher levels of account openings. Mortgage balances were up modestly year-over-year and linked
quarter were driven by slower prepayments. Commercial growth reflects a good balance of Global Markets
lending, as well as commercial real estate, and to a lesser degree, custom lending in our Private Bank and Merrill
businesses.
Turning to slide 16 and net interest income, on a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q4 was $14.7 billion and the FTE
NII number was $14.8 billion. Focusing on FTE, net interest income increased $3.3 billion from Q4 of 2021 or
29%, driven by a few notable components. First, nearly $3.6 billion of the year-over-year improvement in NII was
driven by interest rates. Year-over-year, the average Fed funds rate has increased 359 basis points driving up the
interest earned on our variable rate assets. Relative to that Fed funds move, the rate paid on our total deposits
increased 59 basis points to [ph] 62 (00:24:17). And focusing just on interest-bearing deposit rates paid, the
increase is [ph] 91 basis points (00:24:22).
So, even while Fed funds rates have increased 140 basis points more than the last cycle, at this point, our
cumulative pass-through percentage rates still remain lower in this cycle. That includes an increase in the pass-
through rates in the past 90 days due to the unprecedented period of rate hikes. Included in the rate benefit was a
$1 billion improvement in the quarterly securities premium amortization. Long-term interest rates on mortgages
have increased 345 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2021, which has driven down refinancing of mortgage
assets, and therefore, slowed the recognition of premium amortization expense recognized in our securities
portfolio.
The second contributor is loan growth, net of securities pay-downs, and that's added nearly $400 million to the
year-over-year improvement. And lastly, partially offsetting the banking book NII growth just described was higher
funding costs for our Global Markets inventory. Now, that is passed on to clients through our noninterest market-
making line. So, it's revenue-neutral to both sales and trading and to total revenue. And as you can see in our
material, Global Markets NII is down $660 million year-over-year.
Okay. Turning to a linked quarter discussion, NII is up $933 million from the third quarter, driven largely by interest
rates. That $933 million increase included a $372 million decline in our Global Markets NII. The net interest yield
was 2.22%, and that improved 55 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2021. Nearly 30% of that improvement
occurred in the most recent quarter, with the primary driver being the benefit from higher interest rates, which
includes a 13 basis point benefit from lower premium amortization. As you will note, excluding Global Markets, our
net interest yield was up 89 basis points to 2.81%.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
Looking forward, I would make a couple of comments. As I do every quarter, let me provide the important caveats
regarding our NII guidance. Our caveats include assumptions that interest rates in the forward curve materialize.
And we anticipate card loans will decline seasonally from holiday spend pay-downs. And otherwise we expect
modest loan growth.
We expect a seasonal decline in Global Banking deposits, and that the other deposit mix shifts experienced in Q4
may continue into the first quarter in the face of more rate hikes. We also expect the funding costs for Global
Markets to continue to increase based on higher rates. And as noted, the impact of that is recognized and offset
in noninterest income, so it's revenue neutral.
So starting with the fourth quarter NII of $14.8 billion, and assuming a decline of roughly $300 million of Global
Markets NII in Q1, which would be similar to the fourth quarter decline, that would get us to a Q1 number around
$14.5 billion. In addition, we have to factor in two last days of interest, which is about $250 million, so that would
lower our starting point to $14.25 billion.
We believe the core banking book will continue to show the benefit of rates and other elements and can offset
most of the day count. So we're expecting Q1 NII to be somewhere around $14.4 billion. Beyond Q1, with
increases in rates slowing and if balances continue their recent stabilization trends, we expect less variability in
NII for the balance of 2023.
Okay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use slide 17 for the discussion. Q4 expenses were $15.5 billion, and they
were up $240 million from Q3, driven by an increase in our people and technology costs. In addition, we also saw
higher costs from our continued return to work and travel and costs of client engagement. We've seen pent-up
demand for our teams gathering back together in person to drive collaboration and to spend more time with our
clients. Inflationary pressures continued, but our operational excellence improvements as well as the benefits of a
more digitized customer base helped offset those pressures.
Our head count this quarter increased by 3,600 from Q3. And as we faced increased attrition in 2022, our teams
were quite successful in their hiring efforts to continue to support customers, as the attrition slowed in the fall, our
accelerated pace of hiring outpaced attrition, leaving us with growth in our head count.
As we look forward to next quarter, I would just remind everyone that Q1 typically includes $400 million to $500
million in seasonally elevated payroll taxes. And Q1 will also be the first quarter to include the costs of the late
October announcement by regulators of higher FDIC insurance costs. And as a result of holding the leadership
share in US retail deposits, that will add $125 million to each of our quarterly costs or a total of $500 million for the
year. We expect these things will put expenses around $16 billion in the first quarter, before expectations that
they should trend back down again over the course of 2023.
On asset quality, we highlight credit quality metrics on slide 18 for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios.
And since Brian already covered much of the topics on asset quality, I'm going to move to a discussion of our line
of business results starting with consumer on slide 19.
Brian noted the earlier organic growth across checking accounts, card accounts, and investments were strong
again this quarter, and that's as a result of many years of retooling and continuous investments in the business.
So let me offer some highlights.
At this point, we have the leading retail deposit market share. We have leadership positions among the most
important products for consumers, and we're the leading digital bank with convenient capabilities for consumer

and small business clients. We also have a leading online consumer investment platform and a great small
business platform offering for our clients.
And importantly, when you combine all these capabilities with improved service, at this point, customer
satisfaction is now at all-time highs. And we produced another strong quarter of results in Consumer Banking that
resulted in $12.5 billion in net income in 2022.
For the quarter, Consumer Banking earned $3.6 billion on good organic growth and delivered its seventh
consecutive quarter of operating leverage, while we continued to invest for the future. Note that our top line grew
21%, while expense grew 8%.
The earnings impact of 21% year-over-year revenue growth was partially offset by an increase in provision
expense, and that provision increase reflects reserve builds this period compared to a reserve release in the
fourth quarter of 2021. Net charge-offs increased as a result of the card charge-offs that Brian noted earlier.
While this quarter's reported earnings were up 15% year-over-year, pre-tax, pre-provision income grew an even
stronger 36% year-over-year, so that highlights the earnings improvement without the impact of the reserve
actions.
Revenue improvement reflects the fuller value of our deposit base as well as deepening with our deposit
relationships. I'd note the growth also includes a decline in service charges of $335 million year-over-year as our
insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes were in full effect by the end of Q2 of this year.
And, as a result of those policy changes, we continue to benefit from the better overall customer satisfaction and
the corresponding lower attrition and the lower costs associated with fewer customer complaint calls, obviously,
as a result of fewer fees.
The 8% increase in expenses reflects business investments for growth, including people and technology, along
with costs related to reopening the business to fuller capacity. And remember, much of the company's minimum
wage hikes and quarter two increased salary and wage moves impacts Consumer Banking the most of our lines
of business and, therefore, impacts most the year-over-year comparisons.
We also continued our investment in financial centers. For the year, we opened 58 and we renovated 784 more.
And against all of that, both digital banking and operational excellence helped us to pay for investments, and that
allowed us to improve the efficiency ratio to 47%, an impressive 600 basis point improvement over the year-ago
period.
Before moving away from Consumer Banking, I want to note some differences to highlight just how much more
effectively and efficiently this business is running since even just before the pandemic. It's easy to lose sight of
how well this business is operating from an already strong position in 2019. And you can see some of the stats on
slide 17 in the appendix. We can best summarize by noting we've got $318 billion more in deposits, 10% more
checking customers, 92% of whom are primary, 28% more investment accounts, and absent the card divestitures,
we've increased the amount of new card accounts by 4% and our payment volumes are 36% higher. We're
servicing those customers with 387 fewer financial centers because of our digital capabilities and it's allowed us to
need 10% fewer people to run the business.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
Our combined credit and debit spend was up 35%. Digital sales increased 77%, and we sent and received three
times the number of Zelle transactions. All of this allowed us to run the business with fewer employees and lower
our cost of deposits ratio below 120 basis points.
Moving to slide 20. Wealth management produced strong results, earning $1.2 billion on good revenue and 29%
profit margin. This led to full year records for both revenue and net income of $21.7 billion and $4.7 billion,
respectively. This was an especially good result given the nearly unprecedented negative returns of both the
equity and the bond markets at the same time this year.
The volatility and generally lower market levels put pressure on certain revenues in this business again in Q4, but
what helps differentiate Merrill and the Private Bank is a strong banking business at scale with $324 billion of
deposits and $224 billion of loans. So despite a 14% decline in asset under management and brokerage fees
year-over-year, we saw our revenues hold flat with the fourth quarter of 2021.
Our talented group of wealth advisors, coupled with powerful digital capabilities, generated 8,500 net new
households in Merrill in the fourth quarter, while the Private Bank gained an impressive 550 net new high net
worth relationships in the quarter, both were up nicely from net household generation in 2021. We added $20
billion of loans in this business since Q4 of 2021, growing 10%, and marking the 51st consecutive quarter of
average loan growth in the business, despite securities-based lending reductions related to the current market
environment. That's consistent and sustained performance by the teams. Our expenses declined 1%, driven by
lower revenue-related incentives, partially offset by investments in our business.
Moving to Global Banking on slide 21 and you can see the business earned $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter on
record revenues of $6.4 billion, pretty remarkable given the decline in investment banking fees during this year.
Lower investment banking fees, higher credit costs and a modest increase in expenses were mostly offset by
stronger NII and other fees. So overall, revenue grew 9%, reflecting the value of our Global Transaction Service
business to our clients and our associated revenue growth, while investment banking fees declined a little more
than 50%.
The company's overall investment banking fees were $1.1 billion in Q4, declining $1.3 billion year-over-year in a
continued tough market. Still, we increased our ranking in overall fees for the full year 2022 to number three as
we've continued to invest in the business. The $612 million increase in provision expense reflected a modest
reserve build of $37 million in the fourth quarter compared to a $435 million release in the year-ago period, and
pre-tax, pre-provision income grew 13% year-over-year. Expense increased 4% year-over-year, and that was
driven by strategic investments in the business, including hiring and technology.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 22 and as we usually do, I'll talk about the segment results, excluding DVA.
You can see our fourth quarter record results were a very strong finish to a good year. The continued themes of
inflation, geopolitical tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe continued to drive
volatility in both the bond and equity markets and repositioning from our clients. And as a result, it was another
quarter that favored macro trading, while our credit trading businesses improved also as spreads fared better than
the prior year.
The fourth quarter net income of $650 million reflects a good quarter of sales and trading revenue, partially offset
by lower shares of investment banking revenue. And it's worth noting that this net income excludes $193 million of
DVA losses this quarter as a result of our own credit spread movements. Reported net income was $504 million.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
Focusing on year-over-year, sales and trading contributed $3.7 billion to revenue and that improved 27%. That's a
new fourth quarter record for this business, besting the previous one by 21%. And it's $16.5 billion in sales and
trading for the year. It marked the best in more than a decade.
FICC improved 49%, while equities was up 1% compared to the quarter a year-ago. And the FICC improvement
was primarily driven by growth in our macro products, while credit products also improved from a weaker Q4 2021
environment. We've been investing continuously over the past year in our macro businesses. We've identified
those as opportunities for us, and again we've been rewarded for that this quarter. Year-over-year expense
increased about 10%, primarily driven by investments in the business.
Finally, on slide 23, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $689 million, and that was consistent with the
year-ago period. For the quarter, the effective tax rate was approximately 10%, benefiting from ESG investment
tax credits and certain discrete tax benefits. Excluding those discrete items, our tax rate would have been 12.5%,
and further adjusting for the tax credits, it would have been 25%. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 11%, and we
would not expect 2023 to be a lot different.
So with that, we'll stop here, and we'll open it up, please, for Q&A.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. I need a little more help. You gave a lot, but I need a little more help on NII for 2023. You
walked us to the $14.4 billion on – starting point on the quarter, and your words were less variability in NII for the
rest of 2023. So I guess, my question is you got a lot of loan growth, you have a few more rate hikes hopefully
coming through, and I understand the opposite, the flipside of that is deposit migration, some outflows and betas,
but could you fill in those blanks? Because I think – and I won't speak for everybody else, I know I was still
expecting some growth in NII for the calendar year. So maybe you could talk through some of those pieces and
maybe the outflow in Global Banking noninterest-bearing is a big piece of it. So thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Glenn, I'll start with just – just by way of context, obviously, we're coming off a period with historic inflows for
pandemic deposits, and now in Q4, we're beginning to see the impact of quantitative tightening and a number of
sharp rate rises, so that obviously creates some uncertainty.
We don't necessarily have a playbook for that. We've just got to see how actual balances perform, and we've got
to see how the rotation and the rate paid develop. So it's dynamic, it's evolving, and we manage and we forecast
that weekly. So when we lay out for you the actuals on page 7 and 8 of the earnings presentation, we're trying to
show you what we're seeing in real time around balances and mix.
So what we've said with respect to this quarter coming up is we've got to adjust for the day count as we would
every year. That's timing, and we'll get that back, obviously, in Q2 and Q3. And then we highlighted the Global

Markets NII impact. It's always been there. The last couple quarters, it's been around $300 million. It is revenue
neutral to shareholders as we point out, because we pass that along to clients, and we capture it elsewhere in
sales and trading, but it does, obviously, impact the NII. That's why we're highlighting it.
But as it relates to the forecast, look, we feel like the modest balance declines are kind of in there. That may
continue. And this continued rotation from some of the noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing, we got some
pricing and rate pressures, so that's in the back of our mind, too.
And the only final thing I'll just say is we're reluctant to go a whole lot further out. Last year we declined to give a
full year guide. This year, we feel that way in particular because it's just a much more sensitive environment when
we're modeling, when interest rates are at 5% than when they were at 50 basis points.
So, for all those reasons now, I will say this just as a final point, we've just got to – I think we got to stay patient
because we got to see how rates and balances and rotation shake out. And as rates return to more normal and as
customer behavior, and you can sort of see it, it's behaving maybe a little more normally, then we should be able
to resume our upward path over time, but we got to see how this shakes out and that's why we don't want to go
out beyond Q1 at this stage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Fair enough. I feel bad for all of us. Maybe a quick one on credit. Good to see charge-offs down given everything
that's going on in the world, but can you talk through the big – the $1.6 billion sequential pickup in criticized books
from last quarter? What's driving that and how you feel about reserves against that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So you're aware, the main driver there is commercial real estate, and it's specifically around about $1 billion
of it is office. Obviously, there's a significant amount of change going on in office. And what we've chosen to do is
as rates are rising here, we're pushing that through the models. And just with the debt service coverage, it comes
down, we push through the downgrade. So we've chosen to do that.
The performance is still okay. So we're not concerned with the performance, but we're just making sure we're
being tight on the modeling there. It is obviously a portfolio where I think you know this, we're pretty focused on
making originations into office buildings that are leased up generally at 55% LTV at origination. And 75% of that
book is Class A office buildings. So we're not alarmed there. We're just following our own process with respect to
making sure we're current on the debt service coverage.

Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Just remember that we're talking about office with very high-quality underwriting characteristics, all A Class,
etcetera, and so we just have a conservative rating process, frankly. And it's well viewed out there and well looked
at by many people. But, remember, office is $14 billion to $15 billion of the total portfolio, so we feel very
comfortable where we are.

And then obviously, we've built reserves against the portfolios across the board that are strong and reflect the –
as I said earlier, basically a mild recession in the base case and a worse recession in the adverse case that we
weight 40%.

Operator: We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets
Thank you. Alastair, on the loan loss reserving, and Brian just talked about the adverse case being about 40%,
can you guys share with us how much of the reserve building is what may be referred to as management overlay
relative to what the models are specifically dictating on reserve building?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
We don't disclose that, but you might assume that there's a fair amount. There are three components to this. One
is what the models say. Two is basically uncertainty in precision and another thing is we overlay and then a
judgmental. And you might think that there's a fair amount of that right now with the uncertainty, but – so the
model piece of that would be a portion of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets
Very good, Brian. And then when you look at your deposit behavior of the consumer to past cycles, is there any
material differences in the way they're moving money around or not moving money around from their checking
accounts or low-yielding savings accounts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think when you look at the higher-end consumer, not really. They move to – when the rate in the market yields,
money market funds, we move them to it and that's part of what we do. In that sort of investment cash, Gerard, as
we call it, moves, the checking accounts don't move.
The difference, frankly, is that there was a lot of stimulus that was in addition to the earnings power of a
consumer. So we've never had that in history, but – and so that amount of stimulus is the question is will they
spend it down or will they keep storing it up. And they've been spending it down very modestly across sort of
medium income households or so and the general consumer business.
To give you an example, the cohort that was $2,000 to $5,000 in average balances pre-pandemic had 3,400.
They're still sitting at 12,800, but they peaked in early 2022 at 13,400. So they're drifting down, but it's still
multiples. The big question is will they end up spending that down? If they're employed, probably not; but if the
unemployment rate changes and our models assume the unemployment rate changes.
So, I think we're at 6 basis points now in total consumer rate paid. The rate structure's very high. And we're 11
basis points is where we got to. We have very low CD volumes and things have a fair amount of money markets,
but most of it's checking. That's why we showed you the differential on checking.

So, is it different? Yeah. Probably in a mass consumer business, just because they were sitting on more cash and
may use that cash in certain scenarios, but the rest of the behavior's largely the same, including in the corporate
business where people can have less balances and the effective credit rate generates a bigger number to cover
their fees, so they tend to pull the balances out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets
Just quickly, Brian, when you look at the high net worth and corporate, did that move to from zero to 3% Fed
funds, for example, versus 3% to where we are today at 4.5%? Is most that have completed where the people
that were going to move the money have already moved it in those two categories?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I mean, I can't say definitively but you've seen that's where we showed you on those pages where we
showed the account balances are relatively stable in wealth management in the fourth quarter, $300-odd billion.
Basically, they're flat if you look across the last several weeks. So, there's always a little bit of migration to the
preferred deposit which is a market for higher-yielding sort of money market account. But the big shift in that was
frankly in the second quarter of 2022 when, I think, we had $50 billion-odd numbers of tax payments which was a
lot higher than in past years due to – if you think about the 2021 dynamic in capital gains and those things that
went through.
So what we're seeing is the last four or five weeks, we're seeing relatively stable in deposit balances. Quarter-end
three, quarter-end four, basically flat, a little bit of movement among the categories but in that business frankly a
fairly sort of stable place right now. And so I think the long answer – the short answer, if they move the money,
they've kind of already moved it.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I guess, Alastair, I guess no good deed goes unpunished. I mean NII did grow 21% for the year 2022. It did
grow 7% linked quarter in the fourth quarter, up $900 million. But six weeks after you gave the guidance last
quarter, you lowered that guidance by $300 million, and it just raised some questions about the quality of your
modeling or if you had your arms completely around the asset liability management. So what happened to cause
you to change that guidance, albeit in the context of still some of the best NII growth you guys have seen in many
years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, Mike, if I go back to six months ago, quarter two earnings, what we said at the time was we thought
over the course of the next six months NII might go up by $1.85 billion. In actual fact, it's gone up $2.25 billion. So
that's the actuals. And we're forecasting as best we can at any given time, up $2.25 billion. Q3 was more

favorable than I think we had thought, and Q4 was less favorable. And the Q4 was less favorable in large part
because the balances behaved just a little bit differently, and the rate paid behaved just a little bit differently. And
the mix or rotation, if you like, that behaved a little differently. And it kind of makes sense because Q4 is where
QT kind of kicked in.
So, look, we don't have a great deal of precedent. It's obviously a historic period. It's difficult to forecast quarter-to-
quarter. And it's – our models are just a lot more sensitive right now. So I think we're going to try and share with
you what we know when we know it, but it's just a more difficult environment at this point to predict looking
forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Appreciate it. It's like the first half [indiscernible] (00:53:53) you played well. You should have just stopped after
then, I guess. But I guess as we look – so, in other words, that $400 million extra that you got, you're kind of
giving back here from the fourth to the first quarter. So $14.4 billion NII guide, if you annualize that, that would be
still 9% NII growth in 2023. Is that a fair starting point? Can you give us – not big confidence but a little confidence
given that deposits have stabilized, the day count, cards are seasonally lower? So again, if you annualize that,
that's 9% NII growth. And then, Brian, still on expenses, any change there? Or, are you going to keep it to just like
1.5% growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, on the first thing, Mike, there was something I was going to pick up on earlier to the first question. You picked
up going to point we will have growth in NII year-over-year in the range you talked about if you take the $14.4
billion. As Alastair said, we expect it to sort of be less variability and annualize that, compare that to 2022 of 9%
as you said, so you're exactly right. So that's good growth. And I think you'll see as you move through the year of
2023, leave aside the economic scenario playing out, that you'll see you'll move from where we are today which is
uncertainty about where the balances will finally settle in and the plateauing of those balances to where you get
back to normalized growth and normalized loan growth, et cetera. So you've got it right. There'll be nice NII
growth year-over-year.
On the expenses, if you look at your guys' estimates for $62.5 billion which is what we sort of said earlier in the
fourth quarter we're comfortable with that. That's what the average of the Street analysts are in that. But that
takes a lot of good management to get there, and we'll continue to work on it and letting the head count drift back
down and continue to invest in things that provide efficiency. So you've got it. And key to that is the six quarters of
operating leverage and the idea of continuing that going.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then, the last part of the income – or the EPS is simply your excess capital which you highlighted. It seems
like you're well above your CET1 ratio. So, what does that mean for the pace of buybacks and your desire to buy
back stock at this price?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, we've always said that the first desire is always to support business growth, and that's what we've been doing.
We then – we're well above our minimums. We're on a path to close out the requirement for next year. And so, we

bought back a chunk of shares this quarter, expect that to start to increase neutralizing the employee issuances
and then going above that each quarter now, because we – at 11.2-something, we're close to 11.4% target. So,
we're back in the game.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning. Alastair, I know we're asking you to predict a lot of things here. Just thinking about the credit and
the pace of normalization, do you have any sense of where charge-offs kind of might start out the year and what
kind of pace of normalization, if we look at the charge-off ratio that moved up a little bit this quarter, what might
that look like for 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, we're not going to look too far into the future, John. But if you look at our 90 days past due in the credit
card data that we show you every quarter, that tends to give you a pretty good leading indicator of what's coming
down next quarter. So, you can see that the 90 days past due have picked up just a little bit. The 30 days past
due have picked up just a little bit. We're still well below where we were pre-pandemic. But that would tell you on
the consumer side, it looks like it's drifting just a little higher. So, that's number one.
Number two, with respect to commercial, this quarter was a little unusual. We had three deals that we ended up
having to charge off. Not correlated in any way. They're in totally different businesses, and they've been hanging
around for a while, but it was – two of them are fully reserved. So, they didn't come as a surprise. But I think that
because the commercial stuff was so close to zero, it immediately looks like a pop in any given number. That's
part of the reason why we showed those graphs of what charge-offs have looked like over time in the earnings
materials. But the commercial portfolio continues to look very strong.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And you touched on this a little bit in Brian's comments. But just on loan growth, what are you guys thinking
about for this year? And what's the perspective of where you closed the spigots a little bit in the third quarter as
you managed RWA, you kind of said those were opening up in the fourth, but we didn't really see it translate to
robust loan growth? Just kind of that dynamic between what you're looking to do and what you're seeing on
demand for loan growth outlook. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, we said we're wide open for business in the fourth quarter, and that remains the case. Brian covered
the capital point. We had to do what we had to do in the third quarter. We did it. We've added 75 basis points of
capital in the last two quarters. It puts us in a great place. So, mainly what you're seeing in Q4 is just it was a
slower environment for loan growth. A year ago, we were talking about the fact we anticipated that loan growth

might be high single-digits, and we grew 10%. This year, we feel like it's going to be mid single-digits, it's going to
be slower, and it's going to be led by commercial. It'll be led by card.
But things like securities based lending, that's just quieter now. We've got balances being paid down there.
Mortgage is quieter this year. And then, in our base case, you look at the economic blue-chip consensus, you can
see the forecast is for a recession. So, it'll be a quieter loan growth year this year, I suspect, but we're open for
business to support our clients.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yes. Hi. Good morning. I just had one compound clarifying question. The first is, Brian, did you, in response to
Mike's questions on NII, bless $57.6 billion in NII for 2023, right? He was saying 14.4 times 4, 9% NII growth. You
seem to be going with it. I just wanted to confirm that. I think there's a bit of confusion given that you guys were
saying you don't want to go beyond the first quarter.
And the second question is also for you, Brian. I think that you've done an unbelievable job of transforming the
company. And I think the one thing that remains is that the investor base still thinks you as mostly a bank to invest
in when rates are going up, right? And clearly, there's a lot of uncertainty over the NII outlook. But could you sort
of give us what we should be potentially excited about that you can control with regards to the revenue trajectory
from here?
And also, you spent so much time on deposits. I'm just kind of confused on the message in terms of deposit
declines from here, because you've laid out this case that you have this very resilient deposit base, and it seems
like a lot of attrition has already happened. So, that feel – sorry, that was actually three questions in one. I
apologize, but that's it.

I think I'll put all those questions together in one answer. If you go to the page that's in the report where we sort of
say look at the difference between the Consumer business in 2019 and now, and it's something to be excited
about because we have, during a period of time where we were completely shut down in branches, like 2,000
opened back up. We actually went down from 4,300 branches to 3,900 branches. We built out in a lot of new
cities. We [ph] did all those work (01:02:05). We have 10% more checking accounts. The customer favorability is
an all-time high. Our small business part of that business is the biggest in the country and growing.
And you look at that and that provides a great anchor which provides that great stable deposit base we show you
on the slide where we show that base. It also provides a lot of very low-cost deposits, and as rate rise and
materialize that. And then, if you think what happened last cycle, for a year when rates did not move up, we
continued to grow deposits in the Consumer business in the mid single-digits, which just is infinite leverage. And
so, that's something to be excited about from not only the customer side, where we're digitized and Zelle usage is

going up, Erica usage is going up – Erica meaning our Erica, not you, Erika. But the – and the balances of
consumer investments, open up 7% more accounts in a year where investment world was choppy.
And then, you pair that into the wealth management business, same thing. One of the biggest deposit franchise in
the country, biggest – 3-point-something-trillion, high-$3 trillion of assets, growing net households at the fastest
rate it's grown in a long, long time, maybe history, growing advisors. Those are things to get excited. That's the
organic growth engine of the company. You got to put that against the backdrop of a plateauing of NII, which is
basically what Alastair said, sort of think about a less favorability around the $14.4 billion starting number, which
Mike annualized and did math. And so, he did the math and made it out. But that provides us a good base of
which to drive forward. And so, you've really got to get through the economic uncertainty, and then all those things
will start to bear.
Meanwhile, the trading business, which we invested in a couple of years ago, now has had its best fourth quarter
ever and Jimmy and the team are doing a good shape. And so, I – we just feel good about the overall franchise,
more customers, more with each customer, and then that provides a big stable base which, as rate increases
slow down, the marginal impact of it will slow down until we see the good core loan and deposit growth, which you
saw after the last rate rising increase stopped and produced the 20 quarters of operating leverage and things like
that. So, that's pretty good to be excited about. Biggest bank growing its franchise in the only growing solid
economy in the world at a faster rate than everybody else is pretty interesting.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Just to clarify, Brian, you mentioned the plateauing of NII and then hopefully all the investments in the business
would drive growth from there. Is that still possible if we have continued rate cuts through 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
The scenario of rate cuts and rate rises – we basically use blue-chip. So, I'm not sure. It depends on what's
causing that. So, if it's a normalization of the rate curve back to, say, 3% on the front-end and 4.5% on the back-
end or something like that, that's different than what you saw when they had to cut rates for the pandemic or after
the financial crisis and left them there for years to get the engine of the United States economy restarted.
What's different this time frankly – and that's why we're talking about the consumer data – is even with a strong
rise in interest rates, a less tight labor market, and inflation and what people are being told to worry about, you're
actually seeing consumer spending consistent with a good 2% growth environment, a low inflation environment,
which is good because the consumer is being appropriately conservative right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Erika, the other thing I'd just say is you think about why we've got a slowdown in some of our fee-based
businesses right now, it's because rates have risen so quickly, and that's created a lot of volatility and it's created
the asset management business that's had a big sell-off in bonds and stocks. So, we're poised now in a lower
base where we can grow from here. Same thing, if you look at our net income, we've really outrun a pretty historic
decline in investment banking fees. So, we got a diversified set of businesses where, as some normalcy returns,
we can see some pick-up in those fee lines as well.

Thank you very much.

Operator: We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow up, Alastair, you had about $800 million of incremental interest
income from the securities book. And I'm just wondering if you can help us understand how much of that was
attributed to the continued benefit from the swap portfolio. And also then how would you expect that to impact
your outlook for the $14.4 billion in the first quarter guide? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, most of the increase in securities portfolio, we're not really reinvesting in there at this point. As the
securities portfolio is sort of declining, we're using the money that's throwing off to put it into loans. That's always
our first preferred place. So you're picking up on the right thing. It's mainly the treasuries that are in there. They're
swapped to floating. That way, we don't have any capital impact from rising rates.
And so, you're going to see the securities yield just continue to pick up, number one, based off of the treasuries
swap to floating, as floating rates go higher; and number two, as the securities come due, there'll be fewer and
fewer of them at lower rates, and so you're going to see the pick-up over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
And just as a follow-up, what's our best benchmark rate to kind of watch that trajectory for how we can understand
that helper from that swap portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Normally, it's SOFR, Secured Overnight Financing Rate.

Ken Usdin Q

Okay, great. Second quick one just on capital. You had 20 basis points increase in your CET1. You did $1 billion
or so of the buyback. Just wondering how you're thinking about capital return with the [ph] bar package of rules
(01:07:58) still ahead of us going forward. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I think Brian said the right things. The strategy hasn't changed. We've got to, number one, support our
clients. We're going to, number two, invest in our growth. Then we plan to just sustain and grow our dividend, and
over time, we'll balance building capital and buying back shares. I think the difficult part with Basel III endgame
right now is we don't have the rules.

So, we got to wait, I think, until we see those. They'll go through a comment period. At that point, we'll offer much
more perspective. But I'll say the obvious. Banks have got plenty of capital. We were asked to take 90 basis
points more in June. There's a lot of pro-cyclicality already in things like the stress test and stress capital buffer
and in CECL. And I think, look, we've shown our ability to perform and build capital, in this case 75 basis points in
two quarters. So, we'll deal with whatever the ultimate rules come out with.

Operator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Have you guys thought about how to better insulate yourself against potentially lower rates and
not just kind of a little bit of a decline, but if we get something unusual and rates drop a lot? I know it's easier for
some of the smaller banks to do it. But we have seen some regional banks essentially trying to lock in a corridor
of the NIM, so that kind of medium term, it's more about growing the balance sheet versus the rate moves up and
down. And clearly with your deposit rates low, if we do get Fed cuts, there's just not much levers to bring down
those rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, I don't know that we've thought about it in terms of like a corridor of NIM, but we definitely think about
balancing earnings and capital and liquidity through the cycle. So, I don't see us making significant changes to our
core. We're trying to make sure that we operate and deliver in all rate environments that can be high, or two years
ago, it can be zero rate environment.
So, the changes we're – you can sort of see our changes at the margin. You can see we're taking securities out
and replacing them with loans, and you can see everything re-striking higher. So we've got a smaller, more
efficient balance sheet.
We, at the margin, may consider fixing some rates here depending on how things develop over the quarter, but
it's – we've had a pretty, I'd say, good strategy that's allowed us to drive net interest yields. You can see those on
page 16. They're up 46% over the course of the past year, and drive the NII. That's up $3.3 billion year-over-year.
So, we feel like we've struck that balance. That's what responsible growth means to us, and at the margin, we'll
probably still maintain a little bit of asset sensitivity.

Matt O'Connor Q

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yes, we can.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, great. Two questions. One, just a little more color on the loan growth outlook. I heard you on expecting that
loan growth will be slowing as you go through the year, and I just wanted to get an understanding of is that more
just demand slowing, base effects? Or is there also anything in there from you on proactive credit decisioning as
normalization comes through the rest of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, Betsy, a couple of things. If you look in the fourth quarter, if you can see the cards come up, which is
seasonal, and that's going to come down and that's one of the things that people tend to pay those down, the
usage of those cards frankly are still at low levels. The pay rate, the other way to think about that, is still in the
30s. So that's sort of one thing that's been kind of consistent through the pandemic, the customers are paying
down the card balances. And you'd expect at some point those will get back to more normalized pay-down rate in
the mid-20s.
The second is line usage, frankly, has also come back down. It's not gotten ever back to where it was pre-
pandemic and it moved up and it dropped by 100 or so basis points, which, across a lot of lines, is a fair amount
of loans. So that you saw. And so how corporates manage their borrowing and cash and demand cycle seems to
be flattening out a little bit.
Then, obviously, acquisitions and things are way slowed down. So there wasn't much activity there. So I think you
put it together, then you have in the securities-based business, customers took down leverage, paid off a fair
amount of loans. In the wealth management business, even though they've grown, I think, for 50-some quarters in
a row now or something like that in loan balances, it just happens. Mortgages obviously are low.
But what we think is as the rate environment settles in, you'll see that normalize and that we'll get back – we'll be
back on the mid-single-digits. We just won't have the 10% loan growth year-over-year, because that is [ph] faster
than the economy and faster than we do (01:13:19). We have not changed credit underwriting standards, and you
can see that in the consistency of the origination standards back in the pages of the appendix where we show sort
of our cars and home equity and things like that. It's just the demand side is a little soft, because people are
reading the same headlines we're all reading about. A recession is coming and what should – and they should be
careful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, got it. And then, on the expense side, I know we talked a lot about the NII and the puts and takes as you go
through the year that you're looking for. What about stability on the expense line to manage through any worse-
than-expected outcomes on the NII? What kind of levers do you think you have to pull there, Brian?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, we always have the variable compensation stuff will drop because – assuming that the reason why rates are
being cut is because economic activity is worse than people thought. And then, you have the general just
efficiency movements in the house that we are – we've been pretty good at. And then, you have to remember, we
try to get people to go off of nominal expense to operating leverage, and so we have six quarters of operating
leverage.
As the NII growth slows down, we have to manage the company to produce operating leverage. And so, we'd
expect that fees might stabilize and absorb the $1 billion downdraft in quarterly investment banking fees and start
to work up from there in other types of things.
So, I think we feel very good about the ability to find ways to manage expenses, always have. We slowed down
hiring as we came into the fourth quarter, not because we're – because frankly we'd gotten our hiring to match the
Great Resignation earlier in the year, and it was sort of overachieving. So we slowed that down, and that allowed
us to get back in line and start to bring the head count back down to where we want it to be.
But those are – frankly are positions that are relatively – have a relatively high movement rate [ph] and only
(01:15:20) because of the nature of the job. So, we feel good about between variable rate compensation, between
continuing to reduce head count for efficiency, and frankly just activity levels in a down scenario, we'll be able to
pull the expenses down. But meanwhile, we're going to invest $3.7 billion in technology development in 2023
versus $3.4 billion in 2022.
We continue to add bankers. We added 800 wealth management advisors in the second half of last year. Our
training program for those across all our wealth management businesses and other training programs, we
continue to hire young talented people. So, we're trying to maintain that balance of continuing to invest in the
growth, opening in new cities.
We're averaging – these branches that we're opening are extremely successful when you look at the size of them
relative to anybody else's opening practice. And so, why would you stop that? And yet, the total number of
branches comes down because we're managing the expense side. So, we're paying for the stuff as we go but –
and so, you could slow some of that down and get leverage out of it. But the question would be as we're in that
scenario, is that the right decision for long-term value creation.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you. Couple of clarifications on the same NII question. I just want to understand, in your assumption about
the – staying at $14.4 billion through the year on a quarterly basis, are you assuming deposits to continue growing
or shrinking, number one? Are you expecting further rotation out of noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing? And
do you expect the $14.4 billion number even if there are rate cuts towards the end of the year? Is that number
doable even with that? What is it that you're assuming? Is it even with rate cuts?

Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, Vivek, we just said there'd be less variability around that number due to the fact the market stuff has gone to
zero, has no impact on it, that you saw over the last few quarters have impact. So, less variability. All the things
you cited are the reasons why we tend to say you have to be careful about saying what's going to happen in the
fourth quarter of 2023 with great clarity.
What we did say is if – at this level with less variability, you'll have nice growth over this year to next year. But I
think everything you point out, whether it's rates going up faster than people think because inflation [indiscernible]
(01:17:56) or come down because people think that they've done a good job and they want to get behind the
economy, we base our modeling on the blue-chip economic assumptions out there and then looking at our
balances and stuff. And so, I think that's the reluctance.
So, all your points are great points and they're always why we are reluctant to say I can tell you to the three
decimal places what it's going to be three quarters out, because it can move around on you. And to Mike's earlier
point, we grew $1.2 billion and $900 million in linked quarter and somehow people thought that wasn't good
enough because there's math that would have gotten you different.
So, stay tuned. We'll tell you what we know when we know it and – but it's good organic customer growth. 1
million net new checking accounts starting at $5,000 balances, growth in wealth management and loans and
deposit, these are things that stick with you and will be good no matter what the scenario.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Another – a different question slightly. You gave the $2,000 to $5,000 deposit cohort, Brian, in terms of
where they are in the deposit balances. In the past, you've also given a cohort below that, like a $1,000-type
cohort. Where does – how is that doing? Can you give any numbers on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
It's similar. They're all moving down very slightly, that average balance for that same group of customers taken
out. I'd say – so, it's in the same sort of – different sizing but it's the same thing. I don't have it right in front of the
me, but I'll have Lee get it to you. But it's moving down slightly. The interesting part of that, Vivek, honestly is in
the highest average balances, you actually have seen them down from pre-pandemic, which means you saw
them reposition that in the market. So, going to the earlier question, we may have seen a lot of that already take
place. But I think it's been down slightly quarter-over-quarter in that cohort.

Thank all of you. Good quarter to finish 2022, and thank you to our teammates for producing it. We continue to
grow earnings year-over-year. We have good organic growth and operating leverage for the sixth straight quarter.
Those will continue in 2023. The asset quality in the company continues to remain at historic lows relative to any
normalized time period in the company's history, including the strong credit performance we had just leading into
the pandemic.
So, our job is now to drive what we can control, which is the organic growth of the franchise, the investments that
we make are bearing fruit, and also to keep the expenses in good control, and we plan to do that in 2023. Thank
you, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
