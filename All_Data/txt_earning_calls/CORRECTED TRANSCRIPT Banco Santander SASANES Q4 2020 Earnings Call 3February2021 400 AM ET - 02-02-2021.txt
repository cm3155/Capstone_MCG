So, thank you, Sergio, and good morning, everybody. And I want to start by saying that I hope you and your close
ones are safe and well. It's been a difficult year for everybody and all of us have lost colleagues and friends. And

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 03-Feb-2021
Without further ado, again, welcome to our 2020 presentation. We will cover the results for the year. We will give
you our views for the medium-term and cover some of the strategic priorities that we will be focusing on for the
next few years.
[audio gap] (00:01:24-00:02:45)
Sorry. Cost of credit at 1.28% and slightly better than the improved guidance that we gave last quarter. And
finally, we have continued to generate very strong growth in organic capital, reached 12.34% at the end of the
year which is above our target range. We, in November 2020, paid a dividend new shares equivalent to €0.10 per
share and the board of directors' intention is to go back to the 40% to 50% as soon as we can. We are also
proposing to our shareholders in the end of March, a €0.0275 per share in cash against 2020 results.
José Antonio will review that in more detail, the full-year results. But just to point out, again, that we delivered a €5
billion underlying profit that suffered a 50% increase in provisions due to COVID with very good cost control as
you can see and net operating income in constant euros, as I mentioned, which is up year-on-year. Again, these
underlying results and provisions represent a prudent approach to the COVID-related potential losses, which we
have been guiding through the year.
At the base of these strong underlying numbers is again our geographical and business diversification. It has
shown its worth in previous crises, again in this one. We have delivered robust performance in the Americas. I
want to point out that North America has been our best-performing region, the best order and profit performance
in 2020 with growth in loyal customers based on increased collaboration between Mexico and the US.
Importantly, in the US, we delivered $1.2 billion net profit. That's the statutory attributable profit and a growth in
the underlying profit for the year.
Europe, we are very much focused on transforming the business. What we call One Europe is a new operating
model. We're very confident this will lead us to results that will be increasingly positive. We are basing our growth
in revenues at an increasing productivity. And importantly, we have generated €1 billion net cost savings
excluding perimeter in the last two years.
And South America remains the growth engine for the group. We have delivered 19% ROTE, but very importantly,
operating income increased 5% on a year-on-year basis in Brazil and loyal customers and customer loans grew at
9% and 15%. And finally, we're also increasingly diversified by businesses. You can see here CIB very strong
numbers, Wealth Management also, and our Digital Consumer Bank, which is the pro forma merger of Santander
Consumer Europe and Openbank which is already 16% of the total revenues.
I mentioned at the beginning that COVID has been a challenge for all of us at the personal level. We are very
clear that our priority throughout and continues to be our people. This is the best way that we can take care of our
customers. We have supported 6 million of our customers with moratoria, lending €1 billion per day to SMEs and
corporates. We have also supported our communities in a very important way with €100 million across the group
in aid in different aspects and this is something which we are very keen because we know that that is at the base
of our success for the future.
We are also during 2020 very focused on further embedding ESG across the bank. It's something which is at the
base again of our aim and I define it as being a more responsible bank. We have continued supporting our
customers in a transition to green. This is something which we are absolutely very focused on, €32.6 billion in
green financing as you can see since 2019 and going green ourselves.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 03-Feb-2021
So in 2020, we were net zero in our own operations and this is something we will continue going forward. We are
promoting financial inclusion especially in the Americas. We supported about €500 million credit to
microentrepreneurs and also supporting society through scholarships and our support for universities. Very
importantly, we have continued to invest in our talent and also diversity. We are aiming to continue in this line. We
are now close to 24% of women in leadership positions, a very diverse board in terms of nationalities,
backgrounds with 40% women on the group board. And again at the base of all of our strategy is a increasingly
strong culture, which we have defined as being simple, personal, and fair. So, after this introduction, I will pass it
over to José Antonio to give you a summary of both the group and the businesses in 2020. José Antonio?

[audio gap] (00:08:20-00:09:02)
So, excluding then, total income remained stable as the decrease in activity and lower interest rates were offset
by higher volumes, the lower cost of deposits and good performance in global businesses. We accelerate our cost
reduction and we expect to keep on track in this year. As a result, net operating income in a very difficult year
grew 2% year-on-year in constant euros, higher loan-loss provisions due to the COVID crisis with the cost of
credit in line with our guidance during the year.
All in all, underlying attributable profit reached €5 million as I already mentioned. We had a very positive fourth
quarter. We improved our business activity and customer revenue reached its highest figure in the last eight
quarters.
Finally, we recorded in the year €13.9 billion, a negative net capital gains and provisions, following the €12.6
billion impairment we announced in June. The bank has recorded charges of €1.1 billion in the fourth quarter.
These charges in the fourth quarter were mainly restructuring cost in Spain, but also in other countries in Europe
due to the transformation process we are implementing to increase productivity and efficiency. In Europe, we
expect total restructuring cost in 2020 and 2021 of around €1.5 billion and we expect savings of €1 billion in 2021
and 2022.
Going through the P&L along the main lines of the P&L, Q4 customer revenue continue to consolidate this upward
trend, while trending towards the pre-COVID levels. 4% growth in NII versus Q3, with the highest NII in the last
two years, mainly driven by Spain, UK and South America. Fee income grew 3%, primarily backed by South
America. Costs were up 4% in the quarter, partly affected by seasonality labor agreements in Argentina and Brazil
were – are the main drivers and higher technology expenses particularly in Mexico. As a result, net operating
income decreased 3% quarter-on-quarter, but was 3% higher than in Q4 2019.
Taking a more detailed look at the customer revenue, NII increased from higher lending and deposit volumes,
with more than offset the interest rate impact and negative regulatory impact in Brazil, particularly in Brazil and
Poland. Net fee income was affected by the COVID crisis. In this environment, our strategy remains focused on
increasing customer loyalty and growth in higher value-added services and products. Very positive quarter for CIB
and Wealth Management & Insurance. Together, they represent 50% of the fee income of the bank.
In costs, you see the trends. The figures speak by themselves. In Europe, 6% decrease; in North America, 2%
down, mainly in the US, 5% down; in South America, cost increased 1% excluding Argentina due to the high
inflation. We expect to continue to reducing costs and improving our efficiency ratio in 2021.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 03-Feb-2021
Going to the cost of credit. The cost of credit stood in line with our expectations. Ana already mentioned the
1.28%, increasing the year due to expected higher – expected macro scenario. The increase largely reflects the
IFRS 9 forward-looking view based on potential macroeconomic scenarios and collective and individual
assessment to cover respected credit losses in these scenarios. However, the underlying trends in credit quality
remain solid in 2020. NPL decreased 11 basis points. Coverage increased 8 percentage points. Loan-loss
reserves increased €4 billion to more than €24 billion.
By stage, we increased the stage 1 €22 billion due to the increase in the loan book, stage 2, € 21 billion, and the
stage 3 remaining [indiscernible] (00:13:15). This classification speaks about the underlying quality trends in the
loan book.
When it comes to moratoria sampling, we've got a – we were very proactive in the moratoria. Some of them were
offered by the bank to the customers, some of them were mandatory by the different government. At some point,
we have €112 billion in moratoria. So, the majority of this has expired and used just 3% of the expired moratoria
are classified as stage 3. 78% of the active moratoria remain secured and 83% is concentrated in Europe, mainly
in Portugal and in Spain. In Portugal, government-mandated extension of our moratoria until September. And in
Spain, longer initial terms than other countries, almost 95% of the one you have in the scheme expire in the
coming month, although yesterday, the Spanish government took some actions to extend some moratoria for a
specific sector having vulnerable people.
When it comes to capital, the capital ratio reached 12.3% after increasing 36% (sic) [36 basis points] in the
quarter and 69 basis points in the year. The 104 basis points of organic generation partly offset by the impact of
restructuring cost, corporate transactions and market performance. It also includes 9 basis points related to an
accrual of 2020 dividend payments based on the limits established by the ECB that allows a maximum payment
of €0.0275 per share. The fully-loaded Core Equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.89%. Tangible net asset value was €3.79,
virtually stable since September, although we took some restructuring cost charges as you had seen in the P&L.
Going to the regions and making some comments about the three regions and the main countries, with the
creation of One Europe, we are accelerating our business transformation to achieve with two main goals; achieve
superior growth and having a more efficient operating model. Regarding commercial activity, loans grew 4%
boosted by SME and large corporation in Spain, mortgages in UK and CIB. Portugal rose loan book 8%. Deposit
increased 6% and mutual funds, 5%. This growth is remarkable in Europe.
Moving to results, underlying attributable profit amounted to €2.7 billion in 2020, 45% less than in 2019, affected
by higher loan loss provisions in all markets. So, other points I want to mention is the cost decreases well ahead
of our schedule [ph] where (00:16:10) I comment before. The total income net interest income remained flat but
improving the later part of the year, partly driven by the recovery in commercial activity and consumer lending and
improvement in the cost of funding.
Before going to more detail into Santander Spain and UK, I would like to highlight Santander Consumer Finance
for positive performance in the year, clearly outperforming the market, showing high resilience in results and
recovery in the second half of the year. In Q4, profit increased 14% compared with an already strong Q3. This is a
business that clearly reflects the benefits of the diversification. Ana will describe later our price in [ph] the Italian
Consumer Bank (00:16:51) in more detail.
In Spain, we have been very active in supporting our customers, been very active with ICO funding where we
granted €31 billion. Since the state of alarm was declared, we have granted €100 billion to self-employed people

on corporates. We made further progress in enhancing customer experience. We are escalating in Net Promoter
Score in relation with our competitors.
The volumes grew – loans grew 5%, and customer funds 4%. In the net – in the income statement, the profit for
the year was €517 million, 60% (sic) [67%] lower year-on-year. By line, the income fell basically due to the lower
fee income in relation with the lockdowns we have had. And also the reduced income from real estates and
smaller ALCO performance.
[ph] Comparison (00:17:50) net interest income grew 1% driven by the positive performance in volumes, margin
management, and the positive contribution for TLTROs. We had another positive year in cost dropping 10%.
Lastly, loan-loss provisions doubled driven by the expected potential losses in our macro scenario arising from the
pandemic and several collective assessments in the most vulnerable sectors. That say, our portfolio's credit
quality remain solid. NPL decreased 71 basis points. [indiscernible] (00:18:24) remain at lower levels than pre-
COVID provided the different support programs in place. [indiscernible] (00:18:30) €1.8 billion in December
versus €3.7 billion in February. Coverage increased 6 percentage points. Loan-loss reserves increased by €1
billion and the different stages, stage 1 grew €16 billion, stage 2, €3 billion and stage 3, a little bit less than €1
billion.
Going to UK, our transformation program is gaining traction and beginning to show results. Volumes increased
year-on-year, loans, plus 3%, customer funds, plus 8%. 2020 profit cannot [ph] be overweigh (00:19:05) was
heavily affected by COVID-19 and regulatory changes particularly in relation with overdrafts with one offset by
better NII plus 2% and lower cost, minus 6%. Profit fell year-on-year but increase 18% quarter-on-quarter
continuing the recovery that began in Q3, thanks to the NII – that increase NII due to the increase in the NIM by
11 basis points in the quarter due to lower funding cost [indiscernible] (00:19:38) book margin.
Costs improves 3%, minus 6% year-on-year. Loan-loss provisions have started to normalize in the year. Cost of
risk is relatively low, 28 basis points. Coverage increased by 11 percentage points. In constant euros, stage 2
increased by €6 billion and stage 3, plus €600 million. For 2021, we expect good operating performance based on
our funding cost and new business margins, improved productivity through our transformation product.
In North America, it's the region that has, we believe, the best ordinary profit performance across the group in
2020. [indiscernible] (00:20:19) plus 4%, and customer funds, plus 19%. Profit just – decreased just 3% despite
the pandemic related provisions driven by net operating income. Efficiency improved significantly.
By country, Santander US focused on preserving the strength of its balance sheet and its sustained improvement
in profitability. Volume loans grew 6% and deposits grew 20%. Profit increased 4% year-on-year with a resilient
NII, cost reduction minus 5% and lower minority interest in SC USA. NPL ratio fell 16 basis points with reinforced
coverage plus 50 percentage points to 210%. In constant euros, stage 2 increased €3 billion and stage 3
remained flat.
In Mexico, the loan book remained flat [indiscernible] (00:21:11) middle of the year and normalized afterward.
Customer funds grew 14%, particularly strong growth in demand deposits from individual [ph] and grew (00:21:21)
24%.
Regarding the South, positive trends in revenue and net operating income. [indiscernible] (00:21:27) 5% due to IT
investments. NPL ratio increased, 62 basis points, and the coverage decreased 7 percentage points to 121%. In
constant euros, stage 2 increased by €2 billion, stage 2 remained basically flat grew €200 million.

South America, volumes gradually recovered during the second half of the year. Loans grew 15% year-on-year
and customer funds, 18%. Deposit – particularly strong growth in the deposits, plus 30% in the region. The region
was the main driver of [indiscernible] (00:22:07) of the top line, with higher revenues in all countries.
Net operating income rose 5% as a result of the positive revenue and improving cost to income. Full year 2020
underlying attributable profit fell just 4% due to COVID-related provisions. NPL ratio, 47 basis points, and
coverage increased 9 percentage points.
By country, Brazil recorded an excellent year, I will explain later. In Chile, we are ranked number one in NPS with
a record of growth in current account plus 42%. Full year 2020 net operating income increased 4% boosted by
higher NII and cost control. Argentina, Uruguay, Peru and Colombia achieved higher profits due to positive
performance in revenue and efficiency improvement.
Going to Brazil, Brazil economy performed better, significantly better than expected. Santander has once again
recorded an excellent year both in terms of results and volumes while we remain focused on capturing growth
opportunities. Commercial activity in the second half of the year exceeds pre-COVID-19 levels, boosting revenue
growth in the year and achieving double-digit increases in volumes. Loans grew 19% and customer funds 16%.
Full-year 2020 net operating income increased 3% driven by resilient revenue and efficiency improvement. Higher
volumes offset the significant margin pressures and lower interest rate. Higher provision with net credit quality
indicators at very controlled levels. NPL ratio of [ph] 73 basis points, (00:23:49) coverage increased by 13
percentage points. Underlying attributable profit decreased 5% and return on tangible equity remained high at
19%.
For 2021, we remain optimistic about Brazil, focused on increasing our customer base, maximizing revenues
across our business, and certainly maintaining high profitability levels and volumes growth with a good asset
quality and continue to gain market share in the most important segments in the company.
Taking a look to the global business, Corporate & Investment Banking have excellent year. We continue to
support our customers, increasing our market share. Income grew 15%. Profit was 23% higher driven by 15%
growth in the income we mentioned and 3% cost reduction. We grew double digit in our core business,
particularly in global markets and global debt financing.
In Q4, profit declined as improvement performance – of the improved performance in NII and fee was broadly
offset by lower trading gains due to [ph] CBA (00:25:03) and lower volatility than in the third quarter and higher
provisions related to COVID-19 specific names.
Wealth Management & Insurance, the business performed well in the year. The assets under management
amounted to €370 billion, in line with December 2019 in constant euros. In the quarter growth was 4%. Total fee
income generated – accounted for 31% of the group's total. Underlying attributable was up 2%, thanks to 3%
growth in revenues.
In private banking, positive sales and business growth. Fees grew 9% in Santander Asset Management. And
strong volume rebound from the lows in May and further progresses in our ESG strategy. Lastly in insurance,
underlying profit rose 18%. The main growth driver continued to be noncredit-related business.
And now, I'm turning over to Ana to continue with the presentation.

Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, thank you so much, José Antonio.
Allow me now to say, first of all, again, that I am really proud of the progress we have made since 2014. I am
excited about the opportunities ahead, and I would like to start by saying, again, that our aim and values remained
the same as we've said for several years. They provide very strong foundation for the Santander of Tomorrow
whilst allowing us to develop today. Our aim is to be the best open financial services platform by acting
responsibly and earning the lasting loyalty of all our stakeholders.
Just a few minutes to show you how we have delivered results following the strategy for a number of years.
Again, our team and our approach to capital management and discipline have been key. If we look back to the
last six years, 2014 to 2019, of course, 2020 was the outlier. We have doubled profits, improved [audio gap]
(00:27:08) Sorry, I hadn't put the – if we look back to our performance for the last six years, 2020 was a clear
outlier. I just want to remind ourselves that we have doubled profits, improved our underlying return on tangible
equity by more than 400 basis points, 11.8% in 2019, 12.34% today. Very importantly, and I think these numbers
show the transformation of our model, our capital base has grown by €29 billion, that's a 70% increase, with only
a 13% increase in RWAs. Again, testament to a radical change in the model, which we will continue into the
future, and that's what gives us confidence again for the next few years.
If we look ahead, we will continue following the strategy, which has served us well, allocating resources efficiently,
focusing on the profitable growth, which makes us very different from many of our peers, and, of course,
shareholder value creation. We will continue to grow our RoRWA organically. Again, most of this growth will
continue from our businesses in the Americas.
In terms of segments, we'll continue to invest and expand on our fee-based and capitalized businesses,
Corporate & Investment Banking, Wealth Management, and payments through PagoNxt, and, of course, the
Digital Consumer Bank, which is, as I will explain again in a few minutes, the pro forma merger of Santander
Consumer and Openbank. This should lead us to a growth in earnings per share and tangible NAV per share,
which in turn would underpin cash dividend growth, bringing us to the path of the 40% to 50% cash payout as
soon as regulators allow us.
To capture organic profitable growth, we will continue to invest in the higher return and capitalized geographies
and businesses. We have made progress again in 2020 in accretive capital rebalancing first by [ph] reweighting
(00:29:25) our capital to these more profitable geographies, mainly the Americas, to higher return and capital-light
businesses, CIB, Wealth Management, Insurance, and Payments. We have been setting minimum profitability
thresholds in all segments. Also and very, very important, we have a lot of focus on faster asset rotation, and we
have aligned the top management remuneration with these profitability goals. As a result in 2020, this is an
important number in what has been, again, a difficult year. About 40% of our capital has delivered double-digit
underlying return on tangible equity.
So, as we look to the Santander of Tomorrow, we have three priorities for this profitable growth. There is no doubt
that our industry is going to continue to be challenging even in a post-COVID world; low interest rates, increasing
competition. But we have very clear three strategic priorities to build on our foundations, including the One
Santander, a new operating model; second, PagoNxt; and third, the Digital Consumer Bank. Again, think of this of
further leveraging our scale and using technology to strengthen customers' loyalty, but also to access new fee-
based revenue pools. I will go now through each one of these.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 03-Feb-2021
So, what do we mean when we say One Santander? What we are really saying is that we are aiming to create a
much better bank for our customers to drive growth, to drive profitable growth. We have made huge progress in
the last few years. I just shared with you the numbers of these five years, six years, which showed that. But we
want to accelerate this transformation. We created the regions now with the One Santander. We are redefining
again our operating model. We want to make sure that we can leverage our 147 million customers, and also
based on clear principles.
The first one is simplify. It's the key word here. Simplify our mass market value proposition. Redefine how we
interact with our customers and further leverage the capacity we have across Europe and then across the group
to build together and create a common model to share processes and do this across markets. This is not just in
the One Europe. We're doing that across the Americas. And this is what will allow us to reach top three NPS in
nine countries, over 50% of total sales will be digital, and to further improve our efficiency ratio to about 40%. We
will follow very clear milestones as we execute along these three priorities.
If I turn first to the One Europe, the One Europe goal is to go to 10% to 12% underlying return on tangible equity
and an efficiency ratio of 45%. We will work across all regions, but especially in Europe, to leverage the payments
platform, the PagoNxt global solutions that I have referred to.
In North America, continued focus on collaboration between the two countries. We are seeing 30% increase in
revenues in 2020 in areas like Commercial Banking and CIB, and targeting 11% to 13% return on tangible equity,
and 40% efficiency in the medium term.
South America, we're expanding Getnet and Superdigital to other countries. We did announce yesterday
afternoon in Brazil the listing of Getnet Brazil. I will comment on that later. And our aim is to deliver an underlying
return on tangible equity of 19% to 21% compared to the 18% for the region this year, and 35% efficiency.
So, allow me to turn to the second priority, which is PagoNxt. PagoNxt is a global payments company where we're
bringing together different assets across the group. Initially, it's going to focus very much on two segments, first is
the merchant acquiring and second the SMEs, but will also be looking to the consumer segment. Payments is not
a new strategy, it's not a new priority. Payments has always been at the core of our loyalty strategy, and this is
what allows us to earn the loyalty of our customers.
Santander has the scale to become one of the top global payment platforms in the world. Merchant acquiring is a
global revenue pool of €80 billion. It's a fast-growing market, especially on the e-commerce globally growing at
11%. International trade again, global revenue pool of €350 billion also growing globally. We already have
significant scale in these businesses. So, we have a very strong starting point. In merchant acquiring, for
example, we have more than a million active merchants and business customers and 60 million active credit and
debit. In trade, we will leverage our more than 4 million SME customers, this is probably one of the biggest in the
banking world, and over 200,000 SMEs that are trading internationally.
Think of PagoNxt as the backbone, the technology backbone that will allow our banks, the One Santander, to
leverage our scale. To really have 147 million customers in one place with common products, this is what
PagoNxt is aiming for, and to build those products that are essential to our customers, most important to our
customers, will allow us to grow faster, but very importantly to deliver a better customer experience. The aim is
that this will be a single autonomous company and will probably be one of the largest private fintech companies in
the world. Again, we announced yesterday the listing during 2021 of Getnet Brazil, so you can have much better
visibility about all these revenues that are high-growth revenues inside our business.

So, I already mentioned focus on merchant and trade solutions. I just want to point out here that this is not starting
from scratch. And these are just two examples where we are building our own software, our own solutions, and
this is Brazil and Spain where, as you can see here, market share growing from 12% to 15% in Brazil. In Spain,
from 12% to 17% growing at 40% where we also bought back our acquiring stake from Elavon. So again, we
believe we can build better solutions ourselves. We have the scale and we have proven it works. We are now
going to bring all of these together, and we will bring together Getnet Brazil with our Getnet Global Platform with
Wirecard, [ph] with SEMS (00:36:58) in a single company for acquiring.
Our vision on the trade side is to deliver fast and efficient trade finance, supply-chain, and FX payments. Again,
this is not starting from scratch. We've made significant investments and progress. We already have 300,000
customers onboarded into what is a global platform, and Ebury is at the heart of this trade strategy. Ebury has
generated more than £100 million in net revenues, 270,000 transactions. Even in a challenging environment, they
have grown the number of transactions per customer and growing about 3% on the year.
Another of the key assets for trade is the Payments Hub. Again, this is an internal development. It went live and
became the main SEPA provider for Ebury last quarter. In December 2020, our Payments Hub processed over
€30 million in incoming payments. We've reached agreement to become the main payments engine for all our
corporate bank in London, Paris, Milan, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, and New York. It is already servicing third parties
outside Santander.
And finally, Mercury is the platform that has allowed us to finance €6.6 million of which 60% of the trades were
done digitally. Again, more than 7,000 customers have already been onboarded. And just interesting fact is that in
2020, many of these imports were related to medical supplies.
So, the third priority the way Santander is going to become an open financial services platform, how we're going
to grow and every time and I'm sure I'll get a question from you in terms of are we going to do M&A. Well, we do
not need to do banking M&A. We aim to grow in new markets through our Digital Consumer Bank. This is the pro
forma merger of Santander Consumer in Europe and Openbank. Openbank is the first European bank running
fully on the cloud approved end-to-end by the ECB. We are very confident that this is a strategy that will deliver
great results. The reason for that is that Openbank includes already very successful strategy in terms of cross-
selling. But, as you can see here, we are going to merge that with a very significant consumer operation. So,
Santander Consumer brings 55,000 merchant POS, Openbank 1.2 million customers, 6 million new consumers
per year in 15 markets in the case of Santander Consumer, and also the Santander Auto where we are servicing
75,000 dealers and with a very high quality and growth franchise.
We are aiming that the Digital Consumer Bank will run on a digital banking API model, a SaaS model, and this is
crucial as it will allow us to fully leverage the data for both sides of the business and generate growth, but also
fundamentally change the way we operate our Consumer business. This would lead and this is the ambition to
grow revenues and double PAT in the medium-term reaching 15% underlying return on tangible. This is
something which will take a few years, but it's really a new paradigm. We will be using common apps, single
streamlined operating model, simplified license. We have already started on this as we launched Openbank in
Germany, Holland, and Portugal, and a very different way of running the business. It will enable new auto
consumer lending, but also new products to the consumer customers.
I want to point out and José Antonio gave some facts, Santander Consumer Finance in 2020, and this goes back
to the diversification, delivered 3% revenue growth in a very challenging year, 12.5% underlying return on tangible
in 2020. As I said, our ambition is now bigger. We aim for 39% efficiency and 15% underlying returns.

We have painted this as a flywheel because I think this is the best way to picture how the combination of these
two businesses is going to really power growth. It's a virtuous circle. And if you start what we have built over the
years, our significant customer base at the top through 23,000 merchants, they offer consumer financing at
checkout to customers. Merchants go from large to small across industries. Many started as an offline but now
are adding online capabilities. And, of course, we have a very fast growth in online-only businesses.
This generates about 4.5 million contracts. We actually already have 700,000 digital customers, and we're now
expanding to other sectors such as telecom and education. These new digital customers are our target for other
lending products, insurance. We believe there's significant growth opportunity for both our lending and our digital
banking services. And, of course, this gives us significant data at the point of the first transaction, which gives us
very valuable insights into these customers' current and future financial needs.
Then these new customers are candidates for other banking products through Openbank. These are one-click
sign-ups even for a loan, one click. New current account customers of course generate new deposits. These are
loyalty strategy, provide in turn low funding for lending.
I mentioned already that our digital bank averages 4.5 products per customer. But let me say also that in 2020 we
grew by more than 100% new customers year-on-year. Again, the API services in turn attract new merchants, in
turn add new customers. Again, the flywheel spins creating data depth and insights and of course revenue
growth.
So, just to end, wanted to reiterate that based on the latest IMF/OECD outlook, our goals are cost income ratio
below 47% for 2021, cost of credit trending downwards from 1.28%, 9% to 10% underlying return on tangible; for
the medium term, mid-single-digit revenue growth in constant euros, best-in-class NPS. Again, this is the goal for
the new operational model. And we want to reiterate the following goals that we communicated in 2019 of 13% to
15% underlying return on tangible equity, 11% to 12% CET1, and the board's intention to restore the payout of
40% to 50% on underlying.
So, in summary, we have delivered in 2020, again, strong underlying results that show the resiliency of our model.
Diversification again has proved that it has value, it has delivered robust performance in the Americas, solid
growth in our global businesses, providing balance against a more challenging environment in Europe, robust
credit quality deteriorating by just 28 basis points, thanks to active risk management. We have continued to build
organic capital reaching to 12.34% above our target. We have a strong capital position. We are comfortable with
these current capital levels and buffers, and especially we are well placed to continue allocating capital through
the internal significant opportunities for profitable growth to create value. And we have a clear strategy going
forward for 2021 that I've just reviewed, which gives us a high degree of confidence that we will deliver on our
medium-term goals.
So, thank you again very much, and we are now available for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, the Q&A session starts now. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. The first question comes from Jernej Omahen from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jernej Omahen Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs
Yes. First of all, good morning from my side. I'm just going to ask two questions, please. The first one is on the
return on tangible equity target and how that could translate into tangible book value per share growth. I guess
we've seen Santander records, considering the circumstances, high levels of underlying profitability, but the
tangible book value per share went backwards this year for reasons that we're all familiar with. I mean, what gives
you the confidence that if you meet the target that you've set yourself for this year that they will translate into
tangible book value per share growth as well?
And then the second question I have is on the EBA stress tests, they've announced the underlying assumptions
for these tests, and some of them seemed to be very, very severe. I mean, just forecasting a perpetual recession
pretty much. And I was wondering to what extent, if at all, do you expect the results of the tests to drive the
supervisory decisions around capital return, dividends, buybacks, et cetera? Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, thank you so much. So, this year tangible NAV, as you've seen and you said it, has been very affected by
exchange rates. We are working very hard on continuing and accelerating the change in the model, which we
have really done a lot of that in the last five, six years. At the end, it's about reallocating capital to profitable
growth, first; second, ensuring diversification. US has given us a very good return in dollars, so we need to ensure
a proper balance between higher volatility currencies and the more, let's say, stable currencies like the dollar and
the euro. I say this, maybe the pound also.
So, that is really the main way we are planning to improve the tangible NAV, continuous capital reallocation to the
higher growth and profitability, ensuring the balance and diversification through the cycle.
If we look at the 13% to 15% medium-term target, I can say, first, it's based on revenue growth. So, we are saying
mid-single-digit revenue growth as the basis of that. If we look at the shorter term in terms of 2021, we're looking
to volume growth based on volumes especially in the Americas. We are looking at positive assets repricing. We
are looking at delivering half of the €1 billion, so €500 million additional reduction in cost in Europe and the cost of
credit that trend downwards. So, again, really doing everything we've done this year, but just doing it a bit more
and a bit better for 2021. And for the medium term, focusing on these three priorities, this year we have already
seen, I think José Antonio mentioned that, it's not just the Corporate & Investment Bank and Wealth Management,
which are now close to 40%. Again, these are higher, let's say, higher return on capital businesses, but acquiring
on payments through PagoNxt should also help us a lot on this change in the model.
On the EBA stress test, yeah, there are some issues there that maybe José Antonio wants to comment. However,
we feel that our capital buffers and our diversification, the fact that our pre-provision profit this year, which is
around €24 billion, we could double provisions of 2020 and still not eat into capital. The buffers we have even
after that of €17 billion, €18 billion, all of that gives us confidence that whatever happens with the stress test, I

don't know if you're going to give some details on – there are some issues in the stress test that mean that we
might be penalized, but I don't know how you want to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Well, as you know, Jernej, in the stress test we've been performing very well. We were a top performer there. Our
capital depletion was lower than our conservation buffer, and, well, we have a P2G on top of this, yeah. So, we
expect to continue to perform well there, although the synergies are more severe. And there are two issues that
we've been raising over time that particularly affect emerging market exposure like our case. That is the static
balance sheet that is probably, as you know, in emerging markets, loan books particularly are very short run and
in one year you renew the whole balance sheet, but it is what it is.
And the second one that is new, somehow new is the provisions on the emerging markets are not allowed to
depreciate with the depreciation of the currency that while technically speaking is not very natural but it is what it
is. Having said that, we continue to expect during our diversification and the resilience of our business model, and
the stronger, we have the stronger pre-provision profit in the industry and we continue to perform well on our
capital depletion being among the lowest in the industry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. If I may add just another for context, we have had in 10 years probably two of the biggest global crises that
have happened in decades. And just to understand the stability in our model, if we look at our performance in
underlying profit in 2020, about €5 billion, that's more than double what we had at the low point in 2008 and in
2013 – in the 2008 crisis. Again, it shows that we've made a lot of progress, and, of course, this with 70% more
capital than we had then. So, again, the stability in our earnings diversification and how we perform on the stress I
think is evident from what we have done in two global crises so far.

Ignacio Ulargui Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I just have two questions and one is on the fee
strategy, and just wanted to get a bit of your thoughts on how do you see this sort of like new business additions
on Payment, Wealth Management, or Investment Banking tools to be [ph] having to make (00:53:08) a bit more
dynamic performance on fees. So, I mean, I do see a very clear tailwind from the bit of the unwinding of the 1|2|3
strategy in terms of funding costs. And that is being very visible in NII in the UK and also in Spain. So, I mean, just
wanted to get a bit of your thoughts on how do you see fees into the next couple of years. And I mean what is the
relevance of the payments business on that process?
And also, second question is on the Brazilian business and it has been a very good performance, much better
than what we expected at the beginning of the year in this pandemic. I mean, which levers do you plan to take just
to continue improving the contribution of the country to the group? Thanks.

Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, the growth in fees would continue to come from CIB, Wealth Management. Of course, also Retail is incredibly
important and Insurance. So, the One Europe strategy but also in the Americas, retail fees are also a big driver. It
is clear that there's still uncertainty over the next few months. So, we could have, in the first half, not a great
performance in fees. That's yet something which will depend a lot on the health situation. But what we have seen
is that once and we see that in the second half of the year, that once things open up a bit, the performance is
much better.
On the payments, you will see, again, with the listing of Getnet Brazil, just a flavor of what we can do in this
space. The key thing here is that we already have performed incredibly well in acquiring in Brazil or Spain within a
couple of years of having our own, let's say, payments factory. Once we extend this to other countries, you ask
about the timing, that's always difficult, but I would say a few years. We've said medium term you should see a
very significant increase coming from these areas.
You want to answer on Brazil? I mean, Brazil – I think it's every time Brazil or we have a crisis, there's always
uncertainty as to the performance, but it actually has done a very good job. And again, remember that Brazil has
historically low rates, so we now have a bit steeper interest rate curve, which is also positive. And we are looking
to growth in volumes and positive assets repricing for, I think I said that already, for 2021, and cost of risk trending
downward in general in all our geographies once more than others and there could be variations there. But I think
that's really the picture for Brazil. And, of course, the lower rates mean that that helps customers for payments
and good performance, I think, as they exit moratoriums.
Is that roughly...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. It's basically we rely on volumes. We expect to keep growing double-digit in Brazil as we did in 2020. So,
this is probably the main lever. Margins more stable than the ones we had in 2020. In 2020, remember that we
have the regulatory impact of what they call their personal check. That is kind of [ph] overdraft (00:56:19) that
affected significantly their NIM and NII. And, well, at the end, the driver is market share gains and our capacity to
keep growing the number of customers. And you see the number of customers in the country had been booming
in the last 4, 5 years yeah. So, we are still there. And I already mentioned Getnet [indiscernible] (00:56:38) Getnet
is an example. We can go to auto finance where our market share is 25%. You can go to agro business where
we've gone from 2% market share to 9% market share, and we keep accounting in corporate world. Our cost of
risk went down and in CIB, we're a market leader. So, well, the franchise has a very good momentum and we
expect to continue these trends, yeah.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 03-Feb-2021
Yeah. Hi. Good morning and thank you for the presentation. Two questions from me. The first one, if you can
clarify or give us some colors around regulatory headwinds on capital in 2021 and 2022. And the second question
is on the US business. Obviously, the cost of risk performance has been very positive in the year and much lower
than could be anticipated probably at the beginning of the year. There's a new stimulus plan coming with probably
the possibility of cash and checks actually being handed again to customers. Do we have to still expect an
increase of provisions in SC USA in particular or do you think the level of provisions in 2020 is sustainable for the
future? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, let me answer the US and then I'll pass over to you, José Antonio. So, in terms of the US, we've been
reviewing this in line with the peers that have presented results. We're very much aligned with our peers regional
and even the large banks. If we compare likes-for-likes in term of portfolios, we believe we're being prudent
provisioning. So, I would expect that to continue into 2021.
The stimulus is going to be obviously very important for this. And so, there is really nothing there, which should be
out of line with the rest of our peers, again, if you compare portfolios of the same type of segments. I mean, some
of the larger banks have more C&I than we do, and that's why you've seen some reversals. That is not the case
for us. And in terms of the consumer lender, again, we're in the range of our peers but it has performed very well.
We believe that will continue to be the case until 2021.
In terms of – do you want to answer the other question?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. In terms of capital regulatory headwinds in 2020, we were – the impact of the different regulatory changes
were around [ph] relatively (00:59:10) above 40 basis points. In 2021, you mentioned 2021 and 2022, well, in
2021 that they have more visibility, we are still continuing to see some impacts coming from basically all the TRIM
review of the models, low-default portfolios, all these issues that probably will come, difficult to say always when
you face this. But we expect to be lower the impact than the one we had in 2020 that I remember was [ph]
relatively above 40 basis points. (00:59:45).
And in 2022, well, probably the trend is downward. Clearly, we spent [indiscernible] (00:59:55) TRIM goes and all
the review of the models and all these things we will capture significant risk-weighted asset reduction in some
models that we are building.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes and thank you for taking my questions. And first one, I wonder if you can comment a bit more on the Getnet
listing in Brazil, if you plan to off-load more assets from PagoNxt into this unit, and what are your ambitions with
this listing if you plan to eventually monetize this asset or not?

And second question is a follow-up on the US business. So, you mentioned operationally. I wonder if you can
update strategically your views about the US retail business. I have also seen that you have front-loaded some
restructuring expenses, if you can also comment on these cost-cutting plans here. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, at the moment we have just announced the listing of Getnet Brazil. This is not selling of shares. It's just a
listing of Getnet Brazil. We are, as I explained on PagoNxt, we'll be giving more information during the course of
2021. The goal is that PagoNxt include three types of businesses but really mainly two. One is acquiring business
where we will be bringing together Getnet Brazil with Getnet global platform and eventually Wirecard, which we
closed just a few days ago, and [ph] SEMS (01:01:39). So, that would be a global merchant acquirer eventually,
but Getnet it's about a listing.
In terms of the trade, it's also going to be part of PagoNxt. So, there we have Ebury, Mercury, the Payments Hub,
and probably other products related to trade. So, we have all of that in the global platform. We believe that is a
very interesting business. It's a high-growth business in payments-related activities. In some cases, we have
already given service to third parties like in the Payments Hub. So, that is really the goal with PagoNxt and
Getnet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Well, the second question about the US strategy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Yeah, the US...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
And I may take the cost-cutting in the US.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
We're going to continue to naturally to track, to improve efficiency in the US. Well, we have two angles there.
There are probably – there is more efficiency gains to make in the bank while SC USA is growing and probably
the cost will go up. Overall, in the US, I will say the costs going forward will be quite flattish, yeah, in the whole US
but not specific restructuring cost in the way we are doing in Europe. No, this is not in our vision for – in our plans
for 2021.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 03-Feb-2021
Yeah. In terms of the strategic view of the US, first is that the US market is the best risk-return market probably in
the world aside from being large and a source of talent and innovation, institutional stability, their strong and
increasing connections not just to LatAm but to Europe. And what's very important is that both Santander
Consumer and SBNA are working increasingly together. A lot of the origination in Santander Consumer is
financed by SBNA. So, we look at the US as a country not as pieces of a different business.
This is not different, by the way, to what we do in Brazil or Europe. And, again, this year, we have had some
positive one-offs. But even in constant currency, we have had an increase in profits from the US. And the
adjusted returns, once we adjust for excess capital, which will not be there forever, actually are at or even a bit
above the cost of equity, depending how you see that of 8.5%. So, there are no plans to sell the business. And we
are working, as in the One Europe, with increasing connectivity, not just in terms of working with customers
across different Santander countries – again, I think I mentioned in Corporate & Investment Bank and
Commercial, we are seeing 30% increases year-on-year – but also in building together.
And so, this is incredibly important. It was not an option a few years ago. Today, you can leverage the same way
you can build for Poland, UK, and Spain. You can build for Mexico, US, and eventually why not Brazil or Europe.
So, this is really the very different approach to the management of the business, which is what we are calling the
One Santander new operating model. So, again, we are very focused on growing in a profitable way and building
on the foundations of the last few years.

Operator: The next question comes from Carlos Cobo from Société Générale. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos Cobo Catena Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (Spain)
Hello. Thank you very much for the presentation and the extra detail on your vision for the future. Going a little bit
back to the numbers of the quarter, could you touch on the regulatory impacts for 2021 again? Sorry to insist.
Have you said below the 40 basis points in 2020? The last guidance that I had was an impact of 10 to 15 basis
points in 2021. Are you still comfortable with that or there is some room for slightly higher impact just to fine-tune
the model?
And then two quick questions, a more strategic. If payments is a global business and that's how you present it,
why listing the Brazilian subsidiary just for me to understand why starting that? Why not being more global in the
listing?
And the second question will be on COVID losses. Could you try to help us to gain a little bit more confidence on
what's the vision or the outlook for 2022? What's the scenario of the default study you've covered for 2022
because without the regulatory forbearance and the support from the [indiscernible] (01:06:35) rolling over the
grace periods from capital amortization and on the restructuring of credits, we don't really have any visibility. It
doesn't feel like 2021 is the year to see the big increase in NPL. So, what's the scenario that you have for 2022
where we should assume further progress in the cost of risk reduction? What's the percentage of total, say, stage
2 loans you start to default and how much of that has been covered already? Thank you very much.

Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, I will take the strategic ones and then I will – you can answer the capital and the COVID. But in terms of the
Getnet listing in Brazil, this is the first step. The reason for that is exactly that what you said was the goal is to
create a global platform which would be, let's say, parallel to the banks. So, think about the One Santander, the
bank says, owning customer relationships. Think about PagoNxt as a global platform for acquiring which provides
the backbone, let's say, product factory for payment. This is really how we think about it. And so, this is just the
first step to create that global acquiring platform, which would allow us to add value to not just do payments. Our
vision is that payments will happen. We will not actually do payments, but they will be the cornerstone of value-
added services.
So, again, it's not about a processing business. It's about a value-added services business to our customers built,
of course, on the – eventually on the processing. But it's more than that. And to do that, we actually need to have
it all together outside our listed banks but also outside our non-listed banks. I hope that answers the question.
We are – we will be giving more information and adding to this during 2021 and a lot more a year from now.
Again, these are assets we have been building individually for the last five years. We have shown they work and
now we want to make sure we take it to the next level. We have been rightly so challenged by investors and
analysts, you guys.
Why do you not work better across countries? Well, we have done that in CIB, in Wealth Management. We are
now going to do that for mass market and SMEs. So think of PagoNxt and our payments businesses as providing
a global platform where we can truly leverage the 147 million customers that we have in retail, that we have in
SMEs, 4 million of them that we have in merchants. And again, we'll provide further clarity but this is really the
vision.
So, I think the second question was again on the regulatory headwinds, I believe, for 2021 and COVID losses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. The first one, 2021, well, I already elaborated on the regulatory capital impacting 2021 that we expect to be
lower than the one in 2020. The main impact comes from the [indiscernible] (01:09:40) from the models. And,
well, we expect like two stages there. The first stage is to go up and to have an impact in 2021, and the second
stage, once we get [ph] more than what's (01:09:53) approved, remember that we still have significant amount of
our portfolio under standard models, some of our models, our risk weighting is higher than our competitors and at
some point we will converge with this in the medium-term. So in the short run, the numbers I gave you is lower
impact than in 2020. In the medium-term, we expect some positives from this side. Probably to split this, IR can
talk to you in the small numbers and in more detail on this.
On the COVID losses, if I understood you well, you're asking about 2022. Okay. So, we guide you in 2021 to –
this is an area – naturally, this is an area of uncertainty and everything is based on models. We still have the
health crisis going on. What do we expect? We say, as Ana mentioned before, we are working with kind of IMF
[indiscernible] (01:10:48). So with this scenario, we expect this year the cost of risk to go down from the 1.28% we
had and start the convergence towards the 1%.
In 2022, I don't have any reason to think if we were right in anticipating our [indiscernible] (01:11:07) in the IFRS 9
forward-looking, we build €4 billion of capital provisions that till now are in our balance sheet that we expect this to

cover the majority, if not all, the losses that arise from this. Can we be wrong in the scenario? Maybe, maybe
more negative or more positive. But we are relatively comfortable with this and we – even in the quarter, we [ph]
didn't review (01:11:34) our scenarios, our portfolios, building provisions accordingly with conservative and
prudent approach. And I do think from the 1.28% I will bet on reducing in 2021 and reducing again in 2022. So
this will be my initial expectation.

Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley
Hello. Good morning. I've got a couple of questions I guess on capital allocation. The first one, hopefully, the
capital build journey is now over. When I think about going forward, it sounds like – clearly, the emphasis of
growth is still Americas, but it sounds like it would be a bit more balanced than previously. If I think about the
PagoNxt, the digital and the consumer bank initiatives, obviously Getnet was a tremendous success because
basically, you returned back to your natural market share. With the acquisitions like Wirecard in Germany and the
push to become a global payments platform, how should we think about you achieving sort of growth outside your
natural footprint? What gives you that confidence?
And second on Openbank and Consumer Bank, you're aiming to double profits, I think it is, which is quite – I
mean, it feels ambitious. Maybe you can talk us through which regions do you expect to grow most? And again, if
some of it is outside your natural sort of footprint like Germany although you've got the consumer bank there
clearly, but what are the growth sources where in the regions there?
And the second question also is more sector level is around – obviously the sector, the inability to distribute is
accumulating capital not just for you but across Europe and I would love to hear your thoughts and do you think
this is going to have long lasting effects in terms of competition? Do you think it can trigger sort of M&A and even
cross-border M&A? And in that sort of sense, I've heard you loud and clear several times that you don't need to
do M&A but what would it take for Santander to be open to cross-border M&A or M&A in general? What would
you be looking for? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So you have heard me say and I will repeat loud and clear, we're not interested in cross-border M&A in Europe.
We need further significant changes on the regulatory side took for that to begin to be something we might look
at. We are, and as you've seen in the last month, we are much more active on the digital and payment side. We
believe that we already have enough customers, enough scale. There's a lot of talk about scale. You need scale.
We have achieved 47% cost income. We're guiding to even lower than that in the next few years. Because we do
have scale, we are the number one bank, and I say number one bank across Europe and the Americas in terms
of number of customers. This is the scale that matters.
Second, our revenues with stable revenues in a year like 2020, I think that is remarkable. And so, that is the scale
we are aiming for. We have guided to single – sorry – mid-single digit revenue growth for the medium term even
in 2021. And again, there's lots of uncertainty in the first few months and that could affect our revenues in the first

few months especially on fees. But we feel confident that after what we've done in 2020, that we have the scale to
drive revenues and we have the scale to drive with PagoNxt, with the Digital Consumer Bank to drive profitable
growth. So, again, not planning to – at M&A – cross-border M&A but rather looking at additional digital
opportunities.
In terms of doubling the profit on the Digital Consumer Bank, that is going to be driven a lot by revenues, i.e., 18
million active customers in Santander Consumer Europe, 6 million new consumer customers every year. I
encourage you to look at the flywheel. And again any questions, please very happy to – if you come back to us.
But this is very important because we have the data, we have the customers, and now we have a go-to model
which I don't think any of our peers have which is the Openbank.
So, think of Openbank as giving us the know-how to offer new banking products to customers that we don't need
to invest to acquire because we're already acquiring them, by the way, profitably on the consumer side. This is
crucially important. This is a virtuous circle that I described in the flywheel and that's what gives us confidence
that we can do that. Now, it's going to take a few years so it's not going to be in 2021 or 2022. But three, four
years down the road, what you're going to see is a change in the paradigm in terms of how we run our consumer
business and how that consumer business that is there, it's real, it's over €1 billion in profits, I believe, this year in
2020.
Lots of customers and the Openbank tech stack, which is modern, runs fully on the cloud. And it's not just about
the customer experience, it's also about how we run the business in all the support functions. We can expand to
Holland. We can expand to Germany with very limited cost increases actually in all these support functions in a
way that is very prudent and under control. So, that's the reason we are again not putting a date on this but you
should be seeing in the next few years.
And finally on PagoNxt and the acquisitions, so it should all come together. Again, it will take a few years because
there are several assets across Europe and the Americas. And the goal there again is to increase growth. And the
way we're looking to do that is by value-added services and payments by delivering, for example for SMEs, a
much better cross-border experience for SMEs that trade at a higher growth SMEs. We have 200,000 of those.
We are already testing for example with Ebury. We have a great partnership with Ebury. We're able to offer
services we were not offering before and vice versa. We are helping Ebury, for example, to run the business in
the way we run it in some areas, which is very important these days. So we think that it's a win-win combination
and that's where we will be looking to integrate so we can grow faster.

Daragh Quinn Q
Analyst, KBW
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. It's Daragh from KBW. One question just on the capital targets
and dividends. You've generated capital this year and headed back towards your targets. Presumably even if we
forecast your cash dividend, you would still be looking to generate capital organically. Could you just say, maybe
how that would change your natural outlook for the level of capital you think you should be holding in the future?

And then on the dividend, can you just confirm that there won't be – that you're not planning any scrip dividends in
the future because obviously that has been one of the headwinds in the past to NAV per share growth.
And on the business side of things, maybe just if you could give a quick comment on the margin in two
geographies, one in the UK which you've seen quite a strong improvement in margin and NII over the last couple
of quarters as you've changed the pricing policy on the [ph] 1,2,3 (01:20:10) accounts. If you could just comment
on where things go from here and the outlook for 2021 in the UK. And on the US excluding the consumer
business, it looks like there's just been very ongoing weak margin NII performance from the banking business.
Maybe if you could just provide a little bit of color of what's going on there and what your outlook is? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, on capital, our targets are to be between 11% and 12%. There is, we believe, going forward we're going to
have more capital flexibility, as you've sort of hinted that. We are planning to go back to the 40% to 50% on an
underlying – profit distribution on an underlying basis as soon as we're allowed to do that. And the most important
thing is that even in a difficult year, we have made further progress in what we call the transformation of the
model. It happens at an operating level which is what's driving the financial transformation.
The operational goal, the One Santander new operating model, is actually building, for example, a common
mobile app across Europe, just build once and use across different countries. On a financial level, it means that
we grow our earnings while growing capital but we grow less our balance sheet and lending in proportion to that
growth. And, again, that's what's going to allow us to generate more organic capital and better profitability.
We are not – the scrip is – I know we've gone back in 2020 to a scrip, and again, we need to keep a balance
between institutional investors and also retail and the scrip was the only way we could give some dividend even
though it wasn't shares to our retail. The board and management intention, as we have said many times for the
last six years, is to go to 100% cash. This is what we are intending for 2021. And we will get news on what is the
recommendation from the ECB for European banks in Q4. We'll be accruing a cash dividend this year. Hopefully,
we can return that to shareholders in – sometime in Q4 or Q1 of next year.
In terms of the business and how that's performing, I'll let José Antonio answer that. But I would say that both –
the more challenging region this year has been without doubt Europe, but UK and Spain which have been the
hardest hit from an economic point of view, and therefore, we have our customers, and therefore, we have also
reflected that. But the last couple of quarters have been quite encouraging. There is a lot of uncertainty. But
remember, we've seen lockdowns in Spain being very, very – I'd say, probably at the level of the more difficult
ones right now. So, we know what happens in a lockdown. We know what happens to activity, to the top line. And
both the UK and Spain have shown on a quarter-on-quarter basis, 5% to 6% increase in net interest income and
doing much better also on fees. So – and the transformation of the UK is not just about revenues.
And by the way, UK has done really well in terms of mortgage growth, growing £4.5 billion in mortgages and
actually more or less the same on business loans. So, again, volumes have done well. Margins are improving and
very importantly very, very strong performance in costs. Again, not just the UK, Spain year-on-year is reducing
cost by 10%.
I want to stress that our focus in both the UK and Spain is going to be growth in revenues. But of course better –
through better experience for our customers, but the new operating model will obviously – is going to be also
reducing our cost. We think of it as productivity and I said I believe that we will be – our aim is to reduce €500
million of the €1 billion additional cost we announced in 2021. So, in the US, SBNA as I said, is part of the US

business with consumer and net interest income in 2021 at – has gone up by 4%. Total SBNA has gone up by
2%, Santander Consumer by 8%.
So, in spite of the lower rates doing well and net interest income, if you want to think about the retail side separate
from the consumer side even though increasingly they're working together, I would also say that for the last few
years, we've been more concentrated on regulatory remediation controls setting up the structural basis for growth.
So, you should start seeing a different behavior of our business in the next couple of years. Again, we are very
proud that in a year like this, the US has been, I can say, our best performing country at least in terms of the
bottom line and growth and profits.
Do you want to add anything on the business, UK? I think I...
