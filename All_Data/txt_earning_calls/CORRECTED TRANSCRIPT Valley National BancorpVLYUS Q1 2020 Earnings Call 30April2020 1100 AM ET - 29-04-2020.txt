With that, I'll turn the call over to Ira Robbins.

Ira D. Robbins
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Travis. Good morning and welcome to those of you that have joined the call today. On behalf of the
Valley team, we hope that you and your families remain safe and healthy during this challenging time.
This morning, I will update you on efforts that we have taken to support our employees, clients, and communities
amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Mike will then offer details on the financial results, CECL implementation, and
our recent liquidity initiatives, before opening the call up to your questions.
The global health crisis brought on by the spread of COVID-19 has quickly changed our world in many ways. For
the first time, our management team is hosting this quarterly call remotely. This is consistent with our business
continuity plan, as well as the social distancing guidelines and work from home procedures that have become the
norm.
COVID-19 has also brought significant and rapid changes to the operating environment for our company. For the
last few years, we have messaged our ongoing technology transformation, significant strength, diversity, and
depth of our management team. Over the last two months, these forces have come together and driven Valley's
swift and decisive crisis response. Our agile technology enabled a quick and effective work-from-home transition
for 93% of our non-retail employees.
Further, we leveraged our technology platform to create an efficient digital application process for the SBA's
Paycheck Protection Program, which I will highlight in more detail momentarily. In February and early March, our
finance and treasury teams were quick to lower deposit costs in response to declining interest rates. These efforts
were made possible by an engaged and flexible response from our deposit operations team and branch network,
and helped to offset earning asset yield pressure and insulate our net interest margin during the quarter.
While we were well ahead of our local competitors in our deposit repricing actions, we still saw strong growth this
quarter in our non-interest-bearing transaction and saving balances, which speaks to the underlying strength of
our entire deposit franchise. These actions position us well from a margin perspective entering the second
quarter. Our experience management team also quickly identified potential industrywide liquidity stresses and
acted to fortify our liquidity position.
These actions and so many others in the last few months directly validate our strategic technology focus and our
longer-term efforts to deepen and diversify our management team. Further, I believe the current environment,
coupled with our success over the last couple of months, reinforces the strategic vision that we have outlined, one
which encompasses leading technology infrastructure to support the human element of banking.
Banks like Valley are meaningful, meaningful to our economy, meaningful to our communities. We provide a
differentiated customer experience which blend technology with live bankers. It's not difficult to look to the future
and understand the value of having a motivated and knowledgeable team supported by leading-edge technology
to drive relationship banking.
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I wanted to highlight a few of our other key responses to the COVID-19
environment. With regard to our employees, I previously mentioned that 93% of our non-retail employees have
been unable to work remotely. This is required to coordinate a distribution of laptops, other hardware, and remote

support. Valley has also paid $1.8 million in special bonuses to our hourly and part-time employees, and agreed
to cover 100% of out-of-pocket medical costs associated with the COVID-19 virus.
From an operations perspective, approximately 36% of our branches are currently closed, with the rest offering
either drive-up service or lobby service by appointment. We quickly adopted a rotational staffing model in our
branches, which has helped us manage health risk and maximize our ability to consistently serve our clients.
There are three other key initiatives that I would like to discuss, which illustrates our team's dedication to servicing
our clients in these unprecedented times. We are helping our commercial and small business clients take
advantage of the various government support programs available to them, most notably the Paycheck Protection
Program, or PPP.
As details of this program emerged, we mobilized to develop an online application solution. This eased the
application process for our customers and helped us effectively manage the loan submission process to the SBA.
By the time the initial phase of the PPP was exhausted a few weeks ago, Valley had originated over 5,000 SBA-
approved loans totaling $1.6 billion of volume.
To put this success in perspective, our $1.6 billion of volume is more than 2.5 times the amount of PPP
originations that would be expected based on Valley's asset size. Our median originated loan size was
approximately $100,000 and roughly one-third of all of our applications were for those below $50,000. This gives
us a sense of our efforts to assist the smaller companies most at risk in the current environment.
We continue to work with our most challenged commercial and retail clients on forbearance solutions. As of April
26, we had approved forbearance request on nearly 2,600 commercial loans covering $2.6 billion. As you can see
on slide 5, excluding taxi medallion deferrals, 97% of the approved commercial deferral balance were perpetuated
loans.
We have also approved over 3,600 consumer forbearance requests for nearly $450 million of principal balances.
While we continue to work with our at-risk borrowers, the inflow of forbearance requests has noticeably slowed in
recent weeks.
Earlier this month, we proudly launched our Community Recovery CD program. This online-only CD opportunity
[ph] forwards (00:08:03) social distancing efforts, and provides an attractive rate to new and existing deposit
customers. Valley is donating 50 basis points of deposits raised under this program back to those in our
communities most directly impacted by COVID-19.
We believe this is the first deposit promotion of its kind. We have currently raised nearly $45 million in deposits
under this program, equating to a direct donation of $225,000 back to our local communities. We look forward to
further marketing this program across our entire footprint and driving additional financial support back into our
communities.
In addition to the Community Recovery CD, we have committed to invest $2 million in New Jersey Community
Capital's Garden State Relief Fund to further support New Jersey small businesses. We have also donated
$200,000 to food banks in our footprint, which have provided over 2 million meals to those in need.
Throughout this presentation, we will provide additional information on our exposure to industry's potentially
impacted by the virus, and thoughts on the other potential implications to our businesses and mitigating efforts we
have taken to address those impacts head-on.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Transitioning now to the financial results. In the first quarter of 2020, Valley reported net income of $87 million and
earnings per share of $0.21. These results include approximately $1 million of after-tax merger expenses related
to the acquisition of Oritani and over $2 million of infrequent expenses associated with Valley's response to
COVID-19.
On a pre-provision basis, results reflect continued progress on our stated goals of consistent growth and
improved operating efficiency. On a year-over-year basis, we generated 24% growth in adjusted revenue against
only 11% increase in adjusted expenses. Exceptional progress on these fronts was mitigated in the quarter by a
larger provision reflecting the impact of COVID on the economic outlook.
While Mike will provide additional details, we recognized a $35 million provision in the quarter, of which roughly
50% was related to incorporating a weaker economic forecast into our reserve methodology at the end of the
quarter. Even with this significant provision, our adjusted earnings per share decreased only modestly from the
first quarter of 2019.
Overall, we're proud of our COVID-19 response and our first quarter achievements. Despite the challenges of the
current environment, we will continue to operate the bank in the conservative manner that investors have come to
expect and that has served us so well over our history. Our credit losses in the prior crises were lower than our
peers as a result of our strong credit culture and prudent approach to underwriting.
While our geography has expanded since the last crisis, our conservative lending philosophy remains unchanged.
We operate in resilient demographic markets that we expect will be quick to bounce back as the environment
normalizes. With this in mind, we will continue to manage items under our control and position ourselves for
sustainability and success as we emerge from these challenging times.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn for some additional financial highlights during the quarter.

Thank you, Ira. Turning to slide 7, highlighting our quarterly net interest income and margin trends, Valley's
reported net interest margin increased to 3.07% from 2.96% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The first quarter's
margin includes 9 basis points of benefit from higher accretion on purchased credit-deteriorated loans that
resulted from the implementation of CECL.
Exclusive of this, net interest margin on an adjusted basis was 2.98%, up 2 basis points sequentially. This is a
continuation of the upward trend experienced in the fourth quarter of 2019 and reflects our success in quickly
reducing non-maturity deposit cost as benchmark interest rates declined in the quarter.
On the deposit side, we continue to experience customer rotation out of CDs and into non-interest and transaction
accounts. Going forward, we believe that there is additional room to reprice CDs and wholesale funding sources
lower as these liabilities mature. This opportunity is outlined on slide 8.
Earlier Ira mentioned certain initiatives that we undertook during the quarter to build liquidity and ensure we have
the balance sheet resources necessary to respond to our customers' needs during these uncertain times. In the
last two weeks of March, we added $1.4 billion of FHLB advances with a weighted average term of 4.5 months.
By utilizing slots on a portion of the advances, the all-in costs of these advances will be roughly 20 basis points.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Subsequent to quarter-end, we added an additional $400 million of short-term FHLB advances and over $1.4
billion of brokered CDs with a weighted average term of 8.5 months and a weighted average cost of 1.2%. As a
result of our liquidity actions, quarter-end cash and equivalents exceed $1 billion. While this excess liquidity may
produce a modest near-term drag on our net interest margin, we firmly believe that these efforts are prudent,
given the uncertain environment we currently face.
Slide 12 illustrates the swift reduction in non-maturity deposit costs that we drove in March. CD rates also trended
lower in the quarter. And as you saw from the 12-month forward maturity schedule on slide 8, additional
opportunities exist to reprice retail CDs and wholesale funding costs lower, should the current rate environment
persist.
On the asset side, as you would expect, we continue to see yields under pressure. During the quarter, reported
loan yields declined 7 basis points, despite a 10 basis point benefit from accelerated PCD loan accretion.
Origination yields declined 17 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of the significant reduction in
benchmark rates in the second half of the first quarter. Despite this pressure, new origination spreads increased
to 12 basis points in the quarter and are up nearly 30 basis points in the last six months.
Moving on, our noninterest income increased 9% from the linked fourth quarter driven primarily by a $4 million
increase in swap fees. Despite strong sequential growth, adjusted fee income was 13.5% of adjusted operating
revenue during the quarter, slightly below the prior quarter's 13.8% level. This decline in the ratio is largely a
product of strong net interest income growth, partially attributable to a full quarter's impact from the acquisition of
Oritani.
Swap fees were approximately $14 million during the quarter, as we originated back-to-back swaps on
approximately $505 million of notional loans, up from $400 million in the prior quarter. Going forward, we would
expect swap fees to return to a lower level reflecting less overall activity.
Our net residential mortgage gain on sale income declined 13% sequentially, as the volume of loan sold declined
to approximately $200 million from $300 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. On a positive note, gain on sale
margin increased more than 50 basis points to 2.46%, which partially mitigated the volume decline.
Slide 9 provides an overview of our quarterly operating expenses and the significant progress we have made on
the efficiency front. Our reported expenses decreased approximately $40 million from the prior quarter. This
quarter's reported figure includes $1.3 million of merger-related expenses compared to approximately $47 million
of infrequent expenses in the prior quarter. The pre-tax amortization of tax credit investments was roughly $3
million for the first quarter of 2020, down from $4 million in the prior quarter.
Our adjusted expenses, exclusive of tax credit amortization and previously mentioned infrequent items, were
$151 million, up $6 million, or approximately 4%, from the previous quarter. Roughly one-third of the sequential
expense increase is due to $2 million of COVID-related special bonus and cleaning costs accrued during the
quarter. As the Oritani systems conversion occurred in mid-February, we expect full synergies to be recognized in
the second quarter.
Last quarter, we told you that we were on track to achieve our adjusted efficiency goal below 51% during 2020.
As you can see, we hit that mark this quarter with an adjusted efficiency ratio of 49.3%. As Ira mentioned, on a
year-over-year basis, we have generated 24% revenue growth, with only an 11% increase in adjusted operating
expenses.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
While the COVID operating environment is uncertain, our management team remains focused on efficiently
allocating personnel and financial resources to business lines and products that provide the greatest returns on
our expense base.
Total loans increased 10% on an annualized basis to $30.4 billion. Growth was strongest in our commercial
categories, with CRE and C&I increasing 11% and 14% annualized. As one would expect given the environment,
we did see commercial line utilization, which includes construction tick up to 46% at the end of the quarter from
44% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The most significant increase was noted in our Florida markets. Since the end
of the quarter, line utilization has been relatively stable. Meanwhile, our non-mortgage consumer portfolio
declined 3% on an annualized basis, as both home equity and automobile balances fell.
From a timing perspective, growth accelerated throughout the quarter and peaked at an annualized rate of 16% in
March. Loan origination in the first quarter totaled approximately $1.4 billion, up 11% from the first quarter of
2019. Since the end of the quarter, COVID-related economic shutdowns in our markets have slowed both new
originations and unexpected paydowns.
As traditional origination activity has slowed, we have diverted resources to managing the demands of the
Paycheck Protection Program. We received approximately 13,000 loan requests under the PPP; and under the
first phase of the program, we originated 5,100 loans totaling $1.6 billion.
Our median loan size was approximately $100,000. Our expectation is that a large amount, between 80% and
85% of loans made under this program, will be forgiven and off our balance sheet in the near term. The remainder
could remain on balance sheet for two years.
As a reminder, loans originated under this program are fully guaranteed by the government. While the loans carry
a modest 1% yield, the SBA will pay lenders processing fees of between 1% and 5% per loan based on the size
of each originated loan. These fees will accrete through interest income over the life of each loan. Valley
originated $1.6 billion of SBA-approved loans in the initial phase of this program and has generated approximately
$47 million in expected processing fees from the SBA.
This was an extremely successful initiative for Valley and reflected the dedication and efforts of a significant
portion of our team. The overwhelming majority of our borrowers under this program had a preexisting Valley
relationship. However, in select instances, we leveraged our PPP strength to service new clients. In many cases,
these new clients brought significant deposit relationships to Valley.
On slide 11, we detail our outstanding loans to industries which have primary or secondary pandemic exposure.
Approximately $2 billion, or 7%, of our loans are to industries that have primary exposure to the pandemic. These
include nonessential doctor and surgery centers, the hospitality and foodservices industries, and retail companies.
You will note that 95% of our loans in these segments are currently rated Pass under our credit methodology and
we approved deferral requests on approximately 28% of these loans. We also have identified our exposure to
industries such as manufacturing and education, which may be less impacted by the virus. Again, you will note
the overwhelming majority of these credits are Pass-rated indicating strong positioning prior to the COVID
outbreak.
While total deposits declined modestly in the quarter, underlying trends were strong as customers rotated out of
CDs and into noninterest and transaction accounts. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased 14% sequentially on
an annualized basis to comprise 24% of total deposits up from 23% in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Similarly, interest-bearing non-CD deposits rose 23% on an annualized basis. As a result of the quarter's strong
loan growth, our loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 104.9% from 101.8% at the end of the fourth quarter. While
total CDs declined $1.2 billion from December 31, approximately 75% of that was due to the roll-off of brokered
CDs, which we opted to replace with lower cost FHLB advances.
Overall, retail deposit retention has been favorable to-date. As mentioned, subsequent to quarter-end and
consistent with our multi-phased liquidity plan, we added $1.4 billion of brokered CDs at favorable terms. For the
quarter, interest-bearing deposit costs fell 19 basis points to 1.40%. This improvement reflects our decision to
aggressively manage non-maturity deposit costs lower as interest rates fell. However, as deposit cost reductions
occurred late in the quarter, it may be more useful to point out that, in April, our funding costs are trending
approximately 50 basis points lower than the first quarter.
Largely as a result of enacting our liquidity plan, total borrowings increased by $1.7 billion in the quarter, with the
majority of that growth coming late in the quarter. Specifically in the last two weeks of the quarter, we added $1.4
billion of FHLB advances, with a weighted average maturity of 4.5 months. As a result of utilizing spots on a
portion of the advances, the net cost to this $1.4 billion is just 20 basis points. This quarter, we have
approximately $2 billion of CDs at a weighted average cost of 2.1% and $2.5 billion of brokerage CDs at a
weighted average cost of 1.7% expected to mature.
Assuming market rates remain relatively stable, we would expect an additional repricing benefit from these
maturities even as we continue to ladder out our funding sources to remain relatively neutral from an interest rate
risk position.
Slide 13 of our presentation details our CECL implementation. Our allowance for credit losses increased nearly
$130 million between December 31 and March 31, with the increase coming in two phases. On January 1, our
allowance for credit losses increased by $100 million as a result of Day 1 CECL adjustments. This was comprised
of $38 million for non-PCD loans and unfunded commitments, and $62 million for acquired PCD loans. Exclusive
of the PCD reclassification, the transition from incurred loss methodology to life of loan loss methodology added
approximately 13 basis points to our reserve.
Then during the quarter, we saw an additional $30 million reserve build, which increased our allowance inclusive
of PCD to 0.96% of loans. This reflects a $34.7 million provision and $4.8 million of net charge-offs. Roughly $6
million of the quarter's provision was related to lower valuations on taxi medallion loans. Another 50% was due to
the incorporation of updated economic forecast from Moody's inclusive of the effects of COVID-19 into our multi-
scenario CECL model, as well as the conservative reweighting towards Moody's recession scenarios.
In general, our economic forecasts assume a steep drop in GDP in the second quarter of 2020 and a relatively
gradual U- or L-shaped recovery taking several quarters. From an unemployment perspective, our forecast
generally assumes double-digit unemployment for the next few quarters. Future provisioning activity will be largely
dependent on the degree that economic outcomes track our expectations.
Slide 14 provides an insight into the quarter's credit metrics. On a reported basis, our non-accrual loans more
than doubled to $206 million, or 0.68% of total loans. Roughly 65% of the sequential increase accounting for $74
million was due to the reclassification of acquired PCI loan pools to individual PCD loans with related loan
reserves under the CECL methodology.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
An additional 33% of the non-performing asset increase was due to the transition of $37 million of previously
accruing taxi medallion loans to non-accrual status during the quarter. Exclusive of these two items, non-accrual
loans would have been unchanged at 0.31%.
You can see the growth in our capital ratios and tangible book value on slide 15. Our tangible common equity
ratio declined to 7.3% from 7.5% at December 31, but remains significantly higher than 6.6% a year ago. The
reduction from December is primarily a result of strong asset growth and our excess liquidity position. We
estimate that our excess liquidity dragged on our tangible common equity ratio by approximately 11 basis points.
Recall that the tangible common equity ratio was also impacted by about $28 million as a result of the non-PCD
portion of our Day 1 CECL adjustments. We believe that we have sufficient capital to support our growth
opportunities and to absorb additional provisions should our economic outlook deteriorate further.
And on the timing of PPP loan forgiveness, we could see further tangible equity capital ratio declines in the
second quarter. All else equal, we estimate that each $500 million of PPP loans remaining on the balance sheet
would temporarily reduce our tangible common equity ratio by 10 basis points. However, we expect the majority of
these loans to be forgiven in the near-term and there will be no impact to regulatory ratios.
Last quarter, we provided 2020 guidance for key elements of our business. On an annualized basis, our first
quarter results exceeded our guidance for loan growth, net interest income growth, and efficiency, putting us on
track for a very strong year. However, with the backdrop of this global health crisis, we have decided to eliminate
our guidance. While we continue to learn more each day about the potential impact of this global health crisis on
the banking industry and Valley specifically, there's simply too much uncertainty to confidently provide financial
guidance to our analysts and investors.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Ira for some closing commentary.

Thanks, Mike. Obviously, our prepared remarks this quarter are somewhat different from what we have provided
in the past. These are unique and challenging times. However, I would like to reiterate that on all fronts, Valley's
response to the crisis has been swift and decisive, and early outcomes have been positive, all largely reflective of
the strong leadership team we have assembled. I firmly believe in times like this, our ability to be agile, proactive
in our focus, steadfast in our strategy, and commitment to Valley will in combination be an unbelievable
differentiator for Valley and our shareholders. We will continue to operate with a sense of urgency and navigate
the uncertain future with an eye to the future and the unbridled opportunities now available.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your provisioning – your thoughts on provisioning going forward. It
sounds like you captured sort of a lot of what the models spend currently in terms of this first quarter provision.
But is there another leg up in your mind later in the year when you start to see some of these quantitative factors
form in terms of whether it's increased NPAs or ultimately increased charge offs? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Hi, Frank. It's Mike. I'll take a stab at this one. The CECL models, regardless of who has them, are primarily
dependent upon the loss history. So, these are probability default and then loss given default models. So, the loss
history that you have built into your model is going to be the primary driver of what your future view, your life of
loss loan would be. However, I do want to point out and I, hopefully, talked about this in my prepared remarks, we
made a change late in the quarter to look at a more severe scenario as more and more information was coming
out related to COVID. And so we use a blended model of various economic forecasts from Moody's to come up
with that economic forecast. And in the end, that change resulted in GDP reductions of 24% in the second quarter
and U3 unemployment of 12.5%, which we think right now that should cover, as we see it today, the loan losses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Valley National Bancorp
And maybe just following up a bit on that, Frank, if we were to use the Moody's model as of mid-April, we have
only seen about a $5.5 million increase in what that reserve number was. So I think we were pretty aggressive.
Back to your point regarding the quantitative metrics, I think that's the challenge for all of us in looking at what the
reserves look like today. We're not going to know until third quarter, until many of these loans come off of deferral,
as to what the impact is to some of these quantitative metrics that Mike talked about before.

Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
All right. Okay. And then just a follow-up, in terms of – as you guys are doing your internal stress testing, when
you look at your severely adverse scenario, anything you can share with us in terms of how comfortable you are
with what sort of capital cushion you're left with after losses in that scenario and how comfortable you are with the
dividend in a scenario like that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. So if you look backwards at the 2018 severely adverse scenario, we believe based upon that, that our
0.96% reserve would cover approximately 0.87 times the cumulative severe loss rate. From our looking at other
people that have reported so far, we think their numbers are closer to 0.5x or 0.6x. So we think we're in a pretty
good position there. And I would say, ultimately, the Moody's S3, which would be the more significantly adverse
scenario, we're at 0.91%. So on a relative basis, we feel pretty good about where we came out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay. And then the dividend in terms of – in those scenarios, I would assume given where you come out, that the
dividend is part of that stress testing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Valley National Bancorp
Absolutely. We run, obviously, as Mike alluded to, a lot of different stress tests over the years, a lot of them based
on the severely adverse scenarios that were provided by the FRB, as well as our own internal stress tests
focused on some of the other variables that we think drive performance within the organization. Right now when
we look at those stress performances, we think we have sufficient capital.
I'll just highlight, last year at this time, we were sitting at 6.63% as a TCE to TA. Today we're sitting at 7.31%. Our
Tier 1 leverage ratio went from 7.58% to 8.24%. Tier 1 risk-based went to 9.38% to 9.95%. If you go back to when
we started back in 2007-ish timeframe, we were only seeing a TCE of 6% when we entered the last major
recession. So I think as an organization, we're in a much stronger position than we were previously.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
First question on NIM. So with pressure coming on from the earning asset yield side, how do you think about how
much deposit cost can offset this? And what are you thinking about the trajectory of net interest income and NIM
into the next quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
So first I would say that we're working hard to protect our NIM and we have some tailwinds, I think, that make us a
little unique right now in the space. First, as you see on page – or on slide number 8, you can see the repricing
that we have that's going to occur in the second quarter for both our originated CD book, as well as the brokered
CD book. When you look at that and combine it with the non-maturity and [ph] unbacked (00:36:06) – frankly, all
other deposit repricing that we did, and we did that early when the Fed reduced rates and we were fairly
aggressive. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we went from a total cost on the non-maturity side of [ph] 1.04
(00:36:21), another 50 basis points down. We think we are doing about as good a job there as we can to protect
the NIM. While admitting clearly that on the earning asset side, yields are going to go down. But also, we put
floors in to kind of protect the NIM there as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Lau Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for that. And then just on your slide 11, where you give COVID exposures by loan segment, you
mentioned that there's 70% there secured by real estate. In this breakdown, in this table, are there any segments
that have a larger exposure to those not secured by real estate? And could you give some color on credit quality if
there is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, sure. This is Tom Iadanza. Yeah, looking at those high risk – and I'll just pick the hotel and hospitality as
the first one, 45% of our portfolio has requested and has been approved for deferment. 100% of that portfolio is
secured by real estate with an origination loan-to-value of 59%. When you kind of go down each and every one of
these, the only one that probably has a low percentage that retail trade, which represents auto dealerships, a little
over 50% of that portfolio is real estate secured. The balance is floor planned. But in general, it's not a big portion
of the deferment. It's not a big portion of our overall portfolio.
In the restaurant space, very similar trend to the hotel space, pretty much 100% secured by real estate, loan-to-
value more in the 65%. And in each of these categories, we carry personal guarantees. So, we believe it's fairly
well-protected, but there's still uncertainty as to when they come out. In Florida, the governor announced that he's
going to allow restaurants to open shortly, but with a lower occupancy than they would be normally permitted to
have.

Good morning, Matt.

Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Just going back to the reserve, is there any unamortized marks that you have, and could you quantify that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Well, there's $6.3 billion of PCD loans remaining, and the mark on that is $87 million over eight years. Other than
that, no. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
...if you think about that, that's going to – we think that's going to level up. Obviously, we don't control those if
loans prepay and you'd accelerate. But, no, we think that's going to level off.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And should we think about that $87 million combined with the allowance as it stands today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
You certainly could if you want to. It, obviously, doesn't go through allowance. It goes through interest income,
and then finds its way, hopefully, to retained earnings. But you could.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Valley National Bancorp
It doesn't roll into our calculations on that. So, when you look at how we're thinking about it, when you look LGDs
and PDs and what we think we need to reserve, that $87 million is definitely not a component of it.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Okay. Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about what happened with the early-stage delinquencies this
quarter, commercial real estate especially? What happened? Why the increase? Can you just give us some color
on the larger credits and relationships that you referenced?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. It's Tom again. There is about $48 million increase in the commercial real estate space. $20 million of that
was administrative, current for payments, but the loan had matured. All of that has been renewed and is now off
past due. The remaining balance was just a mix of low loan-to-value loans that are chronically late in that 30-, 60-
day bucket, but they pay, they stay within those buckets. And our long-to-value on those is probably sub-40%.
And there's no single large exposure within that category. It's a group of smaller loans.

Just to touch on the reserves and your CECL outlook and kind of, Mike, as you'd indicated, so much of what
drives the CECL model is your historic loss rates. And overall, when you give that 91% or so of – your reserve
now accounts for the Moody's S3 forecast, that's really impressive.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
I guess my question is just how are you quantifying the change in the book, right? I know Ira and I know the
culture at Valley, like you guys are so committed to your conservative underwriting standards. But the really of it
is, is the books changed, right? You moved into different geographies. A lot of the growth – you've accelerated
your growth over the last couple of years, so you could argue late-cycle asset adds. Just kind of walk us through
how you're thinking about the change in the portfolio today relative to what it was pre- and post-crisis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Valley National Bancorp
Let me just start, and I'll turn it over to Mike and Tom. Look, we're definitely acknowledging we are in some
different geographies than what we were in prior. But keep in mind, when we went into Florida, we were pretty
selective about the banks that we looked to merge with. And then we've been further selective as to the assets
that we put on. If you recall in the CNL transaction, we actually [ph] throughout – or not throughout (00:42:14), but
let run off about 15% of the book just because it was in asset classes that we weren't comfortable with.
We have a specific asset credit philosophy within this organization, and that does not change irrespective of that
geography that we're in. The borrowers that we look to, those are the people that are the ones that are supporting
the individual loans. It's not a transaction. What the borrower's exposure is when it comes to contingent liabilities,
what their liquidity looks like. These are our core philosophies that we have within the entire organization that we
propelled across the entire geography that we're in.
I think we've been in some of these geographies for a long enough time that the book represents how we lend,
who we are, and not necessarily what traditional experience would have been for some other lenders in these
markets. I don't know if Mike and Tom have some other thoughts on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Coming into this earnings season, we knew that people were going to have a difficulty – and when I say people, I
mean on the analysts side, we're going to have difficulty trying to look at what does 0.96% allowance coverage
ratio at Valley, what does that mean when you look at it across the universe of other midsized banks? I would just
point you to the fact that our allowance as a percent of loans increased 75% from fourth quarter to first quarter.
And by our estimation, our peer group only was up 50%.
Why is there a 25% differential? Two things mostly driving this. One, the fact that we used a pretty severe
Moody's economic forecast, a combination of several of their forecasts. And then maybe more importantly to your
question, Collyn, we also use a – we should have talked about this earlier – we use a qualitative overlay on top of
the model as well to account for things that aren't accounted for in the history in the portfolio, one of those being
the Florida portfolio as an example. So we put on additional loss history for the industry, because we don't have it
ourselves to increase our reserves as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
And just to add a little bit to that, Collyn. When you look at the metrics of our portfolio, there is no concentration by
region, by loan type, by size. We're still very granular. Our production in the first quarter, our average real estate
loan is less than $3 million and our average C&I loan is less than $1 million. So we continue to do the same things
that we've always done.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Looking at it, over 50% of our business is generated from our long-term valued customers and the balance comes
from new customers that we actively have been soliciting for years and are all well-known to people within the
bank. So it is about relationship banking, it is about knowing, and it is about being very granular in how we
proceed and how we do our business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's great additional color. And then just my one follow-up to that would be, and you sort of touched on
this. But just as we look at your slide 11, where you go through the exposed loan segment, obviously, how Florida
and New Jersey/New York are behaving through this pandemic are very different. Just curious as to if you have
kind of the geographic split between what's up in these markets versus what's in Florida in terms of your loan
exposures, and then also to where you're seeing deferral requests.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, sure. The deferral request is pretty much along the lines of percentage of portfolio we have in each market.
We're not seeing any higher in any one of the regions. Our hotel portfolio, which I described earlier being real
estate secured, lower loan-to-value going into this, is, for the most part, more Florida-related than New York/New
Jersey-related as is our restaurant portfolio, which, again, I described as reliant on real estate at a 65% loan to
value. Other than that, it's as dispersed as you would expect within the regions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Duong with RBC Capital Markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys. Just going on that regional breakout, do you guys have the breakout of what's actually in
New York City itself for that COVID exposure?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yes. We have it broken out by location and by type. The largest exposure in New York City that we're realizing
are ambulatory centers. We don't have a big restaurant or hotel exposure in New York City, if any at all. So it's
mostly ambulatory centers, which is a relatively small dollar amount. I think it's in the $90 million range where we
have those in the Manhattan market.
We break it into three. 80% of it is affiliated with large hospital systems or necessary care, being cancer treatment
or knee replacement, and 20% is broken into elective surgery. So, when you look at that, the hospital affiliations
will be fine, and they'll come back. The necessary care will be fine and they'll come back. The cosmetic care will
take a little bit longer to come back. Each of that portfolio is secured. That portfolio carries guarantees from the
state hospital systems, as well as the physicians that [ph] are all in on (00:47:43) the latter category. Well, we
haven't really seen much in office. We haven't really seen much in multi-family coming out of the Manhattan
market.

Ira D. Robbins A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. Couple of questions. Starting with the discussion on NIM, it was mentioned earlier in the call about
how the deposit inflows positions Valley well for the second quarter, and then later on it was mentioned about how
the excess liquidity that's coming on the balance sheet could pressure NIM in the second quarter. And then
furthermore, April funding costs being down 50 basis points is certainly a good thing. It's a long way of saying, are
you willing to disclose how much – when we look at April, the earning asset yield, are you able to disclose how
much the earning asset yield is expected to come down thus far in April?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Not at this point, obviously, because we're disclosing first quarter results. But clearly, the pressure of just waves
coming down generally are putting pressure on our earning asset yields. And as we said, we have a lot of cash
built up. You might ask why did we do that. Early on in this crisis, we decided that putting on some amount of
liquidity was just prudent, because it was so uncertain as to where this was going to go. And keep in mind, that
was before things like the PPP liquidity facility even existed. So one of the things that we feel clearly pretty strong
about is we have the ability right now to fund all of our PPP loans with the liquidity we've built up without even
using any of the government's facilities. Now we may do that. I'm not saying we wouldn't use it. I'm just saying that
our liquidity build put us in a position where we had options.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. Thanks. And then my follow-up is on expenses. You mentioned about how the full synergies from

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
We'll have to get back to you with an exact number. I can give you one of the main components of it that I think
you would probably care to know about. Oritani salary expense for the month of December – remember, we only
had them for about one month in the fourth quarter – was $1.3 million. And so, on a quarterly basis, that would be
$3.9 million. The Oritani salary expense in the first quarter was only $1.8 million , so that's roughly 54%. And I
know on a total basis, our total cost savings right now are running around 70% just in the first quarter. So, we're
almost all the way there, and we'll get the rest of that in the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. And just to add, we identified, between Oritani and Valley, nine branches to be closed through the
integration and merger, and those branches weren't closed until March.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Valley National Bancorp
And if you keep in mind, those numbers weren't even in the forecast of cost save that we've provided. So, we've
already well achieved many of the cost saves or actually all the cost saves that we identified when we announced
the merger. I think to Tom's and Mike's point, the economic benefit is going to be much more recognized in the
second quarter than what it is in the first quarter.
