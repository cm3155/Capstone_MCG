CFO.
Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well
as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC
filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor

William Stanton Demchak
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. 2022 was a successful year for our company, and our strong
performance during the year reflects the power of our Main Street bank model and our coast-to-coast franchise.
For the full year, we reported $6.1 billion in net income or $13.85 per share. Inside of that, we grew loans and
generated record revenue during a rapidly rising rate environment, while at the same time we controlled
expenses, resulting in substantial positive operating leverage for the full year 2022.
Turning to our results for the fourth quarter. We generated $1.5 billion of net income or $3.47 per share. Growth in
both net interest income and fee income contributed to a 4% increase in revenue. Our expenses were up 6% this
quarter, primarily due to increased compensation from elevated business activity, particularly in our advisory
businesses. Rob is going to provide more detail on our fourth quarter expenses as well as our outlook in a few
minutes.
Average loans grew 3% during the quarter, driven by growth in both commercial and consumer. For the full year,
average loans were up 15%, and we continue to grow our loan book in a disciplined manner. As we look ahead,
we are operating our company with the expectation for a shallow recession in 2023.
Accordingly, this outlook drove an increase in our loan loss provision in the quarter and a modest build in reserves
under the CECL methodology. Importantly, as the credit environment continues to trend towards normalized
levels, our overall credit quality metrics remain solid.
I'd add that with charge-offs having been so low, it's not surprising to see volatility quarter to quarter. And we saw
this in the fourth quarter with an outsized loss on one commercial credit pushing us outside of our expected
range.

We continue to manage our liquidity levels to support growth. Our deposits remain relatively stable, and we've
increased our wholesale borrowings to bolster liquidity. During the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to
shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total annual capital return to $6 billion.
Our progress within the BBVA influence markets continues to exceed our expectations, and we see powerful
growth opportunities across our lines of business in these new markets. We continue to generate new customer
relationships, and we have been thrilled with the quality of bankers we've been able to hire.
In summary, it was a solid fourth quarter as we further built on our post-acquisition momentum, delivered for our
customers and communities across the country, generated strong financial results for our shareholders, and put
ourselves in a position of strength as we move into 2023. As always, I want to thank our employees for everything
they do to make our success possible.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to provide more details. Rob?

Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on slide 3 and is presented on an average basis.
Loans for the fourth quarter were $322 billion, an increase of $9 billion or 3% linked quarter. Investment securities
grew $6 billion or 4%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve totaled $30 billion and declined $1.5 billion during
the quarter. And our average deposit balances were down 1%, while period-end deposits remained essentially
stable.
Average borrowed funds increased $15 billion, as we proactively bolstered our liquidity with Federal Home Loan
Bank borrowings late in the third quarter. And these are reflected in our fourth quarter average balances. On a
spot basis, we increased our total borrowed funds by approximately $4 billion compared to September 30.
The period-end increase was driven by $2 billion of FHLB borrowings and $3 billion of senior debt, partially offset
by lower subordinated debt. At year-end, our tangible book value was $72.12 per common share, an increase of
3% linked quarter. And we remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.1% as of December 31,
2022. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility. During the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion of
capital to shareholders through approximately $600 million of common dividends and $600 million of share
repurchases or 3.8 million shares.
Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the same period a year ago, average loans have increased
11% or $33 billion, reflecting increased loan demand as well as our ability to capitalize on opportunities in our
expanded coast-to-coast franchise.
During the fourth quarter, we delivered solid loan growth. Loan balances averaged $322 billion, an increase of $9
billion or 3% compared to the third quarter, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans.
On a spot basis, loans grew $11 billion or 3%. Commercial loans grew more than $9 billion at period-end, driven
by strong broad-based new production in both our corporate banking and asset-based lending businesses.
Importantly, utilization rates within our C&IB portfolio remained stable linked quarter. Consumer loans increased
$1 billion compared to September 30, driven by higher residential mortgage, home equity and credit card
balances, partially offset by lower auto loans. And loan yields of 4.75% increased 77 basis points compared to the
third quarter, driven by higher interest rates.

Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Throughout 2022, deposit balances have declined modestly, amidst
the competitive pricing environment and inflationary pressures. Fourth quarter deposits averaged $435 billion and
were generally stable linked quarter. Given the rising interest rate environment, we continue to see a shift in
deposits from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing.
And as a result, at December 31, our deposit portfolio mix was 71% interest-bearing and 29% noninterest-
bearing. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 1.07% during the fourth quarter. And as
of December 31, our cumulative beta was 31%.
Slide 6 details our securities portfolio. On an average basis, our fourth quarter securities of $143 billion grew $6
billion or 4%. The increase was largely driven by elevated purchase activity late in the third quarter, which
included $3 billion of forward starting securities that settled in the fourth quarter.
On a spot basis, securities were $139 billion and increased $3 billion or 2% linked quarter. The yield on our
securities portfolio increased 26 basis points to 2.36%, driven by higher reinvestment yields as well as lower
premium amortization.
And during the quarter, new purchase yields exceeded 4.75%. At the end of the fourth quarter, our accumulated
other comprehensive income improved to $10.2 billion, reflecting the accretion of unrealized losses on securities
and swaps. Importantly, we continue to estimate that approximately 5% of AOCI will accrete back per quarter
going forward, without taking into account the impact of rate changes.
Turning to the income statement on slide 7. As you can see, fourth quarter 2022 reported net income was $1.5
billion, or $3.47 per share. Revenue was up $214 million or 4% compared with the third quarter. Expenses
increased $194 million or 6%.
Provision was $408 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of a weaker economic outlook, as well as
continued loan growth, which resulted in a $172 million reserve build. And our effective tax rate was 17.7%.
Turning to slide 8. We highlight our revenue trends. In 2022, total revenue was a record $21.1 billion and grew
10%, or $2 billion, compared to 2021. Within that, net interest income increased 22% due to both higher interest
rates and strong loan growth. Noninterest income declined 5%, as lower market-sensitive fees more than offset
strong card and cash management growth.
Looking more closely at the fourth quarter, total revenue was $5.8 billion, an increase of 4% or $214 million linked
quarter. Net interest income of $3.7 billion was up $209 million or 6%. The benefit of higher yields on interest-
earning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs. And as a result, net
interest margin increased 10 basis points to 2.92%. Fee income was $1.8 billion and increased $75 million or 4%
linked quarter.
Looking at the detail, asset management and brokerage fees decreased $12 million or 3%, reflecting the impact
of lower average equity markets. Capital markets and advisory revenue grew $37 million, or 12%, driven by
higher merger and acquisition advisory fees, partially offset by lower loan syndication activity.
Lending and deposit services increased $9 million, or 3%, primarily due to higher loan commitment fees, reflecting
our strong new loan production. Residential and commercial mortgage revenue increased $41 million, driven by
higher RMSR valuation adjustments, partially offset by lower commercial mortgage banking activities. Other

noninterest income declined $70 million linked quarter, reflecting a negative fourth quarter Visa fair value
adjustment compared to a positive valuation adjustment in the third quarter, resulting in a change of $54 million.
Turning to slide 9. Our fourth quarter expenses were up $194 million or 6% linked quarter. The growth was largely
in personnel costs, which increased $138 million, reflecting higher variable compensation related to increased
business activity. Fourth quarter personnel costs also included market impacts on long-term incentive
compensation plans as well as seasonally higher medical benefits.
The remaining balance of the increase in expenses linked quarter included higher marketing spend as well as
impairments on various assets and investments. The majority of these impairments will lower our expenses going
forward and are included in our expense guidance.
As you know, we had a 2022 goal of $300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program
and we exceeded that goal. Looking forward to 2023, we will be increasing our annual CIP goal to $400 million.
This program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments.
Our credit metrics are presented on slide 10. Nonperforming loans of $2 billion decreased $83 million, or 4%,
compared to September 30, and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $1.5
billion declined $136 million or 8% linked quarter.
Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $224 million, an increase of $105 million linked quarter, driven in part
by one large commercial loan credit. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans was 28 basis points in the
fourth quarter. Provision for the fourth quarter was $408 million, compared to $241 million in the third quarter. The
increase reflected the impact of a weaker economic outlook, as well as continued loan growth. During the fourth
quarter, our allowance for credit losses increased $172 million, and our reserves now total $5.4 billion or 1.7% of
total loans.
In summary, PNC reported a strong fourth quarter and full year 2022. In regard to our view of the overall
economy, we're now expecting a mild recession in 2023, resulting in a 1% decline in real GDP. Our rate path
assumption includes a 25 basis point increase in Fed funds in both February and March. Following that, we
expect the Fed to pause rate actions until December 2023, when we expect a 25 basis point cut.
Looking ahead, our outlook for full year 2023 compared to 2022 results is as follows. We expect spot loan growth
of 2% to 4%, which equates to average loan growth of 6% to 8%. Total revenue growth to be 6% to 8%. Inside of
that, our expectation is for net interest income to be up in the range of 11% to 13%, and noninterest income to be
stable to up 1%. Expenses to be up between 2% and 4%, and we expect our effective tax rate to be
approximately 18%. Based on this guidance, we expect we'll generate solid positive operating leverage in 2023.
Looking at first quarter of 2023 compared to fourth quarter of 2022, we expect spot loans to be stable, which
equates to average loan growth of 1% to 2%. Net interest income to be down 1% to 2%, reflecting two fewer days
in the quarter. Fee income to be down 3% to 5% due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity. Other
noninterest income to be between $200 million and $250 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. We
expect total noninterest expense to be down 2% to 4%, and we expect first quarter net charge-offs to be
approximately $200 million.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

Evercore. Please go ahead.

Hey, good morning, John.

Hey, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
On the net interest income side, wanted to see if you can give us a little more thought around the deposit costs,
potentially maybe if you can give us your updated thoughts on where the cumulative beta, I know you're in that
30% – or just over 30%, now 31%...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
...where that could trend to? What's your updated expectation there? And then also maybe on the noninterest-
bearing mix, I know it's 29% of total deposits now. How do you expect that trending over the course of the next
year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Why don't you go ahead? Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sure. Why don't I take the second one first in terms of the mix. Consistent with our expectations in a rising rate
environment, we expect the mix to go more into interest-bearing and we're seeing that. But it's right on track. No
big surprise there. We're right now at 29% noninterest-bearing. I'd imagine that, over the course of 2023, it'll go
down a bit. Our previous low in previous cycles was around 25%. So, I think that's a good way to sort of think
about it.

In terms of the betas, you're right. We finished the year right on top of where we expected. As you know, betas
lagged past historical increases for most of 2022 for us and for the industry. And going forward, we expect maybe
that lag to sort of compress a bit, and we'll start tracking to historical rises, but nothing particularly unusual. And of
course, we don't control that. That'll be an outcome.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hey, John, if you're trying to dig into – I had made a comment at Goldman that we thought our NII might track to
an annualized fourth quarter and in our guide, we look a little light to that. All of that pressure, it's not coming from
funding; it's coming from the spread on loans. So, where we've been surprised, I've been surprised is we just
haven't seen spreads widen in corporate credit.
So, I guess, what I would say to you is – there's this disconnect and something is going to give. Either corporate
spreads are going to widen or our current scenario that we have forecasted for CECL is wrong. So, right now we
basically guide against kind of where spreads are. Maybe we get some widening and we put this mild recession in
CECL. So, we have a little bit of disconnect in the numbers, but they are what they are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. And that gets, of course, to our guidance for the full year in terms of NII. So, the upside would be, to Bill's
point that loan spreads would widen as they should, if we get into the economy that everybody is prepared for.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
So, that widening would provide upside to that 11% to 13%...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, none of the change in kind of thought on NII is driven by any change in our assumption on betas or
deposit growth. We had pretty healthy deposits this quarter. We think we can continue that. It's all on this. We
have an ability, particularly in the new markets to grab a whole bunch of new clients, make new loans that are
good credit loans, kind of invest into this as we've done in our new markets for years, invest into client growth.
The problem is the return right now struggles because we haven't seen spreads gap the way we've seen in the
public markets, the way we might expect given the economy we're kind of forecasting.

Got it. Okay. Thanks, Bill. And then separately on the credit side, can you give us a little more color on the $100

I mean you can jump in here, Rob. That one credit has been staring us in the face for a while. We've been
working on it. It's a credit that both BBVA and PNC were in. So, it shows up as outsized. We had big reserves
against it. As you've seen in our non-performers and our delinquencies there going down, this is kind of – I don't
know what you call this something going through a snake, but we've been staring at it and we charged it off and
that's showing the elevation this quarter, but I wouldn't read into that.

Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hi, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
...just follow up on the NII questions from John there. Can you just remind us where you are on kind of interest
rate positioning? Building in small rate hikes in the beginning of the year, maybe cut later. How do rate hikes from
here kind of impact you? And just a reminder of where you are on the swap book and how that's influencing NII
today and how it rolls off would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, sure. Let me – I'll try to cover some of that, and then we can follow that up. I mean, definitely, we're
positioned to benefit from the two rate hikes that we expect, 25 basis points each in February and March. We do
have a 25 basis point cut in December, but that won't play largely into the 2023 performance. So, we're positioned
well against that, and we'll grow our NII. We're pointing to between 10% and 13% in terms of that range year-
over-year.
Yeah, I will say – and we jumped into this right away, forecasting for a full year in terms of guidance is always
difficult. This year, in particular, it's more difficult than most. You've heard that sentiment from some of our peers
that have already reported. Really difficult because of all the uncertainties that we all know about. So, we put out
what we think we can achieve. Bill and I talked a little bit about maybe some upside to that in terms of loan
spreads. But everything that we know now with all the uncertainties, that's where we're positioned. No big change
in terms of our rate management in terms of the swaps we've disclosed at around $40 billion or so. But of course,
that's all part of how we manage the balance between our fixed and variable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. The simplest way to think about that, John, is we – through the course of the year, the DV01 or the
sensitivity we have for our long positions as if anything decreased. So, think about that in terms of both the
securities book and the swap book. So, we remain largely asset-sensitive, happy with that position. I mean that
over time changes with the mix of swaps and securities. The swaps themselves, it's kind of irrelevant to look at
them separately, but they're very short and they roll off in big bulk couple of years.

Okay. Thanks. And, Rob, maybe as a follow-up, could you unpack a little bit of the outlook for the fee revenues

Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Sure, John. So, just in terms of the categories where we expect to see growth, capital
markets, we do expect mid-single-digit growth, which is good and consistent with our expectations. Our steady
Eddie, card and cash management will probably be up high-single digits. And then those two will be offset by
continuing headwinds in our asset management, given the equity markets as well as lower mortgage production.
So, you put all that together, and that's how we get into our stable to up 1% for the full year.

I've been called worse, Rob. Bill, coming back to your thoughts on the spreads that you guys just referenced on
the commercial loan book relative to the CECL outlook, and I'm glad you framed it that way because I think many
of us are in that camp that you just described. But in terms of the spreads, is there any capacity issues, meaning
there's too much lending capacity, which has kept these spreads maybe lower than normal?

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I'm not sure what's going on, to be honest with you. I mean there's – on the smaller end in certain retail
categories, which really isn't our focus, there's just irrational competition in certain asset categories. In the larger
corporate space, where we have this opportunity to grow clients, particularly in the new market than ultimately
cross-sell, there just hasn't been any sort of gap the way you've seen in the public markets. There hasn't been
any real change.
Spreads aren't going down, but there hasn't been any change at all with respect to kind of the outlook in this
economy. And until – and if there's real defaults and charge-offs, there probably won't be. So, one of these things
is going to give, I just don't know which one it is.

program into 2023. Secondly, it will be at a reduced rate relative to what we did in 2022 and likely to be less than
what we did in the fourth quarter of 2022, which was $600 million.
Couple things about that. One is, why lower? One is, given all the uncertainties that we're seeing, obviously, we
need to be smart and tactical in terms of our capital deployment as the year plays out. But secondly and just
logically, the rate of repurchases slows when your capital ratios go from 10% to 9%. So, we still have a lot of
capital flexibility.

But by definition, as we get closer to those operating guidelines, we slow the pace of repurchases. All that said,
there's flexibility, as you know. So, with the stress capital buffer, we're allowed a lot of flexibility around it. And we
plan to use that flexibility as circumstances present themselves.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Bill and Rob. Following up on your swaps commentary, could you speak broadly to
how you're thinking about downside protection in this environment? Any color you can give on where you'd expect
your NIM to settle if the Fed ultimately pushes the economy into, say, a mild recession, cuts rates and Fed funds
normalizes, say, somewhere in the 2.5% to 3% level? That would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, I had to write all that down in terms of your assumptions there. I would say in terms of NIM – obviously, we
get that question a lot. It's obviously an outcome. So, we don't guide to it. We don't necessarily manage to it. I
think when you just take a step back, you can see that we finished the quarter and finished the year at 2.92%.
That's up from all of 2021 where we lived at 2.27%. So, that 65 basis point jump or so, that's occurred. We don't
expect those kinds of swings going forward. So, going forward, we're now probably more like 5 or 6 basis point
swings off of these levels. And that's sort of the way that I think about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. Separately, there's been some concern that we could see the mix of time deposits and noninterest-bearing
deposits return not just to pre-COVID levels, but perhaps back to even pre-GFC levels in this environment. Can
you speak to that risk, both broadly at the industry level and more specifically as it relates to PNC?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I mean, look, we're in a bit of an unknown environment. We have the Fed going through QT. We have the Fed
absorbing deposits through their reverse repo facility. We have, at least in our case, the ability to grow loans. So,
you could see a scenario where deposits get scarce.
We've priced some of that that's in our forward guide in terms of our best look on that. You can draw upside and
downside to that, kind of to Rob's point. This coming year and the years after that are harder to forecast and
model than some of the stability we had pre-COVID. So, we're doing our best, and you've seen our best
expectations.

Yeah, I think that's right. And in regard to the mix between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing so far, the
shift that has occurred is perfectly consistent with what we've seen historically and consistent with our
expectations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. That's helpful, Bill and Rob. Thank you. If I may squeeze in one last one. Wanted to dig in a little bit into
your expectation for a weaker economic outlook and mild recession and sort of square that with your reserve rate
having been basically unchanged sequentially. So, it suggests that most of the reserve build was really growth
driven. Maybe if the economic outlook does grow more challenging, consistent with that mild recession scenario,
would it be reasonable to expect that your reserve rate could actually hold in your current levels? Or would it still
likely drift a little bit higher from here? Any thoughts around that would help.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, a lot of moving pieces here, but start with the basic notion that we are fully reserved for the book that
we hold today against a forecast that we just – we more heavily weighted the recessionary forecast than we had
in the third quarter. And then remember, the charge-offs that we took this quarter, particularly the lumpier ones,
we mentioned one, those were in a large way already reserved. So, our build, right, is actually more than you
think. The ratio ends up the same, but we have kind of less – we have lower non-performers inside of that total
book as a percentage, maybe think of it that way...

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I wanted to talk a little bit about the expense side. And I know you mentioned that there was a part of the
expenses this quarter that was associated with revenue generating activities like capital markets, and so that is a
net positive to PPOP. So, let's leave those expenses aside.
I wanted to dig in more to the expenses that did not come with commensurate revenues and understand what the
drivers were behind those increasing. And then talk a little bit about your outlook for 2023 off of what is now a
higher base than what people had been expecting coming into today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. I can start there. So, in regard to the fourth quarter expenses, the biggest driver of the increase was
personnel expense and to your point, inside of that, the variable comp associated with the higher business
activity. In addition to that, we did have some medical expenses that we expect seasonally, but they came in a
little bit higher than what we would have expected. Outside of that...

Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
...and that happens, that happens seasonally. This season, it was a little bit higher than what we expected.
Outside of that, when you look at the marketing spend, that's sort of timing in terms of how that falls in the year.
But the impairments that we took on various investments and assets, which is part of your question, there wasn't
anything singular that would stand out. It was a...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes, there was. We wrote off everything we had to do with crypto.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, that was part of it. That was part of it. So, maybe Bill wants to answer these questions. But I would say there
wasn't anything singular, it was a handful of items that we took down in technology, and that shows up in our
equipment expense. In occupancy, there were some facilities that we rightsized for our space needs going
forward, that kind of thing. So, on the margin...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Why don't you go ahead and talk about [ph] the margin (34:43)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Okay. Yeah, sure. And then on the margin, the – I'm sorry, just going into – Bill's giving me another question, but
I'd say on the margin going into 2023, those impairments reduce some of our expense rates, so that sort of
helped. So, our guide is 2% to 4% in all of 2023. That's how that all stays connected.

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Betsy, it's kind of frustrating, because none of the stuff in our expense line in the fourth quarter has
anything to do with how we spend money. I mean the comp with new business is great. Everything else was kind
of – we flushed a couple tech projects that didn't work out. We rightsized occupancy. Marketing went up a little bit.
And then we get hit this quarter on charge-offs, which are – I'm not going to call them artificially high. They are
what they are, but they're kind of lumpy as a function of something that we've been staring at for a while that
finally hits the books.

Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
That's gone. That's right. And that's why – and I said in my opening comments, we point to strong positive
operating leverage in 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. All right. And then separately, I know we talked a little bit earlier about the capital and the fact that your
CET1 has been migrating down as you've been doing some nice lending, et cetera. Just wanted to understand
the RWA density. It looks like it's gone up a bit.
And I just wanted to understand, is that just loan growth? Or is there something else going on there? Is there
some changes in how you think about RWA factors? And then I'm just wondering like how – what is the low on
CET1 that you're willing to drive to as we think about demand for borrowing is still pretty robust?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sure. Well, so a couple of things on that. I would say in terms of the RWA increase, it's entirely loan driven. So,
we've had a lot of loan growth in 2022, a lot in the fourth quarter with that 3% growth in average loans. So, that's
the key driver of the RWA increase. Our CET [CET1] ratio is at 9.1%. We've talked about an operating guideline
of between 8.5% and 9%. So, we're still above our operating guidelines and that's a good place to be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So, 8.5% the low, really, that's how we should read it.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you guys could talk about the [ph] still potential (37:44) for the TLAC
rules to come down to the Category 3s and how you would be thinking about either getting ahead of that or
starting to issue. Or would you just have to wait for the final notice and then consider a phase-in period?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I mean a lot of people talking about this, not a lot happening around it. Were it to happen, by the way, we disagree
with it, but let's walk down the path and say somehow down the road people suggest that this should happen and
there'd be a phase-in period.
Practically, as we look at the growth opportunity in our company, new clients, loan growth against what it is likely
to be a constrained ability to grow total deposits, right, you're going to see our wholesale borrowings increase.
And in the course of our wholesale borrowings increase in the ordinary course of business, we're going to fulfill all
our parts of that TLAC requirement. All of that is in the numbers we're talking to you about – it'll take more than
next year, but in the way we think about [indiscernible] (38:54).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
In terms of the normalized – as we move towards more normalized mix.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, put in its simplest way to think about that maybe is our wholesale debt historically ran, I don't know, in
the mid...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
[ph] 16% to 19% (39:09).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, mid-teens, I was going to say, and we're running 5%. So, if we normalize – that's with home loan in there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
As we normalize our borrowings through time, it's likely we're going to get and fulfill that requirement without
purposely trying to do it. Just because that's the way we and other people will be funding institutions.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I'd just add to that, that's all – we see it on our path. It's not particularly problematic, but there's a lot to be
played out. We still don't think it's necessary and there's also a reasonable chance there'd be some tailoring to it,
which would be reduced in our case.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yes. And as a follow-on to that, to your point about wholesale borrowings, funding loan growth incrementally, can
you just talk about how you're thinking about the securities portfolio? You saw some growth this quarter. I know
you're getting good front book, back book on it. The percentage of earning assets is still around 28%. So, how
would you expect that to go vis-à-vis the use of wholesale borrowings to continue to support that growth as well?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Look, you wouldn't purposely borrow wholesale and then invest in a security to hold in your securities book.
However, inside of all the requirements that we manage ourselves to, we also have liquidity requirements, LCR
and the need to hold high-quality liquid assets. So, the securities book will likely fade in terms of total percentage
over time simply because of loan growth that we see in some of the roll down. That securities book is part of what
we have in terms of cash and liquidity to satisfy LCR.
We're not going to say, hey, let's borrow some money to buy more treasuries, right? That isn't going to happen.
But practically, we use that book to hedge the value of our deposits. We'll continue to do that, and we'll continue
to do that inside of the lens of LCR and other liquidity stresses that we run.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2023
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Well, I guess in the category of no good deed goes unpunished, I mean you did have positive operating leverage
last year of 300 basis points. You're guiding for positive operating leverage this year between I guess, 200 and
600 basis points, your charge-offs were below 30 basis points every quarter. You're buying back some shares, yet
your guidance from one month ago was off and your results fell 1.8% below consensus. Now, don't stop giving
your guidance or anything like that and we're all subject to the uncertainties out there. But just a little bit more
about what's changed in the past month.
So, I guess, unemployment, you end rate assumption, you're saying it's over 5%, maybe where that's going to.
And I guess that drove some of the CECL-driven reserve part of the reserves, the NII and maybe your decision to
lean into the securities purchases maybe because you think this is a relative top on yields? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, you're overcomplicating it. One thing changed from a month ago and one thing only. And that was
basically the spread we thought we'd earn on new business, right? We know, Mike, that we can go out and grow
loans. Our ability to gain clients, cross-sell those clients, we've never been more bullish on that. The process of
doing that is not earning what we would otherwise expect in the moment because spreads have not widened and,
of course, you take a full life of the loan reserve when you book that loan. That's the only thing that's really
changed.
The expenses this quarter are noise. The guide for next year is tempered simply by that question of whether
spreads are going to rise on loans, maybe they will or our CECL analysis will be wrong. We haven't – we never
guide on what our provision is going to be. We talk about charge-offs and the charge-off this quarter we felt was a
bit anomalous. So, nothing's really changed other than the sweat factor of, hey, can I actually earn what I thought
I was going to earn on new loan production. That's it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. You asked a question on the securities book. It's just – we basically stayed pretty much in the same
position all year. We get to reprice the book, and you see the income coming out of the securities book growing
nicely. We haven't invested into it. It's a tough market to invest into. If you are, in effect, a deposit-funded
institution, right, if you want to go out and buy something today against your marginal cost of money, you're
basically carrying flat to negative.
Today, on the theory that the Fed's going to cut to what down the road and you got to believe that the Fed's going
to go back into 2s on Fed funds, which I just fundamentally don't believe. So, I think kind of the market is just
uninvestable at the moment, and I think that's going to be figured out through the course of the year. And so,
there's upside – my view on that plays out in the way we'd run our securities book. But at the moment, there's no
choosing to go long in this environment, I think, is a mistake.

You are reserved for your existing book of business, assuming an unemployment rate of what level? I know it's
above 5%, but could you be more...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
5.1%. 5.1%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q

Got it. All right. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A

Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess, on the NII guide, so I think we've spoken extensively about the spreads. Wanted to get how much of the
inversion in the yield curve was a factor in impacting the NII outlook. And tied to that, like with the 10 years at sub-
3.40% this morning, like do you just not invest right now and wait for things to shake out? Or how do you think
about balance sheet management in a world where maybe the 10 year is headed to 3%, not 4% next? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, that impacts the NII guide a bit only in terms of what our reinvestment yield is and will be when we –
when the existing security book rolls down, right? So, you've seen the book yield on that rise from wherever to –
what is it now – 2.60- something.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2023
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Oh, yeah, the total book. Yeah. 2.65%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. And that continues to increase as we – as things roll off, we're reinvesting with high-4s, 5-handles on
securities. Look, if the 10-year goes to 3%, if you look at the five year and five years, the implication of where
long-term rates really have to head for that to be true, I just don't buy. I don't think we're going to be an
environment where the Fed is bouncing short-term funds around 1%, which I just don't think it's going to happen. I
think we're going to – I think we will get inflation under control, but I think it's going to be a struggle to get it under
3% long term.
And I think front rates will stay higher, they might cut and likely will cut from some 5% level. But this assumption
that they're going to cut and, therefore, rates are going to go back to 2% or 1%, I just think is absurd. So,
therefore, to me, the back end of that curve is uninvestable. You're right, it could rally to there. Good for the
people who own it, as long as it's not me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah. No, that's fair. And again, I'm not saying it makes sense, but it's the world we live in. And I guess tied to
that, I'm not sure if you gave explicit guidance in just terms of deposit growth outlook. I mean, still a lot of room
when we look at the loan-to-deposit ratio. Just give us a thought around how you're thinking about letting
additional sort of rate-sensitive deposits run off, having a smaller balance sheet, creating more excess capital.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Look, there's obviously – we could, in the near term, increase earnings by being less competitive with deposits
and let deposits run off. We have the liquidity to do that. We could increase our loan-to-deposit ratio. The
challenge with that is in the course of doing that, you're damaging your long-term franchise.
So, if you're losing deposits that are not core relationship deposits, and maybe that makes sense, but if you're
losing customers in the process of that run-off, that's a mistake. And that's the logic we use in figuring out how we
price deposits and how we grow or maintain deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's fair. And if I may, one last question, Bill. In terms of just the macro uncertainty, how do you assess like the
difference between credit normalization and whether or not we are getting into some version of a recession? Like,
can you conclusively think about that over the next few months or are we not going to know that until we are well
into the depth of a downturn a few quarters from now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We've given you our best forecast.

Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I mean, look, there's a lot of unknowns here. Technically, we could see ourselves heading into a full employment
"recession" because you'll have stale GDP for a couple of quarters, but unemployment not ticking up to high
levels. And I don't even know how to think about that environment in terms of what charge-offs might be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I mean, that's probably a really low charge-off environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Well, and just to your point, in terms of what I said at the beginning, it's really difficult for the full year,
particularly this year, we've put together what we think we can do.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2023
I was wondering if we could just circle back on some of the lumpy costs. I guess, just in aggregate, like how much
were the impairment? And then I think there was also – you had called out some lumpiness from the long term in
terms of [ph] planning (00:51:21), which I think impacts both fees and comps. If you could just kind of flesh out the
aggregate lumpy costs, that would be helpful. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Without – we don't have specific numbers. You can see them and you can see them as they break down in
terms of our impairments within the occupancy line and the equipment line. The long term was just the effect of a
benefit in the third quarter and then it swung against us in the fourth quarter. So, not big numbers, but just the
delta between the two quarters drove the increase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then separately, I mean, I heard you earlier kind of reiterate the 8.5% to 9% CET1 target over time,
and – just any thoughts on the regional banks kind of just below your size. It seems like they're all kind of building
capital close to 10%. And I don't know if it's pressure behind the scenes from rating agencies or regulators or just
conservatism for where we are in the cycle. But any thoughts on the company your size being able to run 9%
when the ones – obviously that the banks that are bigger are running higher, but it's just been interesting to note
that the ones below you, kind of $200 billion in assets, all seem to be building closer to 10%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Do you want to answer that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, I don't know [indiscernible] (52:38).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, the only thing – the only thoughts that I have just reacting is – because the guidelines are typically drawn for
all banks in terms of the stress capital buffers, so, how they stress, you got to look at that. And then it's the
relative capital level to the stress levels as opposed to the absolute levels. But that's just my reaction.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. But I guess the point is like you feel comfortable with whatever kind of behind-the-scene stuff that's going
on with the rating agencies, regulators, the 9% and maybe drifting down a little bit over time, but at 9% you feel
we're comfortable with in the current environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Our next question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Just a couple of quick ones. Any color on criticized assets, how they did? How those did in the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, relatively flat, not a big change at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And, Bill, just not to beat a dead horse to death, but the whole sort of question on NII and swaps and
protection, given that you think of swaps and securities sort of as synonymously in terms of expressing your view
on rates. I would expect that you're going to hold off, therefore, even on the swap side in terms of adding
protection yet until you see clearer signs of a lot more potential for rate cuts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, it's strange to me, Vivek. You're a bit of a fixed income guy. This notion of protection, I mean what
a lot of banks are doing is they'll put on forward starting swaps and they'll not have to eat negative carry in the
course of doing that. And they'll hope sometime by the time those come due, that there is a negative carry
because there'll be a cut. So, you effectively – I mean everything is priced at the forward curve when they do that
trade. It makes no sense to me. It's the same as choosing to invest at the moment and where the yield curve is.
That's "my downside protection." I can buy – we can sell it, we can use options and sell away upside and buy
some downside protection. As a practical matter, we're not widely out of bounds in terms of while we're asset
sensitive, we're not wildly asset sensitive. And it just doesn't feel like the moment when you're supposed to be
long. Particularly, if you have a view that rates in the go-forward decade are not going to look like rates during the
2012 to 2020 year.
