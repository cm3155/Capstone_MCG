Good morning. Earlier today, Old National reported our second quarter 2024 results. Our earnings per share
exceeded expectations due to better than expected revenue growth and lower expenses, which led to positive
operating leverage. These strong second quarter results were driven by our investments in new markets and
talent in our footprint, supported by our peer-leading low cost deposit franchise, solid credit performance and

ample capital. We remain focused on the acceleration of our wealth management, treasury management and
capital markets businesses.
Before moving to our second quarter highlights, I also want to provide you an update on our previously
announced partnership with the Nashville-based CapStar Bank, which closed on April 1, and expanded our
franchise to several strong and vibrant southeastern markets. I'm pleased to share that, last week, we
successfully completed all banking center and systems conversion for this partnership. As of July 15, all former
CapStar branches have been converted to Old National banking centers and all legacy CapStar team members
are now operating in the Old National network.
The success of our partnership would not have been possible without our team members' hard work, passion,
professionalism and collaboration. And I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank everyone
involved in the integration for a job extremely well done.
Now, moving to our second quarter highlights on slide 5, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.37 per common share
and our adjusted EPS was $0.46. These adjusted earnings per share results exceeded consensus estimates by
$0.02 or 5%. Our adjusted return on average tangible common equity for the quarter was 17.2%, and our
adjusted ROA was 1.12%. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low 52.6%. Excluding deposits and loans assumed
in the CapStar transaction, our total deposit growth was 2.4% annualized during the quarter, and our loan growth
was 5.9% annualized. Including CapStar deposits, we're up a total of $2.3 billion and loans were up $2.6 billion in
the quarter. Our total cost of deposits for the quarter remains at a low 216 basis points. At the same time, we
remain focused on growing our tangible common book value per share, which grew 10% from a year ago.
In summary, our second quarter 2024 earnings evidenced another strong on-plan quarter for Old National. We
exceeded analyst expectations due to our strong deposit franchise, disciplined loan growth, solid credit quality,
and ample capital.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.

Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thanks, Jim. Turning to slide 6, you can see our second quarter balance sheet, which highlights continued
stability in our liquidity and our capital position. Our balance sheet also reflects the close of the CapStar
transaction on April 1. Total deposit growth over the last year has again allowed us to organically fund loan growth
while holding borrowings flat. Additionally, we were able to grow our tangible book value per share 10% over the
last year. Given its relative size and our strong retained earnings in the quarter, the addition of CapStar was
essentially capital neutral, with our CET1 ratio unchanged despite closing the deal.
We continue to expect that we will accrete capital at a faster pace than most through the combination of a better
than peer return profile and a 30% dividend payout ratio. Our loan to deposit ratio ticked up modestly due to
planned deposit runoff of approximately $400 million at CapStar. Our liquidity and capital levels continue to
provide a strong foundation which positions us well as we enter the back half of 2024.
On slide 7, we show the trend in total loan growth and portfolio yields. Total loans grew $2.6 billion, with $2.1
billion attributable to CapStar. Excluding CapStar, total loans grew 5.9% annualized from last quarter, in line with
our expectations. We remain focused on full relationships and structure at prices that meet our risk adjusted
return requirements. New loan production rates in the high 7% range and marginal funding costs in the mid 4%
range support our expectation that net interest income will grow modestly for the remainder of 2024. The
3

investment portfolio increased 3% in the quarter due to the CapStar transaction. Shortly after closing, we
repositioned CapStar investments, which improved our total portfolio yields. Overall, fair values and duration were
effectively unchanged. As we've mentioned in past calls, new money yields continue to run 200 basis points
above back book yields, and we have approximately $1.3 billion in cash flows expected over the next 12 months.
Moving to slide 8, we show our trend in total deposits, which grew $2.3 billion, with $2.1 billion attributable to
CapStar. As mentioned earlier, we intentionally ran approximately $400 million of higher cost deposits out of
CapStar at closing. Excluding CapStar, total deposits grew 2.4% annualized, with normal seasonal outflows in
commercial and retail deposits offset by public fund and broker deposit increases. Our broker deposits as a
percentage of total deposits are 4.6% and remain well below peer levels. We did see a 15 basis point increase in
deposit rates compared to the prior quarter, with CapStar driving approximately 5 basis points of that upward
pressure. That said, deposit costs leveled out at 216 basis points and were steady over the course of the quarter,
which was consistent with our spot rate at June 30. Overall, we remain pleased with the execution of our deposit
strategy and we believe we are stabilizing with respect to both total cost and the non-interest bearing mix.
Slide 9 provides our quarter end income statement. We reported GAAP net income applicable to common shares
of $117 million or $0.37 per share. Reported earnings include the following pre-tax items: $19 million in merger
related charges; and $15 million of CECL Day 1 non-PCD provision expense. Excluding these items, our adjusted
earnings per share was $0.46.
Moving on to slide 10, we present details of our net interest income and margin. Spread revenue and margin were
both slightly better than forecast, primarily due to higher asset yields and accretion. Our low total deposit cost of
216 basis points remains a key competitive advantage. Year-over-year, we again showed deposit growth that
essentially kept pace with asset generation while maintaining a low total cost of funding.
On slide 11, we show trends in adjusted non-interest income, which was $87 million for the quarter, with CapStar
contributing $7 million. Our primary fee businesses performed well, with bank fees in line with our expectations,
mortgage benefiting from seasonality and modest improvements in production and pipelines, and capital markets
returning to more normalized levels.
Continuing to slide 12, we show the trend in adjusted non-interest expenses of $264 million for the quarter, with
CapStar contributing $18 million. Expenses were in line with our guidance and remain very well controlled.
On slide 13, we present our credit trends which remained stable, reflecting the quality of both our commercial and
consumer portfolios. The delinquency ratio remained stable and the non-performing loan ratio decreased 4 basis
points. Total net charge-offs were 16 basis points, and a low 11 basis points, excluding 5 basis points related to
PCD loans. Our second quarter allowance for credit losses to total loans, including reserve for unfunded
commitments, was 108 basis points, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. There were no material changes to
our model assumptions and the weighting on the Moody's S-3 scenario remains 100%. It is also worth mentioning
that our allowance for credit losses, plus the discount remaining on acquired loans to total loans, now stands at
161 basis points.
Slide 14 presents key credit metrics relative to peers. As you can see, our proactive approach to credit monitoring
has led to above peer levels of NPLs, but delinquency and charge-off ratios that are well below peer averages
over long periods of time. We have long practiced conservatism here and we believe the results speak for
themselves. With CRE remaining in focus, we have enhanced disclosure in this quarter's presentation.
I'll turn it over to Mark on slide 15.

President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thanks, John. Given the heightened focus on credit and CRE in particular, this quarter, we decided to dive
deeper into our loan portfolio and specifically expand on certain segments that we have been watching more
closely for some time. Slide 15 breaks down our $36 billion portfolio, which is well diversified across our desired
and actual mix of approximately 40% C&I, which includes owner occupied CRE, given it is underwritten as C&I;
30% investor CRE; and 30% highly rated consumer. Investor CRE of $11.7 billion is well diversified across
subsegments. The most noteworthy of which I will talk about in a minute. Importantly, owner occupied CRE
represents $4.3 billion of our portfolio, with a modest risk profile in line with the rest of our C&I book. Lastly on this
page, our diversity is reflected geographically across our footprint as well, with modest out of market exposures
driven almost entirely by in-market relationships.
We have presented looks similar to slide 16 many times. So, to briefly reiterate, we believe our pending maturity
schedule is extremely manageable. We have always stressed our CRE loans in underwriting at 300 basis points
over current rates, such that the vast majority of our pending maturities have interest rates still within that range.
We have only about $400 million maturing over the next 18 months, which are at rates outside of this underwriting
cushion, and most of those have since seen rent growth well beyond our originally underwritten levels.
CRE office has been a concern industry-wide for some time, so we thought more color was warranted as seen on
slide 17. Though sometimes a segment gets painted with the same brush, not all office loans are alike. With an
average loan size of $2.9 million, our portfolio looks a great deal like the picture on the left, which is generally
lower risk than the one on the right. Our office exposure is well diversified by loan size and geography. The lowest
risk segments in the space, investment grade tenants and/or medical office buildings, comprise over 40% of our
office exposure, and the highest risk segment, central business districts, less than 14%. The credit metrics overall
of our office portfolio are strong, with an average debt service coverage of nearly 1.5 times and a weighted
average loan to value of 64%. As in all of our portfolios, we are well disciplined around maximum individual credit
exposures. In this case, the largest is $50 million and the top 10 dropped dramatically from there.
On slide 18, we cover multifamily, our largest segment in investor CRE at $5.5 billion. Our multifamily lending
trends much more towards middle income tenants than Class A high rises in major metro markets. This book is
also well-diversified and granular, with an average loan size of just over $5 million. Overall, this asset class
remains stable in our markets, although prolonged higher interest rates have impacted some more recent
projects. Here, again, we have strong credit metrics in terms of debt service coverage ratios and loan to values,
and the portfolio is well-diversified by dollar exposure and location. Our largest exposures are well within our
moderate risk tolerance, represent long tenured relationships, and tend to have stronger credit metrics.
I'll now turn the call back to John.

John V. Moran, IV
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thanks, Mark. On slide 19, we review our capital position at the end of the quarter. As expected, ratios were
essentially unchanged from the first quarter, with the impact from the close of the CapStar transaction absorbed
by strong retained earnings.
Slide 20 includes updated details on our rate risk position and net interest income guidance. NII is expected to
increase modestly in the third and fourth quarters. Our assumptions are listed on the slide, but I would highlight a
few of the primary drivers. First, we assumed two rate cuts of 25 basis points each, consistent with the forward
5

curve. Second, we are now anticipating a declining rate deposit beta of approximately 30% and a non-interest
bearing deposit mix that falls to 22% by year-end. We continue to believe that we have positioned the balance
sheet well as we reach the end of this rate cycle and we have achieved a neutral rate risk position. In addition to
the two-cut scenario, we did run a three-cut scenario and a static curve through our models. The results of each
were not materially different from our base case scenario, again, suggesting we have effectively managed the
balance sheet to neutral.
Slide 21 includes thoughts on our outlook for the remaining items of the third quarter and the full year 2024. As
you can see, our guidance is essentially unchanged, with a modest increase in NII reflecting this quarter's results
and a slightly wider provision range. That range reflects loan growth and annual charge-offs that are unchanged.
Although second half charge-offs are expected to run modestly higher than the 15 basis points we have
experienced in the first half, we remain comfortable with the full year outlook of 15 to 20 basis points.
In summary, we had an excellent first half of 2024, with second quarter results better than our expectations and
strong performance metrics. More importantly, we continue to demonstrate our ability to execute against our
strategic priorities. First, we continue to organically fund our loan growth. Second, our adjusted return profile
remains top quartile against peers at 17% on tangible common equity. Third, we remain disciplined on operating
expenses with an adjusted efficiency ratio below 53%. Fourth, we have clean credit with non-PCD net charge-offs
of just 11 basis points, along with a well-diversified and granular loan book. And fifth, we are continuing to rapidly
compound tangible book value per share, which was up 10% year-over-year.
With those comments, I'd like to open the call for your questions.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I guess – yeah, likewise. Thank you. Wanted to ask on just sort of the beta assumption. Maybe, John, when you
think of the 30% down beta, maybe just sort of the inside baseball, sort of why you're thinking that's the right
number and maybe some thoughts on how that would trend after 4Q 2024. Presumably there's some catch up
later on as time marches on. But just curious how that would sort of flex into 2025 as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Thanks, Scott. So, I think most of where we're going to get the down beta from is really out of the exception
price book. That book today is $12.3 billion, 31% or so of total deposits, 38% of our total transaction deposits. And
that's, at the quarter, sort of [ph] $430 million (00:17:16) was the cost on that book. And we think we'll be able to
drop that pretty quick. I mean, I think that'll be close to 85% kind of beta on the way down. So that's where most of
it will be. And then, depending on the path, the short-term rates into 2025, I think that'll sort of influence what
we're able to do with the exception price book. 2025 I think is more about fixed asset repricing though and shape
of the curve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe switching gears for a second to the loan growth, maybe just a
[indiscernible] (00:17:47) on where that growth is coming from. I ask sort of in the context of it's been a very weak
backdrop for the rest of the industry that you all seem to be outperforming. Maybe sort of where is it coming from,
and then maybe over the next several months, do you see trends getting better or worse, and why would that be
the case?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Hey, Scott. It's Mark. The loan growth this quarter was broad across the footprint. It was about evenly split
between CRE and C&I. CRE we had some construction draws that helped boost it a bit. And in C&I, just some of
the hires we've made over the last few years in our expansion markets give us some outsized growth. And this
quarter, we had a really nice quarter from our business banking team. That's our core business, that's full
relationships. And so, it's nice to see them grow nearly $100 million this quarter. So, widely diversified.

Brendan Nosal Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Maybe just to start off on kind of the outlook overall at a top level, I mean, you've broadly reiterated the guide for
the rest of this year, but it feels like a fair bit has changed environmentally since April, especially with respect to
the rate outlook and environment. I guess I'm just wondering if you had a bias of feeling better or worse about the
outlook you've offered now for the past two quarters. Where would you folks [indiscernible] (00:19:17)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Look, I think the balance sheet is neutral. So NII, I mean, we've been saying for a couple of quarters now, it
doesn't really matter what happens with short rates. I think if there were perhaps some room for upside, I pointed
the fee lines where we continue to invest in wealth management. Those investments are starting to bear some
fruit. Mortgage is bouncing along the bottom, but was seasonally better in 2Q than maybe what we would have
expected. That'd be where I think we might have a little bit of upside to the guide out there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Nosal Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Yeah. Perfect. Thanks. Maybe one more from me before I step back. Can you help us unpack the NII guide for
the rest of the year in terms of how you see the margin trending in the back half, especially in light of the core
margin firming up this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I think it's a couple basis points one way or another in third quarter, and then fourth quarter, we'd expect to
see things start to improve.

Good morning, Jared.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Maybe just sticking with the NII and margin, can you share with us what accretion was this quarter and what the
expectation is for accretion as we go into third and fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
I would say the difference in accretion versus the first and the last quarter was about $5.5 million that came in
from CapStar rough top, a 3 basis point helper. And I'd expect that to be pretty flat for the balance of this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. So stable at this, let's call it, [ph] 11.6% (00:21:01) in second quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Right. Yeah. Jared, it's Mark again. In this quarter, we saw about $75 million come in criticized and classified from
CapStar, which is what we expected. And then, multifamily drove the bulk of the rest of the migration this quarter.
Not unexpected. We had some properties with a little lower lease up and so the excess cash flows tightened a bit,
but we still feel really good about those properties. They're really solid properties, strong sponsor support and
very low loss content, we believe.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And then looking at the debt service coverage ratio on office, it looks like that improved or increased this
quarter. Any color on what was driving that? And is that sort of a stable level, you think, for the category?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
I think that remains to be seen. But we haven't seen the deterioration in those ratios to any effect at this point. So
the best eyesight we have is what's happening right now and it seems to be stabilizing.

Hi. Good morning, everyone.

James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Terry. Good to hear from you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Same here. Thanks for slide 17 and 18. I always like pictures. Maybe question for John. Can you just – yeah, I get
simple. How do you fund 5% to 7% annualized loan growth? What's your assumptions on deposit growth, use of
wholesale funding for Q3 in the back half of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Certainly, Terry. The mission around here has been for a really long time, but we probably got even more
focused on it last year, we are all deposit gatherers. And so, certainly the intention would be to fund our asset
generation with core deposits. And we've been able to do that so far. So if you look year-over-year, our asset
generation has basically kept pace with our deposit generation. That would be the plan going forward to the
extent that we have a quarter that deposits are a little bit lighter than the asset generation. We have plenty of
capacity on brokered and a lot of capacity on wholesale as well, if we chose to.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
And I would just remind you, we've said this publicly before, but we're going to remain on the offense. To the
extent that there are banks that will continue to be aggressive as rates fall, we will remain on the offense. And we
just believe this is a good long-term play for us. So, I look forward to that opportunity if it presents itself.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Right. Thanks for that. And from prior conversations, you've been real conscious of the TCE ratio, which is, call it,
7%. I guess my question is, where would that ratio need to be today before you think about share repurchase?

James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Hey, Terry. This is Jim. Certainly, it's a tool. It's a tool we're very conscious of. Clearly, the TCE ratio is in a better
spot post our partnership in Chicago. Obviously, the stock price, and we're sensitive of the earn-back. And if you
look at today's stock price, which we're very pleased to have that earn-back extend out, it's a little less attractive

to us than it once was. But I think we'll just continue to evaluate each day to see if the tool makes sense to use. At
this point in time, though, I don't think we need to rush into anything and just let the back half of the year play out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And maybe just stepping out of the earnings model, could you talk about kind of synergies in the Nashville market
between wealth and banking and vice versa, and maybe retention in that market now that the deal has been
closed for three or four months?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Let me just give you a high level view and I'll let Mark or [ph] Jim (00:25:10) jump in as well. I got to tell you, I was
just down there not too long ago and met with a bunch of different clients. We're bringing our board meeting down
there in August. And so, we're going to have a client event down there with 150 plus clients and have a chance to
interact and really talk about the future of Nashville, the future of the Southeast for us and as we just kind of
evaluate the opportunities. And I continue to be blown away by the opportunities that present themselves to us.
There obviously are no shortage of good banks that are down there, but that doesn't mean we can't go out and
compete effectively. We got a great team down there. There's just so much organic growth, which is going to
present opportunities for us. And while we've always been bullish on that opportunity, every single time we're
down there, we get reinforced that opportunities are endless with us in terms of our team members that are down
there, completely engaged, as well as the new business opportunities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Retention has been really high, Terry. And it's early, but I just would say this team is really excited to join Old
National. I think they look at the cultural fit and the capabilities that we bring to the table and they're excited about.
And so you're – the first part of your question, we haven't even begun to tap the wealth opportunities that are
there. This wasn't something that CapStar did much of, candidly, and I think we've got a really strong capability.
We've got a strong team that was already there, if you may recall. So both sides of that equation are very excited.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Chris.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Jim, any thoughts of tweaking any exposures in the back half of the year, either post deal? I mean, you don't have
a CRE problem, but there's decent liquidity for certain assets. Anything that's on the books that might not be core
going into 2025?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Well, I think all banks retain a certain amount at its balance sheet that's got flexibility around it. And well we have
– there's no specific plans for us anywhere, I think we'd need to continually look to optimize the balance sheet.
And so, we'll need to continue to look at how we're able to bring core funding in to support new growth. One
thing's for sure, we're going to continue to acquire new relationships. When those relationships are full
relationships, we have a huge appetite to continue to grow, and you can clearly see we've demonstrated that.
One of the challenges – you've followed us for a long time, one of the challenges we had in the past was our
ability to grow. That is clearly not a challenge today. We've got great markets, great people, great growth
opportunities ahead of us. So to the extent that there are non-core assets that are on the balance sheet or have
limited relationships, I think there is an opportunity for us to continue to optimize the balance sheet, but nothing
big or wholesale in nature that would dramatically change what you'd expect to see us looking like in the back half
of the year, but something we've got to continually challenge ourselves to look at.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Perfect. Maybe dovetailing on the buyback question, any change in how you're thinking about strategic
M&A into 2025? I know organic is the focus, but any change there would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I really don't see why. I think there will be plenty of opportunities that present themselves to us in the
coming years. Our appetite, I think, is I would express is very limited right now. I think just given the organic
growth opportunities, the execution that we have in our core markets and the markets we've added through talent
and obviously now in Tennessee and North Carolina, I think we owe it to ourselves and owe it to our shareholders
to continue to focus in on that. And as we've talked about previously before, the idea of compounding tangible
book value in a double-digit clip for the next few years sounds really appealing and really attractive, I think
ultimately may drive the highest reward for our shareholders.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Jon. How are you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, good. Good. Maybe start with you, John. You talked about the high 7% on new origination yields and mid-
4% funding costs. Would you say the new production is margin accretive at this point or is it margin neutral?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Margin accretive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. On the deposit costs, slide 8, I see that flat deposit cost, the 2.16% at the end of the quarter. What do you
think that looks like in a quarter or two? What's the message you're trying to send? Or has the pressure stopped?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
I think the pressure has largely moderated. I do think it's still competitive out there. And again, as long as we can
continue to do margin accretive business, we're going to stay on our front foot, right? So if you were to go out to
Old National's website today, you'd see us running specials that are very competitive. I mean, we are open for
business and we're going to fund this bank. I think that it's moderating. The worst of it is clearly behind us. Could
we see a little drift up in third quarter? Yeah, that's possible.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Tying into that, the non-interest bearing guide to 22% by the end of the year, do you feel like that's it or
does that – do you think that continues to leak lower naturally? Or do you feel like we're getting to the bottom on
that percentage?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
I think we're getting there. I think we're toward the bottom. And part of the secret sauce around here, as you
know, is just the granularity of the book, right? I mean, something like 80% of the relationships here are less than
$25,000. The average on that book is like $4,500, right. At some level, there's still probably a little bit of cash
sorting that needs to happen, but I think we're through most of it.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Okay. Okay. And then just to wrap up, do you feel like a cut or two isn't necessarily beneficial to your outlook, but
maybe just the new production is beneficial to the margin outlook? Is that a fair way to look at it or am I
misreading that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John V. Moran, IV A
Interim Chief Financial Officer & Chief Strategy Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. No, that a fair way to look at it, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
