Thomas P. Gibbons
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, Marius, and good morning everyone. Now I'm going to touch on a few of the highlights before I hand it
over to Emily and she'll review our second quarter financial results and the outlook for the second half of the year
in more detail.
So, if we refer to slide 2 of the financial highlights presentation. We reported EPS of $1.13 that's on $4 billion of
revenue and we generated a return on tangible common equity of 19%. Fee revenue was up 4% year-over-year
and it was up 10% excluding the impact of money market fee waivers. Average deposits were down 1% quarter-
over-quarter. This together with strong capital generation drove an approximately 20 basis point increase in our
Tier 1 leverage ratio. And we're pleased with the results of this year's supervisory stress tests which once again
demonstrated the resilience of our business model, and the strength of our balance sheet even under severe
stress. And we also welcome the Fed's decision to lift the recent restrictions on common stock dividends and
share repurchases at the end of June.
Now, taking a step back for a look at the broader operating environment, we continue to be impacted by the
significant amount of excess cash in the system. We welcome the Fed's decision to raise the IOER, and the
overnight reverse REPO rate by 5 basis points last month. That provided a bit of support to short term rates;
although they continue to be exceptionally low by historical standards. Money market funds' take-up of the Fed's
reverse repo facility increased from approximately $500 billion prior to the Fed's action to north of $750 billion and
they actually spiked to almost $1 trillion at quarter end. This means that somewhere between 15% and 20% of
total US money market fund assets are being parted to Fed, earning 5 basis points. Now given the significant
amount of excess cash in the system and the expectation for further Fed balance sheet expansion, bank balance
sheets will continue to be under pressure but money market funds may provide some relief.
Now, let's turn to a few highlights across the franchise, and I'll start with Asset Servicing. In Asset Servicing, we
continue to see good momentum as clients increasingly transform their operating models and they're looking to us
for open, modular, front-to-back solutions including our leading Data and Analytics solutions that they can build
their own businesses on. As an example, we were awarded new business from Lockheed Martin and it was led by
Asset Servicing, but it really leveraged our capabilities across the enterprise. We were awarded custody and a full
suite of related services, as Lockheed was looking to consolidate providers across custody and hedge funds
administration. This large corporate asset owner win demonstrates the power of our OMNI offering to bring a wide
breadth of services, which includes Data and Analytics, leading fintech partnerships and other capabilities from
across the enterprise together, which happened to differentiate us from our competitors in this process.
We also continue to drive innovation in digital assets. We are excited to have recently been mandated by
Grayscale, that's the world's largest digital currency asset manager to provide fund accounting and administrative
services for the Bitcoin Trust. Once conversion to an ETF is SEC-approved, we will be able to service the product
as an ETF as well, while also providing our unique transfer agency and ETF basket creation services. On ETF
more broadly, we continue to see good momentum in ETF servicing with ETF AUC/A reaching $1.1 trillion at the
end of June and we've now helped to launch over 100 ETFs year-to-date. We've also continued to strengthen our
capabilities through additional partnerships with leading Fintechs. In last week, we announced the acquisition of
Milestone. This acquisition will help us advance the digitization and automation of core accounting and Asset
Servicing capabilities.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
If you recall, roughly about a year ago, we formed an elite alliance with Milestone to address an industry need for
greater fund oversight and resiliency. Following on the success of this alliance, we saw an opportunity to build on
the strategic relationship and further our capabilities in OCIO services, cash allocation, and fair value controls. I'd
also like to highlight our recently announced partnerships with Saphyre and Evisort because both are terrific
examples of how we are using open architecture to automate and digitize operations, improve the client
experience and driving efficiencies.
Moving on to our Markets Infrastructure businesses â€“ Pershing had another strong quarter benefiting from equity
market strength and continued strong underlying fundamentals. The number of clearing accounts continues to
grow at a healthy clip and we saw strong net new asset flows and the sales pipeline there remains robust. In May,
we reshaped Pershing's operating model into two segments; Institutional Solutions and Wealth Solutions, and we
did that to organize around our clients and align our expertise to best serve their needs. Aligning around these
two segments enables us to focus our people, tech investments and process improvements to fuel growth.
Institutional Solutions serves capital markets firms, investment banks, hedge funds and alternative investment
managers. Pershing's institutional platform provides clients with a single seamless experience backed by the
strength and scale of BNY Mellon, offering financing, collateral management, global trade execution, securities
lending and syndicate capabilities.
Now, Wealth Solutions addresses the evolving and converging needs of our wealth-minded broker-dealer and
RIA clients by delivering improved lending, digitized account opening and streamlined asset transfers. Given the
rapid growth in the Wealth Advisory segment, we are making significant new investment to further build out our
advisory capabilities.
In Markets, we were able to offset some of the headwinds from meaningfully lower volatility and narrowing
spreads by growing our client volumes significantly, reflecting the success of the initiatives we've put in place to
strengthen our capabilities and improve client targeting across our Investment Services business. In fact, last
week, Euromoney ranked us #1 in 18 categories of its 2021 FX Survey. And for the first time, we claimed the #1
spot as "Real-Money Overall Market Leader" globally.
In Treasury Services, we saw strong growth in quarterly payment volumes compared to the prior year, and the
business experienced healthy client wins in payments, liquidity and trade across all geographic regions. In June,
we introduced cross-currency sweeps, the latest addition to our rapidly expanding liquidity management product
suite. And earlier in May, we launched the first of its kind real-time e-bill and payment solution that we talked
about in the past.
We're the first bank leveraging the New York Clearing House's Real-Time Payments network to provide
corporations with an instant digital consumer bill pay service. And today, we're actively collaborating with multiple
billers and retail banks to drive the adoption of this new functionality. Our production pilots will continue this year
and we're planning to scale them more broadly into 2022.
In Investment Management, we had our fifth consecutive quarter of net inflows into long-term products. We
continue to see strong net inflows in the cash products and we ended the quarter with record AUM. We've been
making good progress in our realignment to transfer Mellon capabilities in fixed income, equity and multi-asset
and liquidity management to Insight, Newton and Dreyfus Cash, respectively. And that was â€“ the purpose to bring
specialist investment capabilities at scale and we remain on track for completion of this in the third quarter.
We're pleased to see that we're already starting to drive efficiencies, and feedback from clients and industry
consultants has been quite positive. In last month, Euan Munro joined us as the new Head of Newton. Euan

brings three decades of experience with a proven track record in the investment industry, including extensive
experience leading one of the UK's largest asset managers with a presence in institutional, intermediary and retail
markets.
And finally, in Wealth Management, we saw another quarter of strong client asset flows and client assets
exceeded $300 billion for the first time. The Financial Times named BNY Mellon the "Best Private Bank for Digital
Wealth Planning in North America", and they're recognizing there our Wealth Online client portal and our
proprietary goals-based planning tool we call AdvicePath. Taken together, we're pleased with the increased
momentum that we're seeing across the franchise which is resulting in organic fee growth in excess of our 1.5%
outlook for the year. Our strong performance in the first half of the year and significant capital generation have put
us in a position to further accelerate investments and a number of meaningful growth and modernization
opportunities in the second half.
Now before I turn it over to Emily to review our second quarter results and the outlook for the second half of the
year in more detail, I'd like to provide a quick update on our plans for the return to the office and the future of the
workplace. Starting in September, we're planning to begin safely opening our offices around the world, although
dates and details may vary by location as we continue to monitor and as conditions evolve. We believe that in the
process we have an opportunity to create a new and better way of working that makes us feel more connected,
balanced and productive, while maintaining flexibility. The majority of our almost 50,000 colleagues around the
world â€“ will therefore follow a hybrid model that allows for a flexible mix of remote and in-person experiences
going forward.
With that, I'll hand it over to Emily.

Emily H. Portney
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. As I walk you through the details of our results for the quarter, all
comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.
Beginning on page 3, total revenue was lower by 1% due to lower net interest revenue and higher money market
fee waivers, partially offset by strong fee growth. Fee revenue grew 4%, or 10% excluding the impact of fee
waivers. This reflects the positive impact of higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker US dollar and
higher client activity. Other revenue was $91 million and included approximately $30 million of investment
disposal and other income gains. Net interest revenue was down 17%. Expenses increased 3%, with about two-
thirds driven by the weaker US dollar. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $86 million driven by an
improvement in the macroeconomic forecast. EPS was $1.13, and pre-tax margin was 32%.
Moving to page 4 which shows a trend analysis of the main drivers of our quarterly results. Investment Services
revenue was $3 billion, down 4% year-on-year, mainly driven by lower net interest revenue and higher fee
waivers. Excluding fee waivers, Investment Services fee and other revenue was up 5%, reflecting increased client
activity and organic growth in assets from existing clients, higher liquidity balances and market levels and the
benefit of the weaker US dollar.
Investment and Wealth Management revenue of $1 million (sic) [billion] increased 13%, as higher market values
and the benefit of the weaker US dollar more than offset the impact of fee waivers. Excluding fee waivers, fee and
other revenue was up 21%. Money market fee waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense, was $252
million in the quarter, up $64 million from the prior quarter, which impacted pre-tax income by approximately $40
million sequentially. Higher waivers were driven by lower T-bill and repo rates as well as higher average balances.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Turning to page 5. Our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong and well above internal targets and regulatory
minimums. Our CET1 ratio was 12.6%, flat to Q1 under the standardized approach. And our Tier 1 leverage ratio,
which is our binding capital constraint, was 6%, up approximately 20 basis points sequentially due to net capital
generation and a 2% quarter-over-quarter decrease in average asset. Average deposit balances declined by 1%,
as we've been successful at curtailing deposit growth by working with our clients to move excess deposits to off-
balance sheet vehicles, namely money market funds which were up roughly 9% sequentially outpacing the
industry. Finally, our LCR was 110%, flat to the prior quarter.
Turning to page 6. My comments on net interest revenue will highlight the sequential changes. Q2 net interest
revenue was $645 million, down 1.5%. The decrease was largely driven by the impact of lower short term rates,
continued elevated prepayment speeds and lower reinvestment yields.
Turning to page 7, which will provide some color on deposits and our securities portfolio trends and mix. As
mentioned, average deposit balances declined by a little over $3 billion sequentially, despite the Fed Act adding
$360 billion of liquidity into the system through its bond purchase program, and the Treasury General Account
having declined by about $300 billion in the quarter. Our deposits remain elevated versus a year ago, up $42
billion or 15%. We estimate that a portion of this growth is excess in nature and is expected to run off when rates
rise.
Turning to the securities portfolio. On average, the portfolio was flat to the first quarter and up approximately $7
billion or 5% over the prior year. Average loans increased about 7%, both sequentially and year-over-year with
growth primarily driven by Pershing margin loans, Wealth Management collateralized loans and capital call
financing, as well as term secured loans to global financial institutions.
Turning to page 8. As I mentioned earlier, expenses of approximately $2.8 billion for the quarter were higher by
3% versus the prior year, with about two-thirds of the increase driven by the unfavorable impact of the weaker US
dollar. The remainder was primarily driven by volume and revenue-related expenses and investments in efficiency
and growth initiatives.
Turning to page 9; total revenue in the Investment Services segment declined by 4% versus the prior year. FX
revenue in Investment Services declined 7% year-over-year, driven by lower volatility and spreads partially offset
by strong growth in client volume. On a sequential basis, FX revenue declined 21% on lower volumes especially
in emerging markets, lower spreads and volatility. Assets under custody and/or administration increased by 21%
year-over-year to $45 trillion driven by higher market levels, net new business and a favorable impact of the
weaker US dollar.
As I discuss the Investment Services businesses, I will focus my comments on total fees in each business. Within
the Asset Servicing line of business, we saw growth on the back of higher client activity and market levels which
more than offset lower FX revenue. The growth was offset by a roughly 400 basis point impact from fee waivers.
Fees in Pershing were up reflecting higher market levels and solid organic growth, partially offset by higher fee
waivers and lower transaction volumes compared to an exceptional quarter a year ago. Clearing accounts were
up 6%, mutual fund assets were up 33% and we saw continued strong net asset flows of $40 billion in the quarter.
Waivers impacted fee growth by approximately 800 basis points.
Fees in Issuer Services had underlying growth in DRs, which saw a resumption of client issuance and dividend
activity to pre-COVID levels as well as in Corporate Trust on the back of higher CLO, MTN and mortgage refi
activity. This growth was offset by the impact of fee waivers in Corporate Trust. Treasury Services fees were up
6

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
11% driven by higher payment volume and a continued shift to higher margin products. In fact, on June 30, the
business processed a record $3.2 trillion in US dollar payments.
Finally, Clearance and Collateral Management fees were down slightly as continued strength in Collateral
Management was offset by lower Clearance volumes and lower intra-day financing fees. Elevated levels of US
money fund AUM and international demand for HQLA collateral are both providing long term tailwinds for our
Collateral Management business.
Page 10 summarizes the key drivers that affect the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of our
Investment Services businesses.
Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on page 11. Total Investment and Wealth Management revenues
increased 13% versus the prior year. Assets under management grew to a record $2.3 trillion; up 18% year-over-
year primarily due to higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker US dollar principally versus the
British pound and net client inflows. We had net inflows of $25 billion in the second quarter driven by LDI, fixed
income and cash strategies. As Todd said, this is our fifth consecutive quarter of long term inflows. Investment
Management revenue grew 13% due to higher market values, the benefit of a weaker US dollar, higher
performance fees and net inflows, despite a 9% negative impact from fee waivers. Wealth Management revenue
also grew 13% due to higher market values, investment performance and growth in collateralized loans. Client
assets in Wealth Management were a record $305 billion; up 20% year-over-year.
Page 12 includes the results of the Other segment.
I'll conclude with a few comments about the outlook. As we think about the second half of 2021 based on a
current forward curve, we now expect NIR on a full year basis to be down approximately 14% compared to 2020.
Also using the forward curve and assuming flat balances, we estimate fee waivers, net of distribution and
servicing expense to be approximately $225 million in the third quarter; slightly better than the $252 million this
quarter driven by the slightly higher short-term rate outlook. This is estimated to have a modest pre-tax benefit of
$15 million next quarter. With regard to fees ex-waivers, recall that we guided at year-end for growth to be about
3%. Given the strong first half of this year, we now expect full year fees ex-waivers to be up between 7% and 8%.
On expenses; we now expect the full year to be up closer to 4% excluding notable items. Approximately half of
the year-over-year growth is expected to be related to currency and the other half is pretty evenly split over higher
volume and revenue-related expenses and incremental investments in a number of attractive growth and
efficiency opportunities. We still expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And with respect
to capital returns, our board just declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per share for the third quarter representing an
approximately 10% increase and authorized up to $6 billion of common stock repurchases over the next six
quarters through the end of 2022. Considering the $2 billion of excess capital that we've accumulated and the
significant amount of capital that we're generating, we expect to buyback well in excess of 100% of our earnings
in the near term. And remember, the SCB framework allows for additional capital actions over time, if and when
appropriate, subject to additional authorization by our board.
With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions?

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. And thanks for taking away like 17 of my questions with that outlook. That was helpful.
Can I get us a follow-up on the expense question? So if you look at year-on-year, it was up 3%, I heard your
guide. Expenses were down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Can we talk about the growth opportunities you mentioned,
what growth opportunities are you investing in and what kind of payback can we expect? How do you think about
that given your huge excess capital? My real question is why not invest more? So that's where I'm going with it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
It's a great question, Glenn. Thank you. So, as you have rightfully pointed out, we have been extraordinarily
disciplined on expenses and we've actually held them flat over the course of last four years. Everything that we're
talking about here are investments in growth and efficiency; just to name a few. So certainly digital assets and all
the things we talked about around digital assets, Data and Analytics, advisory services in Pershing as well as the
managed account space; I'd highlight also electronic payment and collection services in Treasury Services. And
then the remainder would be modernizing and automating both our risk management and our operations
infrastructure. And really, as you alluded to, we had a very strong half. We have a very strong capital-generative
model. There are interesting opportunities. All of these have been properly vetted and truly will drive incremental
growth and efficiency. So, we feel now it's an important time to invest.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Glenn, you're still there? I think we lost you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Oh yeah. Sorry about that. I appreciate all that, Emily. Maybe just a quick follow-up on Pershing. So in past, you
spoke about maybe some headwinds in the second half, are you able to quantify that, just to give us that heads
up on what to expect in the second half. And maybe at the high level, talk about the competitive backdrop there
because it seems like some â€“ yet another competitor is poking their nose in and trying to get involved on the RIA
clearing side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. I can start and I'm sure Todd can add. Just in terms of the impact of the lost business that we had, talked
about in the past, it's going to be about $20 million per quarter going forward. And that is â€“ by the way, Glenn,
baked into the forecast. So that is embedded in there. And yes it is a competitive space. And actually that
particular piece of business that we're talking about was really we were just on the wrong side of some M&A
activity. So although we see a lot of growth and a lot of opportunity, there's certainly further consolidation as well.

Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. And I would add, the consolidation that we've seen is actually a positive for us. So we've got a very robust
pipeline. We continue to add a significant number of accounts over the course of the quarter and as well as
seeing significant growth in funds. And we think there's opportunity to actually invest more.
So what we did this quarter is we actually separated the businesses into two. One is the institutional side where
we have some unique capabilities with some very large clients, and we've got some pretty good leads there that
we're excited about; but also on the advisory and the broker-dealer side, we think we can invest there and garner
some more, what's a very fast-growing industry. There is some competition there, but the consolidation has also
provided some opportunity for us. So we do get â€“ every now and then, you get a lumpy loss due to an M&A.
We've looked at over history that really â€“ it hasn't changed. We probably won more than we've lost, but we have
pointed out that will have an impact in the third quarter.

Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Research Partners
Hey, good morning. Can you speak to your efforts on deposits? It seems like you had some success keeping
deposits flat to down. Is that deliberate efforts on your part with less demand for your balance sheet? Maybe you
could just speak to the deposit growth in the quarter and how you think about it going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. I'll take that. So you're right, we have been proactively managing deposits and very successfully. We've
been working with our clients and you can see that in our trends. So despite the Fed continuing to pump excess
liquidity into the system, ultimately, we have managed our deposits and they're down 1% sequentially.
This has been very much a coordinated effort with our salespeople and our clients. And in terms of looking at
what's excess on our balance sheet, we probably think we have about $25 billion to $50 billion that's still excess.
But what we have been doing is looking at what is excess and actually working with our clients to move it to off
balance sheet vehicles such as money market funds. That's partially why you see a 9% growth in our money
market fund balances that were driving waivers.
And we're fortunate, too, in that we have a very robust liquidity solutions business. We offer both in-house as well
as third-party solutions and that has been certainly very attractive to our clients as we've endeavored to manage
the balance sheet. And look, going forward, we will continue to do that. We're comfortable where we are, but
certainly we will continue to do that considering there will likely be more liquidity coming into the system.

Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Jim, it's a very disciplined process that Emily leads along with the salespeople and treasury function. And we look
at it client-by-client. And the good news is we've been able to capture most of that in our money market funds or
our LiquidityDirect offerings, and so we are gaining market share there. And we've got a little bit of benefit when
the Fed did increase the interest rate on excess reserves and the reverse repo that made that alternative. They've
provided a bit of an outlet. So we think even though the Fed will probably continue to provide liquidity and build
their balance sheet, that we should be able to manage it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Research Partners
Right. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up to that, if you think you've had success on the leverage ratio,
when we think about the buyback that you're targeting over the next 18 months, can you frontload that? How do
we think about the cadence of buybacks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. Emily?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So certainly, the cadence of buybacks is going to be determined by lots of different factors. Our capital
position, our forward outlook for earnings, et cetera, but you can definitely assume that considering we have
about $2 billion of excess capital now, and that's just against our binding constraint of Tier 1 leverage, frankly, we
have more excess capital when you actually think about what a normalized balance sheet size probably is when
some of those excess deposits recede. So assuming â€“ taking that into account, taking into account the fact that
we've also committed to our shareholders that we will return 100% of earnings over time, it's safe to assume that
we'll probably frontload that $6 billion of authorization that we've received from the board.

Hey thanks. Good morning, everybody. So maybe just starting with the NIR guide for the back half, it looks like
the amount continues to kind of grind lower a little bit and maybe given what the forward curve has done relative
to last quarter, not particularly surprising, but curious if you guys feel like the most of the pain is now in the run
rate. Is this the right sort of jumping off point to think about as we sort of start to pencil that into 2022?

Sure. So I hesitate to call a trough because every time we do, it's not accurate. But in terms of just our outlook, we
just use the forward curve when we project NIR. We don't try to get cute. Short term rates are a bit lower in the
forward curve than they were a couple of months ago. Likewise, as you all have seen the long end has come
down and the curve is flattening. And likewise in terms of prepayment speeds, they have been elevated. And
although we do expect them to slow down by the end of the year, they're probably going to still be more elevated
than we had originally anticipated; so all of those things are just baked into the 14% down year-on-year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. A couple of things. I mean, one of the key drivers are the short term rates, when you look at LIBORs and
obviously when you look at the Fed funds rate or the IOER. So the fact that that has stabilized and it stabilized a
bit in the forward curve at least out the next six months or so. So, the downside drag to that from where we are is
probably not likely to be much unless something else were to change. And then we're going to have to look at the
impact of term rates as we do re-price assets as they come out of the investment portfolio, but our best guess
right now is we're pretty close to the trough. And as we think through money market fee waivers, it does feel like
the support in the reverse repo program has probably bottomed that out.

Great. That's helpful. Thank you. I was hoping to dig through a couple of business line items as well; maybe just
focusing on Asset Servicing for a second. It seems like the business is seeing pretty decent momentum here
when I, sort of, back out money market fee waivers from the asset servicing line. It looks like it was up 2%
quarter-on-quarter, 7% year-over-year, so despite obviously moderating industry volumes backdrop. Can you help
us bridge maybe what sort of the sources of growth here are sequentially? And as we're sort of thinking ahead
over the next sort of 12 months to 18 months, what do you expect to be the bigger contributors to growth here? I
know there's a bunch of things that go in there, right? There's the custody and admin business, but then there's
also tri-party repo and a couple of other things.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. So let me start with the more traditional custody business. I think we're having quite a bit of success there.
We've won a couple of very nice mandates this year. Our sales growth is ahead of where it's been. The ETF
business is growing very nicely. It's up significantly on a year-over-year basis. Our capabilities there are quite
good. In our venture with CIBC Mellon, we've actually won 11 of the 16 ETFs that have been listed on the TSE,
and so we're seeing healthy growth there. And we've got about 100 opportunities in our digital asset space. So
that is getting some traction. And we've got really good flows across a number of our existing â€“ organic flows with
our existing clients. So it's a combination of all of that, Alex.

Operator: Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to start with the balance sheet. You touched on the
estimate of excess deposits that was really helpful. Thanks for that, Emily. Curious about what drove though on
the funding cost side, the improvement quarter-over-quarter. Was there any noise in that? Or do you think that's
sustainable? And then when we think about squaring the guide for balances, what are you assuming for deposit
growth from here for the rest of the year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So just on the funding side, really, there was a benefit of also lower rates there. So, that was what was
driving it. Nothing else really notable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. A lot of our debt is swap to floating. So as we saw lower LIBORs, we saw that through that as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Exactly. And then I think the other question was the â€“ what was the second part of the question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Balance sheet growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Oh, balance sheet growth, yeah. As similar to what I had alluded to before, we will continue to monitor and
proactively manage the balance sheet. We do have room should deposits go up further, but of course like I said,
based on the excess that we have, we'd like to kind of stay where we are and frankly manage it down further.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And then when we think about servicing â€“ the servicing revenue and Alex touched on this a little,
what was the contribution of activity this quarter? What was the benefit of new business? Was there some â€“ did
that come in late in the quarter from a â€“ I know we â€“ it's an imperfect way to model, but the way we all model this,
it looks like the fee rate got hit this quarter. So what were some of the dynamics there? And how should we be
thinking about that going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
I mean, if you're talking about like asset servicing versus AUC/A, which I think is kind of what you're alluding to,
AUC/A was up 8% sequentially. About one-third of that was market and currency driven and the remainder was
really organic growth; so some really good kind of organic growth. When you look at that though against asset
12


The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
(BK) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
servicing fees and revenues, like when we think about it, it's generally helpful rather than look at the 8% to
probably look at the spot â€“ sorry, rather than look at the spot at the average growth in AUC/A which was about
5%. And then when you look at the asset servicing fee line, it was flat, but ex-waivers was up 2%. And actually as
we've kind of reminded folks in the past, when we look, asset servicing fees only 50% or so are truly driven by
asset levels. The remainder are driven by account-based fees and transaction fees. So hopefully, that helps.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. When you get under it all, if you look at really what is the organic growth rate underneath â€“ across the
businesses, especially in the Investment Services business, when we look at fees only if you exclude market
appreciation or depreciation and the currency impact waivers and some of the extraordinary volumes that we had
in the second quarter of last year due to COVID, if you net that out and net the fee waivers out, we're seeing
probably something like 2% or slightly better than 2% in the core organic growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for that color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning. Emily, on the fee side, ex-waivers, you talked about the improvement on your outlook
to 7%, 8% from 3%. And I'm just wondering how much of that was just a pull-through of the first half, as you
mentioned? Or if you are actually more confident in what you're seeing in some of the core businesses following
on the last few questions about the underlying growth that you are seeing in other fee areas?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So ultimately the 7% to 8% is fees ex-waiver growth over the course of â€“ will be year-on-year. So, you have
some of the numbers to do the math. In the first half, we had about 8% growth. In the second half, it will still be
very, very healthy but probably closer to 7%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. All right. So it was more of the just how good it's been and then stays is the way to think about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Exactly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. And just Todd, coming back to â€“ you laid out a lot of new product intros, you've been talking about
this for a while. I guess the challenge for us is to understand how these product intros turn into revenues and the
timeframe by which they do convert. And you've talked about the organic growth improving directionally over time,
13


The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
(BK) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
but how quickly can we start to see some of these improvements and new intros really starting to roll into the
income statement? And are there other ones that you can give examples of, where they're live and now starting to
be meaningful contributors? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure, Ken. So, as we described in the past, if you looked at our organic growth over the past few years before last
year, it was basically flat. And so now we're starting to get some traction as we've improved a number of our
services, invested in our Data and Analytics capabilities and we've talked about our digital assets capability. So
we're already starting to see some benefit in these numbers now that we're seeing an underlying growth rate
more like 2%. We're already starting to see some benefit to things like our custody and ETF servicing business
around some of the digital assets. Our investments in the ETF business is starting to come through and show up
in the numbers a bit. Some of the longer term investments that we're looking to make, like Pershing, where we're
really investing in the platform, we don't expect that to really turn into revenues for as long as two years. So some
of these are longer term and some of them are coming through as we talk about them.
On the Treasury Services side, where you see us gaining some market share and we've had pretty healthy
organic growth there, the multi-currency sweeps, it's caught a lot of attention when we announced that. We have
clients in it today and we think that will gain some traction over the next year or so. And I would say the same
thing with what we're doing with real-time payments and collections. So we've mapped it out. It's kind of all over
the board. Some of them are as far as two years or three years out. Some of the investments that we're making in
custody, we would expect to have a return maybe a year out. And some of them are starting to bump into and
help us generate a positive organic growth rate of the 2% that we're seeing today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. Just want to come back to the AUC/A, up to $45 trillion from the $41.7 trillion.
You mentioned about two-thirds of that was organic. Can you parse that out a bit between organic from the client
base in terms of net inflows at your clients? It seems like $2 trillion's a large number, so, I just wanted to sort of
understand new business won by BNY Mellon versus the underlying client growth.
And then if you can also comment on the demand for cryptocurrency servicing, obviously, the Grayscale
mandate, which is great. Are you seeing an increase in that demand in the second quarter versus what â€“ I know
that began to spike up in the first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. So Brian, when you look at our flows and the growth on a year-over-year basis, about half of it is flows that
would include net new â€“ new business and it would also include any lost business and any organic flows from
existing clients. So, hooking on some winners as they generate new funds, that would be new business for us.
And then the combination â€“ a little more than half is market and currency, and the rest of it is coming from the
client flows.

I'm sorry. I meant on a sequential basis from $41.7 trillion to the $45 trillion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. On a sequential basis, that number is â€“ it's pretty similar. It's probably...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Actually, a bit more. On the sequential basis, it's about â€“ more of it is based on net new business than currency
and markets than it was a year-on-year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. It's about 50-50. Not quite...

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
And then you asked a question around demand for Bitcoin services. We've mentioned earlier we have initiated
quite a few ETFs in Canada where they can be traded on the TSC. So we've got 11 of the 16 ETFs that exist
there and there is activity there. And Grayscale, which is the largest asset manager of digital currencies, we've
teamed up and partnered with them, both to help them with the existing trust; and when and if they get approval
from the SEC to list the ETFs, they'll take on our TA and other capabilities there as well. So, we are seeing some
interest.
And then we're also seeing some interest on the â€“ what I'd say the high net worth side. So there is some retail
interest that we're hearing through some of the Pershing clients as well as other wealth management players.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
It's worth just adding to that, that we have been mandated on the 6 of the 13 filings for the [indiscernible]

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay. That's great. And then just a quick follow-up on the assumptions for NIR and the money market fund
fee waivers. You mentioned trying to move more of those excess deposits into money market funds. Just in the
assumptions of the guidance that you gave, are you assuming some of that transfer from those excess deposits in
terms of both the fee waivers moving down, which would be good, if you were expecting an increase in money
market fund balances? And then same with the balance sheet side as we move into year-end given that
guidance, is there an assumption of conversion of deposits to money market fund balances within that guidance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. I'll take both and I'm sure Todd will chime in. On the waiver side, really we're just using the forward curve
and we're just assuming balances stay flat. As we talked about before, the Fed actually taking some action with
technical rates and raising the reverse repo rate by 5 basis points has been extraordinarily helpful, and that has
put a bit of a floor in terms of gross fund yield. And so that is largely what's driving the improvement that we
expect in the second quarter from a run rate of about â€“ what was $250 million this quarter to about $225 million.
So in terms of going forward, of course, as we start to recoup some of that, it's very dependent upon, obviously, it
will be very dependent upon balance levels but that's going to be sometime in the future.
From a deposit perspective, where as I mentioned before, we have a material amount of excess still on the
balance sheet, we're fine in terms of where we are, but yes, we'd like to manage that down a bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So Brian, what I would add to that is â€“ so yeah, we're projecting that those balances are going to come down a
little bit in the number for NIR. And you got to remember; when we had all this excess capital and there was
nothing we can do about it, it wasn't particularly in our interest to push those balances away because they did
make â€“ even though it was modest, they did make a little bit of incremental income but the return on capital was
very poor.
So now that we have the flexibility to manage our capital base through the new regime, we'd very much want to
be much more efficient with the usage of the balance sheet. Now, we didn't try to marry that with how much â€“ if
the balance sheet comes down, how much of that is going to come into fee waivers. And remember, if we are
growing the money market funds, we're waiving a pile of the fees as well. So fee waivers go up a little bit, even
though there is some net benefit to us from that. We didn't try to solve that in the guidance that we gave you, we
just made it simple. But it's not going to be a material number.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow up on a couple of the business lines you called out, particularly
noticed that Issuer Services and Treasury Services performed well. You mentioned some of the drivers,
particularly, the new product in Treasury Services, but wondering how sustainable you think the growth rates seen
in this quarter are going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I think we continue to see as we continue to invest in our payments platform and volumes are moving
nicely and we're capturing a little bit of market share. As we look out, we think it's sustainable that we can see
some decent growth and we're introducing some new products that are getting some take-up. So the real-time
payments for collections is going to be a very interesting product and we've got a pretty robust pipeline for that.
We look forward to announcing something in the not-too-distant future around opportunities there. And so I think
the team has done a good job of capturing that high margin business. I think the sales effort globally has been
strong. And I think we're well-positioned to be a provider of services around the globe. We've got great
relationships and I think we're benefiting from that. So I think there's a little bit of room for continued growth there.
When you look at Issuer Services that includes Corporate Trust as well as the DR business. Corporate Trust,
we've made good inroads in the CLO business. Frankly, a few years ago, we lost a little market share. We're
capturing that. We've rebuilt our platform there, and then very good growth in conventional debt servicing. And
DRs, they were very much impacted by COVID. And so now that we're seeing some of these global companies
paying dividends again we're seeing a little more activity there and so I think there's room to sustain where we are
and grow a bit off of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
And just two quick things I'd add. In the Treasury Services space, it's a very fragmented market. So it's ultimately
â€“ even a little bit of share gain actually moves the needle considerably. And in DR, as Todd alluded to, just the
third quarter tends to be seasonally our best quarter. We had a very strong second quarter again, as Todd alluded
to, with the resumption of dividends and certainly issuance activity. So the step up will probably be a little bit less
in the third quarter.

Good morning. Just a quick question on your margins; so your Investment Servicing margin was 34%; curious if
you can provide any color on the pre-tax margins of the various LOBs within there? So, for example, I think
several years ago you spoke about Issuer Services and Treasury Services being higher margin.

Okay. Rajiv, we don't disclose the operating margins across the various businesses and we did benefit in that
margin obviously from the reserve release because a lot of that is related to it, but we did see a little bit of
underlying margin improvement, but the operating margins of the various businesses, most of them are similar to
what we see across the total, for example, Clearance and Collateral is a bit higher.
