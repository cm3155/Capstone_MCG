Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our third quarter. We delivered good core
performance and made enormous progress with the TCF integration. Let me begin on slide 3, thanks to the hard
work of our colleagues, we're on track to complete the TCF integration as planned and deliver the resulting deal
economics. This combination adds scale, density, new markets and new specialty businesses.
At the core of Huntington, we are a purpose-driven company, with a vision to build the leading people first
digitally-powered bank in the nation. We remain focused on our core objectives to drive organic growth and to
deliver sustainable top quartile financial performance.
On slide 4, our third quarter performance included a full-quarter benefit from TCF and record total revenue. We
delivered good growth in fee income, [ph] net (00:02:22) loan growth, excluding PPP and improving credit metrics.
Just over a week ago, we successfully completed the conversion of TCF to Huntington Systems, and we now
offer an integrated set of products, capabilities and experiences to our customers. As a result of the great efforts
of our colleagues, we were able to complete the conversion in just 10 months since the announcement of the
transaction.

We've completed most of the actions to drive our targeted cost synergies and are on track to deliver all of the
announced cost reductions. With the conversion behind us, we're now able to focus thousands of colleagues on
new business development activities to close up here strong and carry that momentum into 2022.
We are investing in these revenue producing colleagues as well as new capabilities in the expanded markets.
We're seeing substantial momentum in many of our initiatives, including targeted areas of fee revenue generation
like wealth and capital markets, as well as cards and payments. Both consumer and commercial loan production
continue to be robust and commercial pipelines are up over 30% from a year ago, and new production activity has
nearly doubled.
Additionally, we were pleased to be ranked number 1 nationally for the SBA 7(a) lending by volume, marking the
fourth consecutive year we've been recognized in the top spot. As the recovery continues, we will dynamically
manage our overall expense base and look for ways to drive incremental efficiencies across the bank. We intend
to self-fund the investment capacity necessary for strategic initiatives that will drive additional revenue growth in
the years ahead.
Our strategy is centered on supporting customers banking where and when they want and meeting them through
their preferred channel. As part of that strategy, we are continually optimizing our distribution network. We will be
consolidating 62 branches in the first quarter of 2022 equal to 6% of the combined branch network. And these are
in addition to the 188 branch closures announced as part of the TCF transaction.
Importantly, we will continue to retain the number one share of branches in both Ohio and Michigan. In addition to
branch consolidations, we are continuing to diligently optimize roles and resources within the bank. We're
committed to delivering positive operating leverage, as we did annually for a decade leading up to 2021. Finally,
on the capital front, we accelerated our share repurchase in the quarter as well as announced an increase to the
quarterly dividend. These actions demonstrate our confidence in the performance and outlook for Huntington, as
well as our commitment to our shareholders to actively manage our capital levels.
Slide 5 provides an update on the TCF integration. When we announced the transaction, we saw strong potential
for expense synergies as we leverage the benefits of scale, but to also drive additional organic growth. And today,
I can say that we've been more excited about the revenue opportunities in front of us.
The combination of new growth markets and increased density, the addition of more than one and a half million
customers and expanded specialty capabilities collectively set up our future revenue growth. Let me share a
couple of the most compelling aspects. In middle market and in corporate banking, we're now bringing greater
scale in Chicago, Milwaukee, in addition to new capabilities in the Twin Cities and Denver, with expanded
coverage and product offerings.
We're already gaining traction with early wins, including capital markets and treasury management fees. In
consumer and business banking, we're deploying Huntington's capabilities, products and services across the
entire customer base following conversion. Combined with our Fair Play philosophy, this will greatly enhance the
customer experience and, as we've demonstrated previously, will accelerate customer acquisition and improve
retention. And with Huntington's digital and competitive product set, we will deepen our customer relationships.
Additionally, we are bringing award-winning SBA lending platform and growing our wealth and private banking
customer base in our newly expanded markets. Our investments are well timed as we're seeing continued robust
economic recovery in our footprint. Our regions have seen economic activity expand year-to-date faster than the
national average, as well as higher labor force participation. We see a unique moment in time to capitalize on

these revenue opportunities as our local economies continue to perform very well. We are entering a new era at
Huntington, with momentum, and we look forward to growth in the years ahead.
Zach, over to you provide more details on our financial performance.

Zachary J. Wasserman
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 6, we reported GAAP earnings per common share
of $0.22 for the third quarter, which included acquisition expenses of $234 million. Earnings per common share
adjusted for these notable items were $0.35. Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE came in at 11.5% for
the quarter. Adjusted for the acquisition-related notable items, ROTCE was 17.9%. As we expected and
consistent with guidance we provided in September, we were pleased to see loan balances ex PPP grow in the
third quarter, driven by robust new production.
With continued strong liquidity, we're actively managing the balance sheet and have grown the securities portfolio
by $3.7 billion from the end of the second quarter. Deposit balances were reduced by $847 million as a result of
the branch divestiture. Excluding the divestiture, deposit balances remained relatively stable on a period-end
basis. Loans associated with the divestiture totaled $209 million.
Fee income was another bright spot, where we saw continued momentum in our capital markets, cards and
payments, treasury management, and wealth and investment businesses. As Steve noted, we've been actively
managing our capital and we're pleased to complete $500 million of share repurchases in the third quarter. We
also announced a $0.05 increase to the common stock dividend in the fourth quarter, which takes us to an
annualized dividend rate of $0.62 per share. Finally, credit quality continued to improve, with net charge-offs of 20
basis points, while non-performing assets decreased to 12% from the prior quarter.
Turning to slide 7, period-end loan balances totaled $110.6 billion. Excluding PPP, loan balances increased by
$367 million during the quarter, with underlying growth in C&I, mortgage, auto and RV/marine portfolios. On the
commercial side, while PPP and auto dealer floor plan balances were lower, all other C&I loans increased by net
$466 million during the quarter, driven by growth in asset finance and core C&I.
We're seeing very encouraging trends from new commercial loan production and pipelines that continue to grow
both year-over-year and sequentially. Consumer growth was somewhat offset by marginal pressure from the
continued run off of the home equity portfolio. Additionally, we continued to observe solid activity levels in our
consumer portfolios with residential mortgage, RV/marine and automobile, all continuing to post sequential
quarter balance growth.
Auto saw its strongest third quarter for production activity to-date, while mortgage continued to see robust
origination activity in the quarter. Excluding PPP, we believe the trough for underlying loan balances is behind us
and we expect continued modest growth from these levels in the fourth quarter. With respect to commercial
portfolio specifically, we expect to see momentum accelerate as we move through the fourth quarter and
throughout 2022.
Moving on to slide 8, as noted previously, total deposit balances, excluding the divestiture, were relatively stable.
We continue to optimize funding given our strong liquidity levels and reduced higher cost CDs by $395 million.
Overall, we continued to see much of the excess liquidity remain fairly sticky as core commercial deposit balances
increased during the quarter.

Turning to slide 9, FTE net interest income increased, primarily driven by the full-quarter benefit of TCF. Net
interest income increased by $323 million while net interest margin was 2.9%, both driven by the acquired TCF
assets. Excess liquidity moderated slightly during the quarter, with $8.1 billion of cash at the Fed at quarter end.
On an average basis for the quarter, excess liquidity represented a drag on margin of approximately 23 basis
points.
Core interest income, excluding PPP and accretion, was $1,085 million. We expect core net interest income to
grow from these levels on an absolute dollar basis in the fourth quarter and throughout 2022. We're positioned to
be asset sensitive today, and we are dynamically managing the balance sheet to become increasingly asset
sensitive to capture the benefit from expected future higher interest rates. This includes the heads roll-offs as well
as the addition of pay fixed swaps.
On June 30, our modeled net interest income asset sensitivity in an up 100 basis points scenario was 2.9%.
Based on the deliberate actions we took during the quarter, we increased our asset sensitivity to 4.0% and we
continue to dynamically manage the balance sheet going forward. Over the course of the quarter, we terminated
select downside rate protection hedges and added $6 billion of forward pay fixed swaps.
Turning to slide 10, non-interest income increased, primarily driven by the addition of TCF fee income. Several of
our businesses performed quite well within the quarter. Cards and payments benefited from higher customer
transaction volumes. Mortgage banking performed well due to higher production and relatively higher saleable
spreads and wealth and investment continued to be driven by positive net asset flows. Capital markets income
also grew, driven by solid performance in interest rate derivatives, foreign exchange and syndications.
Turning to slide 11, total non-interest expense came in at approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter, including the
$234 million of notable items. Excluding these items, non-interest expense totaled $1.05 billion, primarily driven
by the full quarter of TCF expenses. Our overall outlook for the magnitude of expense reductions is unchanged
from prior guidance.
The timing to realize these benefits, however, has accelerated due to our actions to drive realization of cost
savings. As a result, we continue to expect that while Q3 was the high watermark for core expenses, we should
benefit earlier than we previously thought as they stepped down into the fourth and first quarters. Core expenses
on an absolute dollar basis should trail down throughout 2022 as we recognize the benefits of the TCF cost
synergies while continuing to invest in the initiatives that drive top line revenue growth.
Slide 12 highlights our well capitalized balance sheet as well as a few highlights from the recent capital return
actions. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.6%, well within our medium term 9% to 10% operating
guideline. Over the past quarter, we focused on returning capital to our shareholders in alignment with our capital
priorities. We executed over half of the $800 million share repurchase program following the authorization as they
noted, and we are pleased to have recently announced an increase to the common stock dividend.
As you can see on slide 13, our quarter-ending allowance for credit losses represented 1.99% of total loans, down
from 2.08% at prior quarter end. The improved economic outlook and our stable credit quality resulted in a
reserve release of $117 million for the third quarter. Additional key credit quality metrics are shown on slide 14,
further reflecting our improving credit profile.
Net charge-offs represented an annualized 20 basis points of average loans and leases, most of the lowest levels
in recent history, well below our target range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points on average through the cycle.
Consumer charge-offs remained low in this quarter of 7 basis points with net recoveries in auto, home equity, RV

and marine. Our NPA ratio declined 12% as portfolios continue to perform as expected and the ACL coverage of
NPAs increased to 247%.
Finally, turning to our outlook on slide 15 as we operate in a dynamic macro-environment, we're focused on
managing what we can control. We remain committed to investing in our people-first digitally-powered strategy,
driving sustained revenue growth while managing expenses within our long-term commitment to positive
operating leverage and achieving a 17% return on tangible common equity.
We expect a peer group leading efficiency ratio and a normalized effective tax rate of 18% to 19%. We believe
these key metrics, revenue growth, return on capital and annual positive operating leverage are a compelling set
of financial performance indicators and closely aligned with value creation for our shareholders.
Now let me turn it back over to Tim, so we can get your questions.

Thank you, Zach. We'll, now take questions. We ask that, as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one
question and one related follow-up, and then, if that person has additional questions, they can add themselves
back into the queue. Thank you. Operator, let's open up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
Please proceed.

Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Good morning, Scott.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning, guys. Hey, thanks for taking the question. Zach, I was hoping maybe there might be a way to
put, sort of, a finer point on the degree to which you might expect costs to come down in future quarters from this
quarter's roughly $1.05 billion core base. You, of course, mentioned the acceleration, just trying to get a sense for,
sort of, the core investment spending minus the cost saves? And then along the lines of acceleration, sort of,
when do we think that cost savings will be 100% baked into the results?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, yeah, thanks, Scott. Great question. Overall, as I noted in my prepared remarks just really, really pleased
with our delivery of the cost synergies and the trajectory. And I'm not going to give you specific guidance, but I
would say that we do expect sequential reduction each quarter and for the next couple of quarters for that to be a
larger amount in the double-digit millions is likely the level you could think about. But in the end, what I would
point you to is the overall expense guidance that I've given, which is net of the cost synergies and the investments
that we're making to self-fund those revenue synergy investments and to generally drive the revenue growth

across the business. So slightly more front-loaded, driving sequential growth throughout the balance of the next
five quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Thank you, and then maybe switching gears just a bit. You sound pretty constructive on overall lending
momentum. I was curious if you could maybe let us know, sort of, how that translates into aggregate – sort of an
aggregate outlook for ex-PPP loan growth. I think previously you guys have been saying underlying loans kind of
flattish through the remainder of the year and then they grow thereafter. Does the more constructive tone suggest
maybe we get a little more growth sooner?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. It's a great question. Let me elaborate a bit more. I think as we talked at the Barclays Investor Conference
in September, I noted I expect to see some modest growth between then and the end of Q3, and that's ultimately
what we deliver and we're really pleased with that. I would characterize the growth we're expecting for Q4 as well
to be modest. So we do expect growth likely modest. I think it's really driven by the continuation of the factors
we've seen over the last several quarters and we noted a bit in the prepared remarks. That is really strong calling
activity and pipelines driving continued robust new production in commercial and quite a bit of momentum in
business banking and then in the consumer space, continued strength in residential mortgage and auto and
RV/marine continued to perform pretty well also.
The other thing I would say is now that we have the conversion behind us that we've got – we're able to now
focus thousands of colleagues on growth. And so we do expect the modest growth as we go into Q4 and then
continuing and frankly, accelerating as we go out throughout the course of next year as well.

of that stick around as we think about just the overall expense on rate?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. It's a great question, Ebrahim. I think Q4 should remain relatively elevated similar to the levels we've seen
overall – taking a step back, overall, our outlook for the merger-related costs that we guided back in December at
the time of the announcement was $890 million. And we continue to expect it to be relatively near that level. So I
think that the timing of that we've seen in more than $500 million at this point through this quarter. And so we'll
see a bit more come in Q4. And then likely a last bit in Q1, perhaps a tiny bit trailing into Q2 and then by the end
of Q2, they essentially should be done.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess just shifting to, with the TCF integration, sort of, nearing an end. Steve, strategically, I mean,
you've been an acquisitive bank. We're hearing some concerns around just the regulatory stance around deal
making getting tough. Just give us a sense of what your priorities are from a capital deployment? Is M&A still a
piece of the puzzle in terms of how you think about growing the bank?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, Ebrahim, we've done two larger bank combinations in 12 years. So I don't really think the characterization is
apt. But beyond that, as we've said before, our focus is on driving the core performance. We think we have
tremendous revenue upside here. We've got greenfield opportunities for a number of businesses in Denver and
certainly, the Twin Cities we've got a scale that we've never had in Chicago. Frankly, we've got density in
Michigan. That's significant to us. So we're very focused on driving revenue and getting the benefits of that part of
the combination equation.
We've done a few non-bank things in the past. I'd say, more likely over the next years, possibly to do some of
that. But our focus, our entire focus is on driving the core.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good morning. Can you remind us how much relative gearing you have to the short versus long end
of the curve and how you think about performance in an environment, where the short end rises perhaps a bit
faster than the long end?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. First of all, thanks for your question, Bill. This is Zach. We're most sensitive to the two to four-year range
within the yield curve to give you a sense. And look, I think, we're going to benefit here as rates move up
irrespective of the steepening. But certainly, we'd appreciate it, if that two to four-year range continue to move up

as it has been doing and it's in our continued expectation. And we're positioning to benefit from that as I noted in
some of my prepared remarks by driving incremental asset sensitivity.
And to give you a sense, the average duration of our current, down-size hedging portfolio is 1.5 years versus the
almost 5 years for the duration of our pay-fixed swaps at a little benefit as rates start to rise. So, I think we're
positioned now in the quarter by more than a point of asset sensitivity, as I noted, and we'll look to be dynamic to
improve that even as we go forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks, Zach. That's super helpful. And following up on that, as you look ahead to higher short rates and better
loan growth as utilization rates normalize, how comfortable are you with the rate at which you've been reducing
the amount of liquidity that you have parked at the Fed? And then, as we look ahead over the next few quarters, I
guess should we expect you to continue to grow the securities portfolio from here? Just curious about the extent
to which you'd consider preserving liquidity through the rest of this year just based on the outlook?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. It's a terrific question, and it's certainly something that we watch very, very carefully. I would say, full stop,
we feel great about our liquidity levels and we think we're managing exceptionally well. But the cash – the Fed is a
key area that we watch very, very carefully. And so we're – I would say I would characterize our approach as
intentionally incremental, watching the behaviors in our clients and deposit holding activities and seeking to, kind
of, optimize incrementally period-by-period as more information comes out.
As we've guided for a couple of quarters now, we expect it to add to the securities portfolio and I think last quarter
we mentioned a number of $4 billion, we completed that during the third quarter. We'll see where it goes from
here. If liquidity trends continue as we expect, I also expect that we will add some additional securities in the
fourth quarter. We're currently at about 22% securities as a percentage of assets and we'd be comfortable if that
rose modestly over time here, given the acceptable returns we're seeing and the fact that it's accretive to NIM
versus holding that cash. But as you noted, the priority is funding growth. And so we'll, as I said, take a very much
incremental approach watching both trends.

Hi, Ken.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
In terms of the core NIM, I know there is a bit of confusion around why your guidance was or wasn't, if we did our
math right where I think your core NIM just ex the PAA is about 2.81%, which is a fair bit lower than 2.90%, that I
think we were sort of shooting for. Can you just talk about, I guess, two things. So, one, what drove, sort of, the
weaker NIM ex the PAA, but also how do you think about that core NIM on a go-forward basis? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ken. So, fully reported NIM came in at 2.90% and excluding PAA, as you
noted, it was 2.81%. So, it was a few basis points lower than we expected? My prior guidance had been just a few
basis points lower than 2.90% and it came in ultimately at 2.81%. So, a bit lower than that. The two biggest
drivers of that were the things we just talked about in the last question actually, interestingly elevated Fed cash,
contributed several basis points additional drag in the quarter than we had previously expected, and we did
accelerate the purchase of our securities, which also impacted the mix and drove yields lower. Generally spreads
were, sort of, spot on our expectation [ph] overall (00:27:33) at the core low level.
Look, I think what I would tell you is, going forward, I'm expecting stable from these levels. It will be a function of
what happens with the elevated liquidity and Fed cash and the rate environment, but generally stable from these
levels is a fair assumption. And our key focus at this point is trying to drive net interest income dollars at $1,085
million of net interest income, excluding PAA, excluding PPP, given the sequential loan growth that we're
projecting, given that rate stability, my expectation is we're going to grow those dollars into Q4 and grow them
throughout 2022.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay, perfect. And then just in terms of the 62 branch closures that you talked about in first quarter, that's
all wrapped up into your expense guidance. I just want to make sure that we're not – we shouldn't take the
expense guidance plus anything else because that's just part of the outlook, correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
You're spot on, Ken. So as Steve noted in his prepared remarks, we continue to optimize the network,
dynamically manage expenses and ensure that we can invest to capture those really powerful revenue synergies.
And overall, the guidance we gave on expenses is net of all those things. And ultimately, what this is all driving
toward is achieving our moderate term financial targets that we talked about over time, the 17% return on capital,
the revenue growth accelerating, positive operating leverage to drive to that in the second half of 2022.

Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Steven, great question. This is Steve. This is a funny quarter because of the holidays interrupting. So we'll have
very good asset finance origination, but we've had a substantial effort around the conversion. We've had 800
ambassadors out in our different business lines for a couple of weeks. We pulled in at, sort of, peak production
moments. A lot of the talent, the focus on making sure we got a great conversion and we think we did. So it's
harder to do new business between the Thanksgiving and year end, if it's not already in the pipeline. So we're
talking about another three, three and a half, four weeks max for the pipeline.
Now, the pipelines are up. As we indicated, they're up year-over-year, they're up quarter-over-quarter
sequentially. So that's contributing to the bullishness but it's an odd quarter to be driving. We're very optimistic
about how this will translate then for full year 2022 as we go forward. We have some great capabilities that have
come to us with TCF. And we've already put in place much of the management and a number of the RMs and
other revenue producers that we were looking to do in the Twin Cities, in Denver and increasingly in Chicago. So
the pieces are coming together very nicely and ahead of schedule and that's also contributing to the optimism.

Okay. That's helpful. And Steve, for my follow-up, we all know Huntington scores really well from a client
satisfaction view. Did the branch consolidations have a notable negative impact on satisfaction levels? And how
long do you think it'll take to move TCF below peer client satisfaction up to Huntington's level? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Just the sheer amount of activity has required substantial efforts and resources during the course of the year. So
we would expect to see a very modest decline in customer set. And frankly, we could be flat, but we wouldn't
expect to see an increase. With respect to the TCF, the new branches from TCF and our colleagues who are new
from TCF, they are embracing Fair Play and the product set. What we saw during the conversion was just
outstanding efforts with our customers. And so we're very encouraged. It will take maybe a couple of quarters, but
12

it won't take a couple of years in order to get that customer service level at an equivalency in those newer
branches. We're very, very pleased. We got a great group of colleagues who have joined us from TCF.

I know you've given your expectations here, you've indicated your expectation for continued positive operating
leverage. How do you think about that for 2022? Maybe if you can help us with the magnitude, I know you're not
specifically guiding on the top line or expense growth expectation, but maybe if you can help us with the
magnitude of positive operating leverage on a core basis that you think is reasonable for next year? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. John, thanks for the question. And you're done with your question and I will have to repeat to that I'm not
going to give you specifics guidance, but I will try to characterize to answer your question. I think next year's
financials are going to be challenging to look at from a year-over-year growth perspective and to some degree to
calculate that metric just given the continued two quarters of grow-over impact of adding the TCF business.
But we do expect full-year positive operating leverage in total. And the big thing that we're very focused on is
driving to the point where the momentum coming into the second half of the year and it's certainly exiting the year
is on the levels that we've targeted for those moderate term targets. And so, at that point, as we sort of get into a
clean year-over-year growth period to be able to see it better.

And look, I think we'll be dynamic as we always have been to ensure that we can modulate the expenses given
where revenue is trending. We'll continue to invest and might [ph] potentially (00:34:23) we'll see solid positive
operating leverage, but not going to characterize the level specifically at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then, I guess, sort of a related question is on the medium-term efficiency goal
of 56%. Currently on an adjusted basis, you're 61.2% and curious on how you're thinking about that glide path
down to the 56%. What type of timing do you think is reasonable updated based upon updated trends in the
business whether you're seeing when do you think you can hit the 56%? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, yeah. [ph] We're going (00:35:03) to drive towards that. I would note that the efficiency ratio was, sort of, an
outcome, frankly, and the most important metrics are revenue growth, return on capital, and positive operating
numbers that we're driving too. But the efficiency is a key metric. And so we are watching it carefully. My
expectation at this point is, sort of, during the second half of the year, we will see those emerge. We're still doing
some of the budgeting to modulate the precision with respect to quarters but certainly, I think by the second half
of the year and the exit run rate of Q4 is my expectation.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. TCF had about a $2-plus billion inventory finance portfolio, I'm curious, where is that portfolio today? And then,
the auto dealer floor plan balances at Huntington, kind of, pre-COVID versus today. What I'm getting at is what's
the upside to the balance sheet when inventories in both of those portfolios hypothetically normalize?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I think as we've talked about a bit over time, interestingly, each of the three major kind of line businesses
that we've got auto, inventory and general middle market, each of them represented roughly $2 billion
opportunities when those utilization rates return to normalized pre-COVID levels. So that's, sort of, give you an
order of magnitude. The trends we're seeing at this point in auto, we're down a couple more percentage points, 3
to be precise between the end of Q2 and the end of Q3 to 25%.
At this point, I'm seeing relative stability in the auto floor plan business to some degree, some of the chip issues
and other supply chain issues produce some incremental pressure. We're also getting some defined and known
new commitments, and some term debt into those businesses such that my expectation is relatively flat in that
space. And interestingly, inventory finance has similar opportunities where we're creating some very known
planned uses of those lines.
So expect stability, perhaps even a modest uptick actually into Q4 that the general middle market should continue
to be flat here for the time being. However, I'm going to [indiscernible] (00:37:33) answer your question. But I was
holding back a second, I would just highlight that it's our planning expectation at this point that the totality of these
lines is going to be relatively flat throughout the course of 2022.
There could well be an opportunity against that. But at this point, for planning purposes, we're trying to zero that
out. But we still expect pretty good loan growth. And I think that's really just, sort of, pointing back to the robust
new production activity that we're seeing. So this could be ultimately, the tailwind. We do expect over time
[indiscernible] (00:38:03) be and the headwind nature has largely moderated at this point. We expect it generally
flat.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thank you. And then as a follow-up, the $114 million of service charges on the TCF part, were the fee
adjustments made right after the conversion, I remember there was some revisions that [ph] were going to made
(00:38:24) that would result in lower fees, and I'm just looking at that run rate and asking if that's sustainable
going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. It's a great question. And upon conversion that we completed over the Columbus Day weekend, all the TCF
customers are now on to the Huntington products, the platform and all of our Fair Play product dynamics. And so
we will expect to see a modestly lower trajectory for that line into Q4. Overall, over the longer term, we feel great
about the conversion to the Fair Play business as we've talked about a lot. And this is a play we have run many
times and we're very confident in the returns that are generated. Typically, the dynamic is sort of a higher degree
of fee income reduction in the early periods offset over time by incremental deepening and incremental acquisition
in the market from those products. Generally, about an 18-month payback and so that's sort of the dynamic, we're
15


Huntington Bancshares, Inc.

expecting to see a bit lower into Q4 and then clawing back and paying back over that kind of roughly 1.5 year
period.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just back on the loan growth topic you highlighted the late-stage middle market up 36%. And then, just curious
what you think is behind that and how much things have changed over the last couple of quarters? And then,
Steve or Rich, do you have any feedback on the supply chains loosening up from your borrowers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Jon, I'll start this. This is Steve. Rich or Zach may choose to add. But the supply chain issues continue to be a
challenge. You're seeing some OEMs ship and deliver without ships. Even some of the autos are doing that. But
we've got auto dealers with no new inventory on the lot is shocking to illustrate the challenges here. And as I think
you saw with the Ford, GM earnings announcements, expectations that it's going to go deep into next year before
it gets normalized.
So that's why Zach's earlier comment is we're not counting on utilization, normalization and inventory finance or
auto to be a tailwind next year. If it happens, that's great. Now we do see supply chain issues getting resolved or
getting to a resolution over time. And I would expect that to continue again through next year, maybe even a little
bit beyond, depending on the industry. But there's a lot of activity in the footprint about tooling and additional
manufacturing capabilities in – with adjacency in North America, including in the footprint states that we are in.
So, we like how this steps up over time in terms of additional opportunity for us, and we are bullish, but we clearly
had both the supply chain and the labor issue in virtually every business that's out there today.

Thank you, Steve. It's Rich, maybe just to piggyback on that. I think as it relates to middle market low demand,
we're seeing in a couple of places. I think Steve mentioned, increased CapEx, given the labor issues, I think there
is a bigger push to automate production to garner that productivity that will offset some of the labor issues.
The other thing that we're seeing is just a heightened level of M&A. I think as we're coming out of kind of the
COVID fog here with respect to EBITDA levels and things, there is just a greater sense of certainty around cash
flows. And I think buyers are aggressively looking to expand if they can and sellers, I think some of them have just
got a little tired, kind of, going through a COVID environment and when their cash flows are picking back up to a
position where maybe they want to sell. And so we are seeing increased M&A in the middle market space as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
There is also, Jon, a dynamic in the Twin Cities and Denver. TCF did not have their market banking. There were a
series of things they just didn't do. So, these are greenfield. Every customer is net new, and that the teams are in
place as earlier mentioned and I will be building them out further. But we've got the core in place. We're seeing
success and that's translating into additional cross-sell revenue as well, and that's contributing to this optimism.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q

Yeah, I'm guessing, SBA fall in that as well. Is that fair?

Jon Arfstrom Q

Okay. And then can you just touch on your repurchase appetite from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. This is Zach. I'll take that one, Jon. I think, look, we're being pretty dynamic on it. We had a very intentional
plan that's going into the third quarter as we noted in the July call to accelerate in front load and we felt great
about the $500 million. I think we're going to likely continue to be somewhat front loaded with the balance of that
here in Q4 and as we go into Q1, but still working through it and I think looking to be dynamic as we do that.

Good morning, Ken.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Zach, I was just wondering in the third quarter, did you have some gross savings in there or – and can you tell us
what they were? I know you're only kind of telling us that we're going to decline from here, but just wondering
what you might have already captured?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I would say that they were quite modest in the third quarter. I think, if you think about the cost savings, they
came largely from – ultimately branch rationalization, employee level of reductions, technology synergies
supporting the TCF business essentially onto the Huntington tech stack and that's sort of a long tail of other
savings, including a number of vendor and sourcing related opportunities that come with sort of increased scale.
And for the most part, most of those really were beginning to be executed on during the third quarter with sort of
effect more into the fourth and as you go into the first quarter.
The decisions around them and the planning and actions necessary to achieve them have essentially all been
completed, and now we're in the execution mode of just realizing them. So not much, I guess, is the long-winded
answer in the third quarter, more substantively in the fourth quarter, which is partially why we're talking about, sort
of, a larger step down in the fourth quarter than we've done before. And then if we go into the first quarter, sort of,
yet again, a similar level of step down is my current expectation. Then, a bit of a more of an [indiscernible]
(00:45:45) function as you get into Q3 and Q4, but still stepping down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
And a follow-up on that, do you have any change to your view of the original [ph] 490 (00:45:55) in total that you
expect? I know you're telling us, maybe we see a little bit more of a pull forward from a timing perspective, but
what about the absolute amount?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
No. I mean the absolute amount is solid at that level, and I mean we're kind of within rounding errors higher than
that. So, nothing overly substantive that I would call out. I point you to the [ph] 490 (00:46:13) is that's the number
we're looking to achieve and we've got...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Okay. And last cleanup one, just PPP in the deck, you showed that you're $54 million of the fees left. How do you
expect the NII related to PPP to traject from here, fourth quarter and beyond on the [ph] $40 million (00:46:28)
something?

It's kind of like a half-life function. I would tell you, over the next three quarters, we're expecting roughly 50% of
the ADV to reduce into the fourth quarter, and then roughly 50% of that reducing into the first and then yet again
into the second. These are planning assumptions I'm giving. We should note that it's pretty dynamic. And the SBA
to their credit has been accelerating forgiveness quite substantively recently. And so these numbers move around
but from a planning perspective, that's essentially the kind of outlook function that we've got.

Just I wanted to drill down on the service charge on deposits here, and a good quarter from, I think, expectations
and Steve when you look at the press, the headlines, that it gets talked about a lot that there is going to be some
restrictions on overdraft? And just curious how you are thinking about that and how that may impact your fees
going forward? And then secondly, when I think of the overdraft side of things, Fair Play banking, something that
you guys have, I think your overdraft fees would be a smaller portion of revenue to peers, but get your screen a
little bit higher there. Just curious as to why you think that may be the case as well? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
David, great questions. We put 24 hour grace in more than a decade ago and that continues to this day. We
opened it up last year for small business and we're continuing to do certain things to help our customers. Standby
cash is a classic example of that. There is no limit to the use of those funds with our customers. We put up a
minimum of $50 in last year for an overdraft and call that safety zone. So, we have been continuously over time
working to benefit our customers as part of this Fair Play banking philosophy.
We tend to be very strong on a relative basis in terms of customer acquisition as a consequence of the different
features and functions on our checking products. And that's ameliorated the revenue give up over the last decade
or so very, very substantially. As Zach pointed out, there will be a bit of a step down in the fourth quarter for a
couple of quarters thereafter with the TCF customers. But they're going to get the same advantage of products
and services that all of our previously existing customers have as well.

And it will accompany our expectation around both customer retention and customer acquisition. It's hard to – I
can't speculate on what regulators may do, but again we've been trying to do things to help consumers and
businesses for quite some time. Not just with overdraft fees, but other types of fee eliminations, reductions, notice
requirements, we put a new alert system in, in that regard 1.5 years ago. So there's a lot of tools available to help
customers manage their money, budgets, et cetera, and avoid overdraft fees.
