Dominic Ng
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Adrienne. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call.
I'm pleased to report that the strength of East West diversified business model have continued to deliver for our
shareholders in the second quarter. Second quarter 2024 net income was $288 million, or $2.06 per diluted
share. We grew end of period loans and deposits in a balanced way, growing each by 2%. Loans grew in line with
our expectation, driven by C&I and residential mortgage. Deposits grew across commercial and consumer
groups, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of customer deposit growth exceeding $1 billion.
Our balance sheet growth was complemented by record quarterly fee income of $77 million, up 8% quarter-over-
quarter as we have focus on growing our fee businesses. This growth was driven by notable continuous strength
in foreign exchange income and wealth management fees. Second quarter annualized net charge-offs remained
stable at $23 million. Our non-performing asset ratio was 27 basis point at quarter end, amount lowest when
compared to our peers. And our criticized loans decreased 10%.
We are confident that our disciplined underwriting and monitoring standards will serve us well through the cycle,
and we remain proactive in managing our credit risk. Overall, our asset quality remained strong. We delivered top
tier value for our shareholders in the second quarter, generating a 1.6% return on average assets and a 17.5%

return on tangible common equity in the second quarter. Tangible book value per share also grew by 3% quarter-
over-quarter and 15% year-over-year.
And lastly, I'm pleased to announce that East West Bank has once again been selected by Bank Director
magazine as the number one performing bank above $50 billion in assets. This is the second consecutive year
we have earned a top spot and is our third title in the past four years. This achievement is a testament to the
steady execution of our associates, and demonstrates our resilience in what proved to be a challenging year for
the banking sector.
I will now turn the call over to Chris to provide more details on our second quarter financial performance. Chris?

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Dominic.
Turning to loans on slide 4. End of period loans grew 2% quarter-over-quarter with overall growth in line with our
expectations. C&I growth was driven by notable increases in entertainment lending and overall C&I utilization
levels. However, our growth came very late in the second quarter. We expect C&I to continue to grow over the
back half of the year, but likely at a more moderate pace. Residential mortgage production was consistent, and
our pipeline levels remained strong going into Q3. We expect residential mortgage will continue to be a growth
driver at present levels. In commercial real estate, we saw healthy growth in multi-family in Q2, offset by declines
in the remainder of the CRE portfolio. We are continuing to work with our longstanding clients, but foresee very
modest CRE loan growth for us for the balance of 2024.
Moving on to deposits on slide 5, we grew end of period deposits by 2% to a new record level of $60 billion, with
growth coming across all of our customer groups. Q2 marks the fourth consecutive quarter of $1 billion-plus
customer growth, reflecting our focus on full relationships. Notably, our end of period non-interest-bearing deposit
mix remained stable at 25%.
Pushing the margin, slide 6 covers our margin and net interest income trends. Second quarter dollar net interest
income totaled $553 million, while our net interest margin was 3.27%. As expected, NIM compression for the
quarter reflected higher overall deposit and funding costs, partially offset by improving mostly fixed rate asset
yields. As we move through the second half of the year, we expect NIM to grind marginally lower before bottoming
out. Nonetheless, increasing asset growth is expected to drive growing dollar NII through the back half of the
year.
Slide 7 summarizes our non-interest income trends. We achieved a record level of fee income, $77 million this
quarter, up $6 million or 8% from the prior quarter, with growth in every fee category. I think that says a lot.
With that, let me turn the call over to Irene.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
On slide 8, credit trends remain stable and the asset quality of our portfolio remains strong. As Dominic
mentioned earlier, we reported net charge-offs in the second quarter of $23 million or 18 basis points annualized
compared to $23 million or 17 basis points annualized in the first quarter of 2024.
Quarter-over-quarter non-performing assets rose by 4 basis points to 27 basis points of total assets, primarily due
to increases from C&I loans and commercial real estate loans we have foreclosed on. Nonetheless, the absolute
level of non-accrual loans and non-performing assets remains relatively low and at manageable levels.
Criticized loans decreased during the quarter by 10%, driven by decreases in both special mention and
substandard loans. The special mention loan ratio decreased 22 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 0.83% of
loans, and the classified loans ratio has decreased 3 basis points to 1.22%. We recorded a higher provision for
credit losses of $37 million in the second quarter compared with $25 million for the first quarter.
With regards to commercial real estate loan maturities, as of June 30, 2024, 5% of outstanding balances are
scheduled to mature by the end of 2024, and 10% of outstanding balances will mature in 2025. For office loans
specifically, 8% of outstanding balances will mature in 2024 and 16% will mature in 2025. We remain vigilant and
proactive in managing our credit risk. Based on what we know today, we continue to expect quarterly net charge-
offs to be in the range of 15 basis points to 25 basis points for the foreseeable future.
Turning to slide 9. The total allowance for loan losses increased $14 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by the
expected economic outlook and also loan growth during the quarter, resulting in allowance for loan losses
coverage ratio of 1.30%. Within commercial real estate, we increased the reserve for office loans by $7 million,
bringing the total coverage ratio to 3.10% of office loans. We believe our loan portfolio is appropriately reserved
as of June 30, 2024.
Turning to slide 10. All of East West regulatory capital ratios remain well in excess of regulatory requirements for
well-capitalized institutions and well above regional bank averages. East West Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio
stands at a robust 13.7%, while our tangible common equity ratio is at 9.4%. These capital ratios place us among
the most well-capitalized banks in the industry. East West repurchased 560,000 shares of common stock during
the second quarter, or approximately $41 million at an average price under $73 a share. We currently have $49
million of repurchase authorization that remains available for future buybacks. East West third quarter 2024
dividend will be payable on August 16, 2024 to stockholders of record on August 2.
I will now turn it back to Chris to share our outlook for the 2024 full year. Chris?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Irene.
Our full year outlook remains largely unchanged from the first quarter. We are still assuming the forward curve as
of this quarter end, and currently expect that first rate cut in September. We continue to expect full year end of
period loan growth in the range of 3% to 5%. We expect full year net interest income to decline in the range of 2%
to 4%. We also continue to expect adjusted non-interest expense to increase in the range of 6% to 8%.
Regarding tax items, we now expect for the effective tax rate to be lower in the range of 21% to 23% versus the
prior range of 23% to 24%. We also now expect full year tax credit amortization expense to be within the range of
$60 million to $65 million.

With that, I will now open the call to questions. Operator?
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first
question comes from Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey, good afternoon, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good afternoon, Dave.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
I want to start on fee income. You guys had highlighted this earlier. You had a solid quarter there with some pretty
broad-based growth. So, I was hoping you could talk about what you're expecting for that trajectory in the back
half or what you're thinking for the full year in terms of growth overall.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. So we've had about 10% full year year-over-year growth through the midpoint. When I think about the core
drivers of that, obviously deposit account fees are the biggest component, and that's also been growing at that
same pace. And it's been growing, call it, in the range of $1 million a quarter. I don't know if that will continue in a
declining rate environment immediately, but it should bode well going for another quarter or so.
Lending fees are a function of lending growth. I think we've commented that we expect lending to moderate over
the back half of the year, so I would expect that's the case. And derivatives goes along with lending to a certain
extent. FX has been a wonderful piece of our business that's contributed greatly this quarter. It does have some
volatility. And the wealth management fees, which have grown very nicely, have obviously been benefiting from
the backdrop of positive overall equity markets and a strong fixed income yield opportunity. Again, that will
probably moderate to some extent as we look over the back half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. So, all in, maybe a little bit of moderation, but still looking for some decent growth there, it sounds like?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
It's a core focus of us to drive overall fee income levels higher over time.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Okay. Maybe – appreciate that. Maybe it's my follow-up on capital last quarter, I know you were talking about a
target TCE ratio range around where it is right now, 93%, 94%. Any changes to the thinking on that? And should
we expect that range for at least the back half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think we continue to believe it's not in our or shareholders' interest for us to warehouse additional capital beyond
these levels. Obviously, it'll bounce around a few basis points, but we're trying to be thoughtful about managing
that in the best interest of returns.

Operator: The next question comes from Jared Shaw with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good afternoon, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Maybe just looking or starting with margin and taking into account the strong growth that you just pointed out in
C&I at the end of the quarter, as well as maybe some of the dynamics around potentially getting to the end of a
deposit remix pressure. How should we be thinking about margin over the next few quarters with that backdrop?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, we still expect margin to have some downward compression over the back half of the year. Not sure if the
trough will come in Q3 or Q4, but we think it does trough later this year. That having been said, while we think
margin will come down a bit, we do see dollar NII growing precisely because the balances grew here in the
second quarter, and we still see incremental growth, although at a more moderate pace in the third and fourth
quarters. So balance sheet growth will keep the NII moving higher, NIM will still see compression, and we expect
that to trough as we get later in the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And is that margin compression, I guess, coming more from just some tail on funding costs, or are you not
getting maybe the same spreads on the incremental C&I loan as you have in maybe the existing portfolio?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think we expect some downward compression on fixed rate assets as the expectation for Fed cut comes into
play. And so, the higher yields, for example, that we've been earning here more recently on mortgages will start to
come down, and some other fixed rate options as well as fixed rate investments. Those will put incremental
downward pressure on the fixed rate asset repricing. At the same time, we don't think the Fed cut, which probably
won't come until mid-September, will do much to dampen the near-term deposit costing that we have to roll over
here in the third quarter. So, you'll recall, we had a fairly significant first quarter Lunar New Year CD campaign
where we're out there today growing deposits and managing that. But it's not at 25 basis points or 30 basis points
lower level because rates haven't really moved that far down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. All right. Great. Thanks. And then maybe as my follow-up, just on credit. Any color around sort of the
dynamic with C&I NPLs up, but criticized down? Any broader trends there, or are those more one-off?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I would say, I mean, obviously, those levels, they're off very low basis. So there are loans that we're looking
at and borrowers that we're looking at carefully for C&I and then also CRE as well. But there is nothing, I would
say, that's systemic at this point, industry concentrations, regions or anything where we're overly concerned
about.

Casey Haire Q

So, I guess, another follow-up on the NIM. So, if we do get this trough in the back half of the year, like, what is the
expectation if the forward curve plays out as is? Is it NIM stability with CD repricing benefits and maturing hedges
offsetting the the pressure you feel on the floating rate loan book? Just a little color on what happens post second
half here.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, order of magnitude, I think we've said that for every 25 basis point rate cut, we would assume there'd
be something in the neighborhood of $2 million to maybe $3 million of downward pressure from the rate cuts. But
we've also said we expect about a 50% deposit beta baked into those numbers. So I think those are two things
that are in play in our forward look. With both of those assumptions baked in, given the growth that we see ahead
of us, we think the answer is rising dollar NII fairly consistently third quarter into the fourth; and margin coming
down again modestly from current levels down into a slightly lower 3.20% range and then finding its footing, and
we assume moving higher, particularly as a number of negative cash flow hedges that currently weigh on us
come off in the first quarter of 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. Okay. And then just the loan growth outlook. It sounds like you, guys – I mean, obviously, the CRE, you
guys are holding the line on that near term and enjoying the C&I and resi growth. But it sounds as if you are
looking to open that up or get reengage in commercial real estate in 2025, unless I'm misreading that. But just
wondering, where – CRE concentration, what's the strategy there like? When can you turn that back on? Is there
a certain level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, to be clear, we're always here for our core customers, and we're always engaged to support them. We just
haven't been pursuing marginal new transactions. And so, we will continue to engage with our core customers
and service our portfolios and help them with whatever comes their way.
With regard to the overarching loan strategy, I think Dominic has articulated a long-term plan to get to a third, a
third, a third, and that will involve us growing our C&I and residential portfolios over time at a faster clip than CRE.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I just want to add one additional comment here, is that it's not like that we are looking for marginal business in the
past and now we're not. It's really coming back to the issue, is that our core customers [indiscernible] (20:57) see
a lot of very interesting activity for them to engage in. So, our volume on CRE have dropped a lot; has – no, that is
simply because of the fact that there are just not a lot of great deals out there. So, we expect CRE activities will
probably continue to slow, simply because of the external environment factor. And so, our position is that we
always have the capital and the balance sheet to support our core customers in any kind of economic
environment. But for them to be our core customers that worthy of support, they obviously are the people that are
very savvy and know what they're doing, and so they wouldn't be foolishly getting involved in transaction that don't
make sense. So, that's why the volume of C&I to CRE, et cetera, very much tie into, to a certain extent, interest
rate environment and also the economic circumstances.
And so, that's how we see utilization in C&I, also relatively low for the last couple of years, simply because
[indiscernible] (22:13) this kind of interest rate is high for people to draw down because the cost of borrowing is so
much higher. So, all-in-all, I think that that's the beauty of having strong capital and strong balance sheet, and be
in the position to always take good care of our customers. These good customers, in turn, will continue to take
care of us.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Well, good afternoon.

Good afternoon.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Maybe for us, first one, just, Chris, on like slide 22. So, you saw some mix shift from cash into securities during
the quarter. Is that kind of steady state just remind us, one, when we think about securities to earning assets, are
we where we want to be? And then, in terms of the level of cash you want to be holding, is the $4 billion related to
the $16 billion the right sort of level to think about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And I think we said last quarter, we thought the overall cash and securities, and we kind of look at that as
one basket, would stay relatively stable relative to total balance sheet. And I think that's, certainly, happened on
an average basis. The amount that can be invested, I think from a variety of factors, probably doesn't come down
a lot after the $4 billion in cash component, but could come down a little bit more. We, certainly, have the
bandwidth and flexibility to do that, but we're not pushing that where, again, our focus is on core customer activity,
core loan growth, core deposit growth. And I think that will shape most of the change in the balance sheet over
the back half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess, just the other one, maybe, Dominic, for you, just sentiment among your commercial
customers as you think about maybe getting a September rate card, you're going to get to the elections, do you
see those being a trigger where we could see an acceleration in loan growth and loan demand? Like, do you feel
there is some pent-up demand that could lead to a rebound in sort of loan growth looking into 2025? And is the
beginning of the rate cut cycle and elections enough to do that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, based on the current expectation on the rate cuts, I wouldn't think that the rate cut would be sort of like
significant enough that can really move that much of a needle. The fact is, a 25 basis point cut here and there, I
mean, even if we do it two to three times, it's less than 1%. And when we're sitting at 5.5% [indiscernible] (24:56)
rate, I don't think that's material enough to really drive a lot of excitement in terms of making investment and
whatnot. And then, also – election is something no one knows right now. I mean, there's a lot of drama going on.
So, we'll just all have to watch it and see how it goes, and then to see how would that affect business sentiment.
But at this stage right now, my expectation is still going to be that everything stays more or less the same here.
It's like maybe it's exactly what the Fed is driving in soft lending. I think that's what it looks like, it's going in that
direction. So far, business seems to be holding up pretty good, but no one's going out there trying to aggressively

chase new business at this point. And I expect that's going to be the way it is for the fourth quarter and possibly
even the first quarter. And then we'll see, we'll see how election may affect policy and so forth.

So, from what I understand, residential is going to lead loan growth in the back half of the year, so could you just
talk about what you're seeing in that category as far as demand? I know there's concerns about housing supply. I
know you have a unique product. But just give us some context behind your outlook [indiscernible] (26:35) driving
growth for the back half of the year and how sensitive that could be to interest rate moves and other things.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And let me just make sure we're clear. Residential growth will continue to be a consistent contributor to the
growth at about the pace it's been here over the first half of the year into the second half of the year. Our pipelines
already here in the third quarter would support that. We don't see that necessarily shifting much in our outlook.
C&I will be, as was this quarter, is a prominent contributor to the quarter. It will moderate, but it could also still be
a good contributor to the overall growth.
We do have a unique product offering, and one way to think about it is most of our borrowers are only borrowing
$0.50 on the dollar. And so, by definition, they're sort of 5/8 as rate sensitive as your typical 80% LTV borrower.
And therefore, we have not seen the same downdraft in overall origination activities, and we think that will hold
here. As Dominic mentioned, we don't think a rate cut or two will make too much difference to the outlook. And
those people that are coming to us pursuing the American dream of homeownership are not going to be turned
away or more excited necessarily by, give or take, 25 basis points.

Got it. Got it. Okay. And then, in regards to the NIM commentary, I think you briefly mentioned kind of CD
repricing, particularly the Lunar New Year deposits. Could you just give us some context behind what you're
expecting as far as CD repricing in the back half of the year and how dependent that is on rate cuts or not?

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, the bulk of the Lunar CD pricing or the CD pricing driver in the first quarter was at a rate of [ph] 5.25
(28:28). Our current special offerings today are at [ph] 5 and 4.88 (28:34), and we therefore expect that we will be
able to reprice somewhat lower. But that's also a function of all of that coming through, and most of that activity is
sort of February into March. So, the proof will be in August and into September when those come off. And we
think, right now, we have a competitive rate that will keep us managing and maintaining those balances. But we'll
see how that plays out over the next 45 days.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Sticking with the line of questioning on deposits, nice reversal and trends within DDA. Is that sustainable going
forward? Do you think that we've kind of troughed within excess liquidity exiting the balance sheet, or is there still
some risk maybe in the back end of the year that there is some more migration in that line?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We definitely see it as rate-dependent. And so, what we've said previously, and we still believe to be the case is,
as long as rates remain elevated, there will be incremental push for deposit migration, that did somewhat slow
here in the second quarter, and there was a little pop at the end of the quarter, but the trend would be still
somewhat negative migration until the rate cuts start. And at that point, as expectations dip lower, we think the
incremental bid away from money market funds and from other offerings will be less enticing, and result in less
migration and even possibly stabilization and then subsequent reversal. And we think that's our modeling view.
But we also see anecdotally that other banks have reported similar stabilization, and we think that's consistent
with industry trend.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. And then, maybe following up on Ebrahim's question, just looking at some of the uncertainties with the
election, I'm just wondering if your Greater China clientele are maybe pulling forward some of the activity and
anticipation of some of the uncertainty, maybe, in the back end of the year. I guess, what is the temperature
gauge of your Greater China client base and how are they thinking about the election risk or lack thereof in the
back end of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, if you look at our Greater China customers, I think that – I don't think they have a much big anticipation of
what's going to come out from the election one way or the other. And I mean, as we looked at interesting enough
for the last eight years under two different administrations, and if you look at the tariff started in 2017, but then in
the current administration, not only just keep going on, in fact, add a little bit more, but then if you take a look at
East West Bank, we haven't really stopped growing our cross-border business, and we consistently outperform
our peer groups in terms of financial performance. I think it all get down to, at the end of the day, despite political
rhetorics and there are some US, China geopolitical issue when it get down to national security, et cetera, the
common goods that have been shipped between US and China, import and export, really hasn't slowed down that
much.
There are a lot of business still, a commerce, going back and forth. And I would say that the vast majority of the
business are really business going as usual. They don't like to hear those rhetorics. However, the business is still
going as usual. What we found is that many of our customers, whether they are an import business, export
business from the Greater China region or US to the Asia region, and they continue to do business, they continue
to find ways to do business.
And we, at East West, continue to navigate in this rough sea and somehow understanding the dynamic, and I
think we've done a pretty good job in managing this overall US geopolitical situation. And that's why we uniquely
find a way to continue to be one of the highest performing bank in a country, simply because we know what we're
doing and we continue to go through [ph] eight years. For many others, we'll look at (33:43) significant turmoil. But
for us, somehow we get by just fine. And this is something that we feel very confident in the next four to eight
years. I don't know who's going to be the president. It really doesn't matter to us because we're here to run East
West Bank. We know how to run our business, and so far so good.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Hey, thank you. First one for me is just around capital. Given that you're not looking to accrete more capital at this
stage, should we just assume you re-up the buyback when you're done? Or are you more price sensitive at this
level. And then, if not, any other ways to return capital that you might be considering?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I'll begin with we've always been both opportunistic and shareholder friendly, and those guiding principles will
remain during the quarter. I think we were fairly opportunistic in the repurchases we did. We didn't fully utilize
what we have left. We have $49 million yet to go, and we'll continue to look at it on an opportunistic basis. We
would not expect to reauthorize until we've exhausted our current program. And so, we'll update you as that
comes together.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. But you're not considering any other types of capital return at this stage other than organic growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We traditionally look at our dividend on an annual basis, and we'll obviously look at that as we look to our
expectations for 2025. I think, obviously, our, first and foremost, use of capital is to support our customers. That
will always be our first use capital. We are not currently contemplating any meaningful M&A activity, and we
certainly think about the other uses of capital in a shareholder friendly manner.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. And then, for the question just on the loan side, I think you hired the head of entertainment lending

Matthew T. Clark Q

...to that in the first quarter, okay? Have they contributed to that entertainment growth yet? And how large of a
contributor would you like that vertical to be, or what's your limit in that vertical?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, they have already contributed; and yes, one of the key drivers of growth in our C&I business for this quarter
was an uptick in entertainment lending. And I think we like all of our verticals, but we particularly like the
entertainment vertical being based here in the Los Angeles region.
Dominic, anything you'd care to add?

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Anything you'd care to add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Oh, well, I think that as much as we always like to have this industry vertical to continue to excel, but we at East
West Bank has very much put overall risk oversight as a priority. That's why if you reflect back in March 2023, we
didn't have the kind of problems like some of the other larger banks had in California, because we did not
overload ourselves with private equity or venture capital, not that we didn't like the business, we love those
business, we're doing good with those business, but we'll never allow us to overextend to one particular industry
that potentially when there is a run or here and there that causes harm. So I very much expect the entertainment
business to continue to grow not only in the United States, but also in the Greater China region. We expect the
entertainment business to go in a very healthy pace, with the exception that we'll never allow it to grow so much.
That becomes overconcentrated, that potentially causes regret someday when there is so much concentration in
one particular industry.
So, East West always run a diversified portfolio, as you can see. Actually, quarter-by-quarter, we always have
different winners. When Chris talked about this quarter, is entertainment and something else, next quarter
probably be somebody else again. It's nice to see those different units all competing positively to get that
championship for a quarter. And then, by doing that, we don't have an issue of overconcentration.

There could be. And obviously, last year, Chris, you'll recall the company made a significant investment in
[indiscernible] (39:07), the asset management entity that we took the 49% stake in. And so, those types of
opportunities may present themselves, but it's not top of the agenda as we sit here today looking forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And, Chris, while I have you, I just want to get a little bit of a better understanding on slide 6 where you talk
about the $1 billion of cash flow hedges that come off in the first quarter [indiscernible] (39:36) and then the
hedges in the back half. How should we think about just the impact on margin and NII from those actions in next
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So, the current cash flow hedges are costing us, this looks at top of that page, the impact is about $25 million a
quarter, and it's pulling down the NIM by about 15 basis points in the current period. And those hedges largely
expire come Q1 2025. And so, essentially, that negative drag will work its way down. Of course, if there's a rate
cut in September and additional ones in Q4, it'll incrementally chip away at that. But that whole amount will come
off Q1 2025. And what will happen then is somewhere in the second half of the year, $1 billion of new hedges will
come on, with a blended average receive of $4 billion to the extent by the middle of 2025, the Fed's down to $4
billion, no harm, no foul. If it's above there, it'll cost us a little for the interim. If it's below there, we'll see the benefit
of that in our bottom line, be it in the second half of 2025.

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask on the loan side, on the C&I side in particular, Christopher, your
mention of the surge late quarter. I don't think I heard you comment on this, but wonder if there's any throughline
in terms of types of loans, business purpose or commentary from borrowers that you think kind of drove that
surge?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
There was a little bit more activity late in the day from some private equity and one particular biotech-related
entity. And I think we were a little bit surprised by the volatility, but it was positive, so we took it. And I think we've
seen some of that activity move back already, which we're not exactly where we expected, but a bit of volatility.
But nonetheless, we expect to grow balances in total throughout the third quarter and the fourth quarter.

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay, great. And then, if you could update us on the thoughts around the FHLB borrowings you have that
replaced the BTFP, is that purely going to be a function of liquidity trends over time in terms of paying that down,
or is there a more specific focus on on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, I think we're focused on making sure we get past sort of this rollover period here with the CDs in Q3. And if
we continue to see positive trends, which we have seen and continue to see so far into the Q3 period, additional
oncoming – onboarded customers on the deposit side, we'll consider where we put those incremental dollars to
work, whether that's to just earn cash at the Fed or pay down liabilities, that's about a push. So, we'll look at that
and put the money to work, obviously, every day.

liquidity profile.

Samuel Varga Q

Good afternoon. I just want to go back to the deposit conversation for a little bit. Could you provide an update on
private banking deposits and specifically, I guess, how they've trended over the past 12 months? And then, what
sort of growth you anticipate over the next 12 to 18 months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, our private banking customers participated in our CD specials, and found that a positive place to put
incremental balances to work. And so, those balances have generally grown. We expect them to likely continue to
grow as wealth management solutions overall have grown nicely. And as they come in, they allocate a portion of
their portfolio or they reallocate record equity levels into fixed income and stable products. And that has generally
been a win for us.

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A

I think, on the wealth management area, we see a tremendous potential for East West Bank. Our approach is not
to trying to do a quick hit, but rather take our time to strategically plan it in the right way, and then have gradual,
sustainable, recurring and profitable type of business. So far, has been going good. I mean, oftentime people may
look at our overall wealth management fee income. It's really not at a very high level from a percentage standpoint
to our overall profitability, but we're trying to grow it in the right way. And we see a tremendous opportunity and
potential for the demographic of the customers that we have so far. And we just see that there is just going to be
great opportunity, not only just here in the United States and even potentially in Asia area.

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A

SOFR+, I'll call it, [ph] $115 million (46:44) for conversation. And the cash flow on a recurring monthly basis is

Manan Gosalia Q

I wanted to ask on the spreads that you're getting on your new loans. Some of your peers have highlighted that
there is tougher competition from both banks and non-banks, and that's putting pressure on C&I spreads. Is that
something you're seeing in your portfolio as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A

Yeah, I think we're seeing in C&I generally in the SOFR+ $250 million zone for most of the stuff that we're putting
on balance sheet, I don't know that that's atypical for the traditional business [ph] lines (48:09) that we've done,

Got it. And then on the commercial real estate front, can you talk about what your conversations have been like
with borrowers? Do you think two or three rate cuts from here will alleviate some of the pressure that they are
feeling, especially on the office and multifamily side? And more recently, as you've maybe extended or whichever
loans have come up for extension, what has been the reaction from the borrowers that that brought in more
equity? Just looking to get some more color there. Thanks.

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So, as Dominic said a few minutes ago, I don't know that a rate cut or two will make that much difference in the
near term. And so, if rates are elevated in the 5-plus zip code for an extended period of time on the base rate, it's
likely there will be pain to be felt by a number of borrowers, many of whom buy into projects at cap rates of 5% a
few years ago. So that'll be a challenge for many of them.
We have taken a very hard look with Irene and Dominic, but also obviously our credit teams and our ATMs, et
cetera, all the way down to figure out what's coming due, what's the situation, where are the cash flows, where is
the debt service coverage, what else can we do with these customers that are up for renewal from now through
the end of 2025, has been the primary focus. But looking at things even beyond that, just to make sure that we're
on top of things. So I think the short answer is, we're doing all of the above to make sure that we're proactive and
ahead of it. It is an issue; but to the extent that rates come down, not one or two cuts, but 100 basis points, 150
basis points, things get easier. And obviously, if rates come down 200 basis points, well, probably there's a lot of
issues that just go away.

I'll just add to [indiscernible] (50:00) the macro environment for office, it is what it is, but this continuous review of
the portfolio, this is something we started before the pandemic; and afterwards that we did there for our borrowers
to kind of shore up, pay down loans, pledge additional asset, what have you. And today, I think if you look at the
results that we have, the still very, very good credit quality across the board, a lot of that is the proactive actions
we took years ago.

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
[indiscernible] (50:50). Yeah. Sort of. The vast majority of our customers are floating rate borrowers; and while
they might fix their need to refinance if they can, will be best met on the short end.
