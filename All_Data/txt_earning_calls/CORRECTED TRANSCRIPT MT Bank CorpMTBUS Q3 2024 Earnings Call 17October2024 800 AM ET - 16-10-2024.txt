Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As you will hear on today's call, the third quarter results represent
M&T's continued strength through a dynamic economic environment. We continue to support our communities
that we serve. For the 16th consecutive year, M&T Bank is among the nation's top 10 SBA lenders, ranking
number one in Baltimore, Buffalo, Connecticut, Delaware, Syracuse, and Washington, D.C.
We recently launched the third phase of our [audio gap] (00:03:31), which will provide $25 million to non-profits
focused on financial inclusion and economic growth across New England, Long Island, and New York's
Westchester County. We also recently updated several environmental goals, including offsetting 100% of our
electricity use with renewable energy by 2030 and establishing interim reduction targets for Scope 1 and 2
emissions.
Turning to slide 5. Our employees and products continue to receive awards from consumer, business and trade
organizations.
Turn to slide 7, which shows the results of the third quarter. As noted in this morning's press release, we released
our third quarter results as we continue to make progress on the plans we laid out in January. There are several
successes to highlight. Net interest margin and net interest income grew sequentially as we continue to grow
loans while reducing our CRE concentration. In fact, since the fourth quarter of 2023, we have grown average
loans by nearly $2 billion while reducing CRE by over $4 billion and growing C&I and consumer loans.
Funding cost was well managed in this quarter with a 4-basis-point decline in the cost of interest-bearing
liabilities. We restarted our share repurchase program in the third quarter and executed $200 million in share
repurchases and grew our CET1 ratio to over 11.5%. Noninterest income reached a high point in the third quarter,
if you exclude the prior gains on our two divestitures. This was achieved by even considering the foregone fee
income from those two sold businesses, demonstrating the resiliency and strength of our diversified business
model. Asset quality continued to improve this quarter, with reduction in both nonaccrual balances and
commercial criticized loans and net charge-offs below the full-year outlook.
Now, let's look at the specifics for the third quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per share were $4.02 for the third
quarter, improved from $3.73 in the second quarter. Net income for the quarter was $721 million compared to
$655 million in the linked quarter, an increase of 10%. M&T's third quarter results produced an ROA and ROCE of
1.37% and 10.26%, respectively. The CET1 ratio remained strong, growing at 11.54% at the end of the third
quarter and tangible book value per share grew 5%. Of note, the third quarter included a discrete tax benefit of
$14 million or an $0.08 EPS benefit.
Slide 8 includes supplemental reporting of M&T's results on a net operating and tangible basis. M&T's net
operating income for the third quarter was $731 million compared with $665 million in the linked quarter. Diluted
net operating earnings per share were $4.08 for the recent quarter, up from $3.79 in the second quarter. Net
operating income yielded an ROTA and ROTCE of 1.45% and 15.47% for the recent quarter.

Next, let's look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated our third quarter results. Please turn to
slide 9. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1.74 billion, an increase of $8 million or 1% from the linked
quarter. The net interest margin was 3.62%, an increase of 3 basis points from the second quarter. The primary
drivers of the increase to the margin were a positive 3 basis points from fixed asset repricing mostly in the
investment portfolio and consumer loans, positive 3 basis points from earning asset mix, positive 2 basis points
from deposit and wholesale funding mix and costs, partially offset by a negative 4 basis points from lower
nonaccrual interest, and a negative 1 basis point for all other items. Nonaccrual interest amounted to $12 million
compared to $30 million in the second quarter.
Turn to slide 11 to talk about average loans. Average loans and leases increased slightly to $134.8 billion. Similar
to the trend that we saw last several quarters, C&I growth outpaced decline in CRE. C&I loans grew 3% to $59.8
billion, driven by increases in fund banking, dealer commercial services, mortgage warehouse, and franchise
lending. Middle-market utilization declined modestly, while dealer floor plan utilization increased from the second
quarter as a result of slower auto sales and new model arrivals.
CRE loans declined 8% to $29.1 billion, reflecting continued low originations and paydowns, as we continue to
manage our CRE concentration. CRE as a percent of Tier 1 capital and allowance is estimated to be 148% at the
end of the third quarter. Residential mortgage loans were relatively unchanged at $23 billion. Consumer loans
grew 4% to $22.9 billion, reflecting growth in recreational finance and indirect auto loans. Loan yields were
unchanged at 6.38%, as lower nonaccrual interest was largely offset by the benefit of fixed rate loan repricing and
mix shift.
Turning to slide 12. Our liquidity remains strong. At the end of the third quarter, investment securities and cash,
including cash held at the Fed, totaled $59 billion, representing 28% of total assets. The average investment
securities increased $1.3 billion. The yield on securities increased 9 basis points to 3.7%, as the yield on new
purchases exceeded the yield on maturing securities. In the fourth quarter, we have $1 billion in securities
maturing at an average yield of 1.8%, which we intend to reinvest. The duration of the investment portfolio at the
end of the quarter was 3.6 years, and the unrealized pre-tax gain on the available-for-sale portfolio was $68
million or 3 basis points CET1 benefit, if included in regulatory capital.
Turning to slide 13. We remain focused on growing customer deposits and are pleased with the overall deposit
performance. Average total loans declined $2 billion or 1% to $161.5 billion, reflecting a $1.1 billion decline in
broker deposits and a $0.9 billion decline in non-broker deposits. Commercial and business banking grew total
average deposits from the second quarter, while consumer deposits declined sequentially as we continue to
manage more rate-sensitive deposits. Average noninterest-bearing deposits declined $1.6 billion to $46.2 billion
from an expected deal-related decline in trust demand deposits and modest continued disintermediation within
commercial and consumer. Excluding broker deposits, average noninterest-bearing deposit mix in the third
quarter was 30.7%. Interest-bearing deposit costs decreased 2 basis points to 2.88%.
Continuing on slide 14, noninterest income was $606 million compared to $584 million in the linked quarter. Trust
income was $170 million, unchanged from the prior quarter, with second quarter seasonal tax prep fees of $4
million, offset by strong equity market performance and sales performance at ICS. Mortgage fees were $109
million compared to $106 million in the second quarter. Commercial mortgage fees increased $4 million from the
linked quarter to $34 million, reflecting an uptick in the origination activity. Service charges increased $5 million to
$132 million from both consumer and commercial, mostly related to the number of processing days in the quarter.
Other revenues from operations were unchanged at $152 million.

Turning to slide 15, noninterest expenses were $1.3 billion, an increase of $6 million from the second quarter.
Salary and benefits increased $11 million to $775 million, reflecting one additional working day. Deposit insurance
decreased $12 million, reflecting the prior quarter $5 million incremental special assessment. Other costs from
operations increased $12 million to $128 million, driven mostly by M&T's obligation under various agreements to
share in losses stemming from certain litigation of Visa. Efficiency ratio of 55% was largely unchanged from the
second quarter.
Let's turn to slide 16 for credit. Net charge-offs for the quarter were $120 million or 35 basis points, down from 41
basis points in the linked quarter. The three largest charge-offs in the quarter totaled $37 million, combined with
and represented two C&I loans and one office CRE loan. Nonaccrual loans decreased $98 million or 5% to $1.9
billion. The nonaccrual ratio decreased 8 basis points to 1.42%, driven largely by a decrease in CRE nonaccruals
from upgrades out of nonaccrual, as well as several large payoffs and paydowns. In the third quarter, we recorded
a provision of $120 million compared to a net charge-off of $120 million. The allowance-to-loan ratio decreased 1
basis point to 1.62%, as a result of continued improvements in asset quality and improvements in the
macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by growth in certain portfolios.
Please turn to slide 17. When we file our Form 10-Q in a few weeks, we estimate that the level of criticized loans
will be at $10.9 billion compared to $12.1 billion at the end of June. The improvement from the linked quarter was
driven by a $315 million decline in C&I and $830 million decline in CRE criticized balances.
Slide 18 provides additional detail on the C&I criticized balances. The largest C&I criticized balance decreases
were within the motor vehicle and recreational finance dealers and manufacturing segments, with smaller
changes across most other industries. The decline within the motor vehicle and recreational finance dealers
mostly reflects improvements in debt service coverage ratios and normalizing profit margins within the RV
segment.
Slide 19 includes the detail on CRE criticized balances. The largest CRE criticized declines were within
healthcare and construction with continued, but more modest declines in most other property types, except for
office. Within healthcare, we saw an uptick in repayment activity as improvements in occupancy and rent growth,
combined with declining long-term rates, allowed for more viable takeouts. A decline in construction criticized was
aided by improved project performance and loan modifications and curtailments, as borrowers continue to support
these projects. The largest factor that drove [audio gap] (00:16:12) versus prior quarters was the amount of
upgrades that occurred in the quarter.
Turning to slide 20 for capital. M&T's CET1 ratio at the end of the third quarter was an estimated 11.54%
compared to 11.45% at the end of the second quarter. The increase was due to continued strong earnings and
strong – and a $200 million share repurchase in the third quarter. At the end of the third quarter, the negative
AOCI impact on the CET1 ratio from available-for-sale securities and pension-related components combined
would be approximately 4 basis points.
Now, turning to slide 21 for the outlook. Let's begin with the economic backdrop. The economy remains resilient in
the third quarter, with GDP growth expected to come in stronger than we had projected. The labor market has
slowed, but remains healthy. Though we see a soft landing scenario as having the highest probability, the
possibility remains for a mild recession brought on by lagged impact and rate hikes. The consumer spending has
slowed, alleviating inflation pressure for many goods and services. Recently, inflation has nearly returned to the
Fed's target of 2%.

Now, turning to the outlook. Our outlook for the full-year NII is unchanged from our last update, while the outlook
from the full-year fees, expenses, and net charge-offs is unchanged from the ranges we initially discussed in
January and maintained through the year. That said, with three quarters complete, we will focus on the outlook for
the fourth quarter. We expect taxable-equivalent NII to be at least $1.73 billion, implying a full-year NII near the
top end of the range we provided previously. Net interest margin is expected to be in the low 3.60s. Our outlook
incorporates the latest forward curve that has an additional 50 basis points in rate cuts by the end of the year.
We expect continued loan growth and average total loans of approximately $136 billion, with growth in C&I and
consumer and lower CRE balances. Total deposits are expected to be at least $160 billion, as we continue to
focus on growing core customer deposits. We expect interest-bearing deposit beta of approximately 40% for the
first couple of interest rate cuts. Security balances are expected to continue to grow in the fourth quarter. Our
outlook for the fourth quarter noninterest income is about $600 million, reflecting continued strength in mortgage
and trust, partially offset by other fee categories.
Fourth quarter expenses, including intangible amortization, are expected to be about $1.32 billion due to the
timing of projects coming online. This reflects continued investment in our key priorities and initiatives are closely
managing our expenses. We continue to expect net charge-offs for the full year to be near 40 basis points. Our
outlook for the tax rate for the fourth quarter is about 24.25% (sic) [24% to 24.5%] (00:19:38), and the preferred
dividends are expected to be approximately $36 million. We plan to continue the $200 million share repurchase in
the fourth quarter.
To conclude on slide 22, our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis. M&T has always been a purpose-
driven organization with successful business model that benefits all stakeholders, including shareholders. We
have a long track record of credit outperforming through all economic cycles, while growing within the markets we
serve. We remain focused on shareholder returns and consistent dividend growth. Finally, we are a disciplined
acquirer and prudent steward of shareholder capital.
Now, let's open the call to questions, before which our operator will briefly review instructions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will
come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi, Daryl. How are you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Good. How are you doing, Gerard?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good. Thank you. Daryl, over the years, M&T has done a great job in managing their capital and returning excess
capital to shareholders. You're pointing out today that your CET1 ratio is a very strong 11.5%, and you have the
buyback going on again in the fourth quarter. Can you share with us whether you think the CET1 ratio is at an
optimal level. And to get there, could you increase the share repurchases as you go forward into 2025 and once
we also get the final Basel III Endgame so you guys know what to expect?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Gerard. First, I just want to start with that we have a lot of flexibility when it comes to capital with a
CET1 ratio of 11.5%, and we had really no negative impact on the AOCI. And we have strong capital generation.
That said, as we continue to move forward into the end of the fourth quarter and into 2025, we will continue to
look at the economy. Economy continues to grow now, but [ph] if we're starting (00:22:09) to slow down, that
could impact potential increases to share repurchase. We've made great progress on our criticized loans. They've
come down now two consecutive quarters. We expect fourth quarter to be also a really strong decrease in
criticized. And we believe we're at the point now that our CRE exposure is where we want it to be, and we are
now – the pipeline is starting to build from that perspective.
So, I believe, in 2025, we'll return more capital to shareholders as long as it plays out, as mentioned, what I just
talked about. We will probably switch the dollar amounts and target more of a CET1 ratio. So, for example, we
might say we'll buy back in 2025 if we want to stay above 11% CET1 ratio and do repurchases and that depends
on how much loan growth and RWA growth that we have on the balance sheet. I know 11% is higher than what
you would need long term, but we're working on our long-term targets. And probably, we'll have something to say
about that in the next quarter or so.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good, very helpful. And then, as a follow-up, and I'm not asking for 2025 guidance because I know that won't
come until possibly January. But it looks like your net interest income has troughed. It looks like the first quarter,
based upon slide 9, that net interest income bottomed and you're gradually growing out net interest income and
the margins obviously expanding. If the forward curve is correct and if the Fed, and I know these are big ifs, but if
7


M&T Bank Corp.
(MTB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
the forward curve is correct and the Fed is correct, then that is going to lower the Fed funds rate possibly to 3% to
3.5% by the end of next year, and we'd get a positive slope in the curve. Can you kind of frame out, should this
growth that you're seeing continue and possibly accelerate in 2025 just based – aside from growing your balance
sheet, but just based on interest rates?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. You start off with a very rosy scenario. Let me just say that our team has worked really hard this past year,
in 2024, and we are really neutral on net interest income and really happy that happened just as the Fed started
lowering rate. So, we were very fortunate for that. If you look at what's going on, we have really good roll-on and
roll-off rates in a lot of our fixed asset portfolios. I know it's hard for you as analysts to really understand and get
those numbers into your models. But if you look at auto and RV, resi mortgage, and our investment portfolio, all
those continue to reprice positively this quarter. We expect that to continue next quarter and into 2025. So, that's
a positive for us. Upward sloping curve would enhance that potentially.
Yeah. On the deposit side, I just see it's the strength of our company, Gerard. It is our strong foundation that we
have. We have really strong, stable core operating deposits. We're seeing now an initial downward beta of 40%,
that's at the higher end of the range that we talked about previously. So, that's strong.
And when you look at hedging, we know we already have locked in hedges improvements in our swap book that
we're going to basically reprice our hedges. If you look at the cash flow hedges, point-to-point, they should go up
about 55 basis points and the fair value hedges should go up about 37 basis points, point-to-point in 2025. That's
if rates don't even change. So, that's probably very positive from there.
So, we have a lot of good things going on, plus we're growing loans. Even when we were shrinking CRE, we were
able to eke out loan growth. So, our businesses are performing really well, both on the CRE and C&I side, as well
as our consumer businesses. So, I would say, we have positive mix benefit as we move forward as we continue
to grow that. So, that gives me a lot of confidence that NII, net interest margin should continue to improve.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Just question on – you mentioned the criticized loans decline. Just wondering, do we need rates to go much lower
for CRE criticized loans to come down over the coming quarters? And could we see a big, like, stairstep decline at
some point early next year when you, I don't know, get updated appraisals, financials from these borrowers? And
what are the implications? Does it really change your thought process as a result on the 11% CET1 or where the
reserve ratio is today at 1.60?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ebrahim. What I would tell you is this quarter, I pointed out in the prepared
remarks, the biggest difference in the third quarter versus the past several quarters is that we actually had a lot of
upgrades in our roles. When rates fall, we can have more takeouts and paydowns from that and that's occurring,
obviously, with rates coming down. But we're getting actually good upgrades now. If you look specifically in our
healthcare sector that we had, the operations really started to improve. Their occupancy and rents were more
positive and they were cash flowing better and that's really positive. You have to remember that in our criticized
book that we have in total, 91% is paying in current. So, that's really, really good.
If you look at our CRE construction book, that also dropped a fair amount and that was really driven by interest
rates and also just stabilization that you're seeing in the marketplace the projects that we have. One of the
strengths M&T has with all of our lending is really that the clients that we lend to. We really have really strong
client selection and people are committed supporting their credits and believe that they're the right things they
want to hold on to them, and you're seeing that really come through and you're seeing this now come through as
we're starting to get upgrades.
The other thing that we saw this quarter is our RV dealers – had three significant RV dealers. They were able to
get rid of their excess inventory in 2022 and that really helped from an upgrade perspective. So, we have a lot of
momentum in criticized. I'm very optimistic fourth quarter will continue to be a very strong and continue into 2025.
So, I think we have momentum there and probably won't be a direct line down, Ebrahim. But I think the trajectory
is definite down, I feel very positive about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. And just maybe, Daryl, so you mentioned drivers of loan growth. You had pretty good C&I growth the
last few quarters. Is this still coming through partly driven by the People's acquisition and kind of the footprint you
acquired there? And are we done with the run-off in CRE? Could that kind of flat line from here or is that still going
to be declining somewhat from third quarter levels?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So, let me start with the CRE first. So, our pipelines are building in CRE. We haven't had large pipelines for
a while there. So, it's going to take us probably a couple quarters for those pipelines to fill up and start seeing it hit
on the balance sheet. But we are making really good progress in our CRE portfolio and that gives me confidence
as we get into 2025 we won't be shrinking CRE, but we'll be growing CRE. So, it's another oar in the water that
will give us more momentum from a revenue growth perspective from that. So, I think that's very positive.

M&T Bank Corp.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
As far as growth this quarter, it was continued growth. I mean, our specialty businesses that we have, corporate
and institutional, fund banking, mortgage, warehouse, franchise, all were really strong growers this quarter. When
you saw the quarter play out, we were a little soft in the first part of the quarter, but we finished the quarter really
strong. You can see it in end of period loan balances, and we have a lot of momentum going into the fourth
quarter. So, that's good. When you look at our regions that we have, our middle-market, the areas that really are
to highlight there are Austin and Baltimore; New Jersey; York, PA; Richmond, Virginia. All those continue to
progress and go really be positive. So, I would say we have good momentum in the lending side and feel good
about the revenue projections that we have.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it, thanks. Just one follow-up on the previous response you gave to Gerard. If we don't get a rate cut in the
fourth quarter in November, December, or at least one of those, does that change your outlook on the NII, NIM
from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. Everything I said going through that list, Ebrahim, was structural that's going on in our balance sheet that
has no impact on interest rates. So, I feel comfortable that we're going up if rates stay flat or if they actually go up
or down. We're relatively neutral from a interest rate risk percentage and it's hard to be exact, but we're as neutral
as you can be with a balance sheet and the complexities that you have. So, I feel good that we have an upward
trajectory in margin and net interest income.

So, I wanted to ask on deposit betas. I think you noted that you're assuming a 40% deposit beta in 4Q. Now,
deposit betas on the way up or closer to the mid-50s, if I recall correctly. So, do you expect that betas will
10


M&T Bank Corp.
(MTB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
accelerate from 4Q as you go into next year and as we see more rate cuts and get closer to the betas that you
saw on the way up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. I think of it, maybe it's my simple mind or whatever. But I think that if our betas went up, I think we peaked
at about 55%. On the way down, we'll probably end up at 55% at some point. It's really the pace and how quickly
you get there. But I felt really good about what we've been able to do at the end of September and feel good that
we'll have a good, at least a 40% beta repricing down in the fourth quarter and that hopefully will continue to move
forward as we get into 2025. But all things being equal, I don't think we're going back to where we were. But I feel
very positive that our businesses are lowering rates with a lot of good planning that we had in the company, our
treasury team with all the businesses worked really hard to come up with good strategies and really good
implementation, and we've tested that and feel really good at where we're headed.

Got it. And then, just on in terms of the loan growth you were just speaking about, as we get into next year, I
mean, it sounds like loan growth will accelerate as you start to build those CRE loans. In terms of funding that
loan growth, do you expect to grow deposits in line with loan growth next year or is there room to bring down the
cash balances? I noticed that they didn't go down that much this quarter. Is there some room to utilize cash
balances and maybe grow deposits a little bit slower next year?

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Well, Manan, I'm a big believer that we want to operate the company being always on. When I say always on,
what that means is we are always out there trying to get deposits from all of our customers. We won't pay the
highest rates, we won't pay the lowest rates, but we'll always be out there asking for deposits. We've had four
consecutive quarters of customer growth and deposits. We will continue to focus on growing customer deposits. I
think it's important, if you think of a boat, if you're growing loans, you need to grow deposits so you don't go in a
circle and all that. So, you need to continue to move going forward. I would actually like to grow deposits faster
than loans, to be honest with you and continue to shrink some of our noncore funding if we're able to do that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. So, it sounds like that core deposits continue to grow you'll pay down some of the noncore funding and
would the securities balances grow as well as you move away from cash or would you expect to stay at this level
of cash?

Daryl N. Bible A

If you look at where we are right now, we have about $59 billion between the two. We are putting more money
into the investment portfolio. Again, we've been very methodical all year and increasing our investment portfolio
increases and that's played out really well for us. You saw we had nice increases, will probably be in the 3.90s
towards the end of the year, early first quarter and 4% sometime in 2025 from a yield perspective. So, we will
continue to grow our investment portfolio. We have $1 billion in maturity in the fourth quarter. We'll probably invest
$3 billion in the fourth quarter, and then we'll reevaluate and see how 2025 plays out.

From a cash at the Fed perspective, we probably will operate with cash at Fed. No, at $20 billion, we won't
probably go much lower than that. But I think we just have a lot of flexibility where we are right now. Right now,
we're sitting on about $25 billion-plus at the Fed. So, we got a lot of flexibility.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, sorry about that. Just for the loans in the fourth quarter relative to period end of $136 billion, just is there
upside to that if CRE stabilizes or do you see some more out – some little bit more run-off and paydowns in that
portfolio and then stabilizing into 2025?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. I think you're going to see run-off in CRE for at least a couple more quarters. First quarter for sure, fourth
quarter, first quarter, maybe second quarter. It depends on how quickly our pipelines build and what type of loans
that we're making whether it's permanent or construction loans from that perspective. But we're kind of going to
operate with about 20% of our loan book being in CRE is kind of a mix that we're going to have moving forward
from that projection. So, it's – pipelines are building and Peter and his team will do a great job and try to meet the
needs of our clients and communities as we move forward. So – but we'll do it the right way. But I wouldn't expect
CRE balances to grow until mid-next year conservatively.

Okay. And then, during the quarter you said that a 200 basis point lower in rates could actually effectively wipe
out the criticized loans in the CRE. Do I have that correct? And if so, then just kind of getting back to the earlier
questions like the timing, is it that last [audio gap] (00:38:26)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A

Yeah. I got the first part, I didn't get the last part, Chris.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Sure. Apologies about the connection. Just – what's the timing of that – if you do get 200 basis points lower in the
curve, what's the timing for the benefits on the criticized CRE?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So, we have a good downward trajectory in criticized. I don't like to use the word wipe out. I don't think
that's appropriate. We have a long-term history, Chris, of working with our clients and staying with them when
things are stressful, and we will continue to do that, as long as they support their loans that I will. So, we're always
going to have some criticized loans. That's just who we are. It's in our DNA. It also makes our clients very loyal to
us. So, that's going to continue from that perspective. But I do feel really good fourth quarter trajectory down. I do
believe that we will continue with a good trajectory down in 2025 and all that. But we aren't going to "wipe out"
criticized balances.

Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
On the deposit front, appreciate the outlook on the beta that 40% you mentioned. I was curious on what your
thoughts were on the noninterest-bearing deposit piece as a part of that deposit outlook. I know you're still running
off broker deposits, so that's a part of that decline that you've been talking about for 4Q. But are you factoring in a
little bit more run-off on noninterest-bearing side within that? And can you talk about how close we are to a trough
in those deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
So, when you look at our noninterest bearing, I would say that the commercial and consumer side has really
slowed down significantly. There might be a little bit of disintermediation that occurs, but I wouldn't say very much
as we move forward. I think what you have, though, in our noninterest bearing is just a function of who we are, is
that we have balances from our ICS business, and those balances tend to be volatile. And sometimes you see
swings of that going back and forth. We will try to point those out and all that, but you're going to have some
volatility with that.
But I think for the most part, what we said several quarters ago that we thought we'd average around 30%
noninterest bearing, I think that's playing out when you exclude our broker deposits from that perspective. So, I
feel really good from a noninterest-bearing perspective.
And I think the thing, as you look forward, that the value of free deposits as rates come down is less. So, we have
to work harder to keep our interest rate spreads and margins higher just because you aren't getting as much
benefit from a noninterest bearing. And we're aware of that, we're definitely keen into how that plays out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. Great, thanks. Switching to loan growth, appreciated all the color you gave on the drivers for 3Q. I think you
mentioned those more specialty lines and that middle-market utilization was actually down a little bit. When do
you expect that utilization to start to move up more meaningfully? I mean, if you could just talk about the
competitive landscape within C&I overall, that'd be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. Well, within commercial, we did have the increase, like I said, in our dealer services. Seems like there's a
lot more cars on the lots now which is driving that utilization up, but net-net, it's still down. Some of it could be
postelection. That's what people seems to be defaulting to when you talk to clients in the marketplaces. And in the
markets we serve, we have a lot of good things going on in the marketplaces, and I think there will be a lot of
growth needs over time. It's just a matter of when that will happen. It's hard to actually pin that down, to be honest
with you, Dave. But we are working as hard as we can and we're there for our clients when they need us. If you
look at lines, our lines actually continue to grow. So, we're actually making more lines available for our clients. So,
we are growing our customers and accounts from that perspective, and eventually, they will start to draw on them.

Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I know there's – I guess, just one last one on loan growth. I mean, I know there's a lot of moving parts here. You
mentioned the $136 billion in average for next quarter, which would be sort of 1% growth linked quarter. Do you
think that's a pretty good bogey, even – going forward from there? As you talk about pipelines building, maybe
CRE has a couple more quarters to trough. Is that a decent bogey or do you think you could see quarterly growth
maybe even accelerate from that sort of 1% linked quarter on annualized number?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
We are still in the midst of our planning season for 2025, Frank. I would love to tell you that answer right now. I
would say, it's anywhere to maybe a little bit less than 1% continuously to maybe a little bit more than 1%, 1%
might be an average, give or take. We're going to do the right thing and support our customers and the
communities. That's the most important thing we do from that. We are very selective in the customers that we do
business with from that. But that said, we will get as much growth as we think is prudent out in the marketplace.
We aren't going to stretch or change our credit levels and all that. So, we'll just see how it plays out, but I'll give
you more color on that at next earnings call.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, fair enough. And then, you also talked about the repricing of the back book, and I think you just mentioned
kind of on the security side where you think yields could get to. If we – just for modeling purposes, we think about
the loan book repricing, you set aside rate movements for a minute and just – any sort of color you could give in
terms of where we sit now with rates where they are currently, what you're seeing – or what the sort of pickup is
on a quarterly basis on loan yields from the repricing of the back book.

Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So, I'll give you a high level of what we're seeing on this past quarter. So, when you look at our C&I
portfolio and we look at – these are all fixed rate loan categories. The C&I fixed rate loan is averaging up about
1% on what's rolling off/rolling on. The CRE is averaging up about 1.3%. Mortgage is averaging about little over
2%, consumers at about 1.4%. Net-net, if you blend that altogether of all the fixed rate loans rolling on/rolling off,
it's around 150-basis-point benefit.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
In terms of expenses, I mean, you put up some pretty good operating leverage this quarter. It looks like your
outlook implies some continued positive operating leverage near-term. Could you give us your thoughts as you
look into 2025 what type of acceleration in that positive operating leverage is possible? I believe right now the
street's looking at about 150 to 200 basis points positive operating leverage for you guys as we look into the full-
year 2025. Curious on your thoughts on what you believe is achievable.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So, we're still putting 2025 together. I do believe we will have positive operating leverage for 2025. Whether
we're 150 or 200 basis points, I think you're in the neighborhood of where plan will end out, but we are on 100%
have it all kind of figured out and everybody's agreed to it, but we will get there. I feel very confident we will get
there from that. If you look at the expenses that we guided, they were up a little bit in the fourth quarter and that's
mainly due to projects that we have. We have a fair amount of projects going on in the company, and we're
making a lot of progress. We do have an increase there.
The other thing that we're doing is we've had a pretty good year from a performance perspective, both financially.
We've made good progress on our asset quality and good loan and deposit growth and just improving and getting

good some of our priorities accomplished. So, we actually are increasing our corporate-wide incentives in fourth
quarter for payout for everybody for a good year. That said, I still feel that 2025 is going to be a better year than
2024, to be honest with you. We continue to have a lot more work to do and make progress, but we have a lot of
positive momentum now and need to reward the people that are making it happen in the company and feel good
about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Great. All right, thank you. That's helpful. And then, on the credit side, your loan loss reserve ratio as a
percentage of loans ticked down a bit or so this quarter, I guess, at around 162 basis points where it stands now.
Where do you see that trending here? You cited the expected decline in criticized that you'll see in the quarter and
then pretty good trajectory there. Fair to assume continued modest decline here in that ratio? Is that fair to
assume as you look out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. I think when you look at it, this past quarter, we had some good macro factor positives, with [ph] CREPI
(00:49:07) being much more positive and that helped drive a downward drop in criticized, which is good. I think as
you look forward though, we are growing all of our lending categories. So, you would have a mix change that
you're seeing occur in the balance sheet, and that mix change is more heavy on the consumer side. Consumers
definitely have, for the most part, higher overall spreads and yields, but they also come with higher net charge-
offs. So, you're seeing a mix change.
So, right now, it's – we're feeling really good where we're operating right now around 40%. Could it be a little
lower than that? Maybe. Could it be a little bit higher than that? Possibly. It really depends on how quick that mix
change happens. We look at it obviously from a net overall spread and making sure we're getting the good returns
on the assets that we're putting on our balance sheet. So, it's a good capital use for our shareholders. So, we
think we're doing the right thing from that perspective. But I think it's the mix shift that could potentially play out
over the next couple of years of having just a little bit higher charge-off company as we get a little bit more
diversified.
John, we are really trying to be a much more diversified company, not so much 100% relying on CRE. We never
were 100%, but really try to have much more diversification. So, we have strong consumer businesses, C&I
businesses, as well as CRE businesses, and a lot of great fee businesses like ICS and wealth out in the
marketplace. So, we're really – if you look at all the things that we present at the investors and all that, it's really
talking more of a diversified company as we move forward.

Nathan Stein Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, all. This is Nathan Stein on behalf of Matt O'Connor. I wanted to ask about the NIM trajectory, given it came
in strong this quarter at 3.62% and you expect it to be low 3.60s next quarter. So, this is above your prior guide to
be in the high 3.50s in the second half of the year. In September, I think you'd said a 3.60% range NIM makes
sense for next year. Have your thoughts changed regarding the NIM trajectory given how strong it's been to-date?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
So, what I would tell you is that I think we feel comfortable in the low 3.60s for a fourth quarter margin, and we'll
give you 2025 guidance in January when we do our next earnings call that feel really positive about the
momentum we have, good repricing and reactivity on the deposit side. It is really going well and good roll on and
roll off rates on our fixed rate loan assets as well. So, I think we have a lot of positive momentum.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan Stein Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay, great. And then kind of a nuanced question, but other revenue was in line with 2Q levels, and I think you
had previously suggested it would come down a bit on lower syndication revenues and interchange fees. Did
those come in a bit better than you had expected or was it something else that kind of helped these? And then,
how do you expect this fee line to trend going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. I would say that within the other, the two largest categories are loan syndications and merchant and card
fees. Those tend to be going very well and that's really what drives that other category are those two line items for
the most part.

It's a mix, Zach. Some of the things that come online, like our new data centers that we're putting on are coming
online fourth quarter, that's going to be in run rate. We also have some project expenses that we have that are
more being expensed in the fourth quarter from that. So, it's really a mix that we have there. We'll give you 2025
guidance in January and give you good projections. But like I said, I think we're going to have good, strong,
positive operating leverage in 2025. So, I feel good about that, and we'll give you more specifics as we get in
January.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary Westerlind Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Helpful, appreciate that. And then, just on the credit front, clearly you guys have made a bunch of progress with
better net charge-offs trending down, credit quality trends looking pretty good. Can you just remind us how you
think about through-the-cycle charge-off number if you're able to kind of share your thoughts around that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
So, if you look historically, our through-the-cycle charge-off is 34 basis points, but what I said on an earlier
question is that the mix of our loan portfolio is changing. And as that portfolio mix changes, having more
consumer as a percentage of total loans, that will drive higher just allowance balances. It's still good. We look at it
to make sure that we have a good net spread on those loans, good capital return on the loans that we're making
there. So, it's nothing to be concerned about. It's just that it's a mix change that you have as we continue to be a
more diversified company moving forward.
