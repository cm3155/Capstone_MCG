This morning's speakers include our CEO, Bryan Jordan; our CFO, BJ Losch and our Chief Credit Officer, Susan
Springfield.

D. Bryan Jordan
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Aarti. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. I hope that everyone is staying
healthy and safe in this environment. The COVID-19 health crisis is certainly unprecedented and causing
significant economic uncertainty across the world not to mention here in the United States. While early in the
game, I'm encouraged by the efforts of the Federal Reserve to provide liquidity and orderly markets and the
stimulus passed by the Congress and signed by President Trump.
Before we go into the quarterly trends, I'll talk about how we're responding to the COVID-19 crisis. We're focused
on supporting the well-being of our employees, our customers and our communities. For our employees, we
provided resources and flexibility to work remotely and offered extra sick time and financial assistance for
childcare. We understand how critical the role of banks is now and our employees are working incredibly hard to
support customers and our communities. Our bankers are proactively reaching out to customers to discuss
challenges and solutions. We're participating in the PPP program. So far, we've approved approximately 5,500
applications and processed $1.6 billion of loans. We're also working with our customers to provide payment
deferrals, liquidity loans and fee waivers.
On slide 5, our business diversification combined with our strong capital and liquidity gives us a position of
strength from which to successfully manage through the current economic challenges. First quarter results
demonstrated our solid foundation. PPNR was up 19% year-over-year and reasonably steady linked-quarter,
driven by profitable balance sheet growth, strong countercyclical business performance and excellent expense
management.
Earnings however were impacted by a $145 million loan loss provision, building reserves to incorporate the steep
decline in the economic outlook in March. We also adopted CECL accounting rule on January 1st. Net charge-offs
remain modest, or $7 million in the quarter.
We will continue to closely monitor and evaluate COVID-19's potential impact on the economy, our customer base
and our loan portfolio. Our current loan loss allowance represents 74% of 2019 stress test losses over a nine
quarter period. As the full impact of the economic shutdown becomes clearer, we will make appropriate
adjustments if necessary.
Balance sheet trends were strong with period-end loan and deposit growth of $2.3 billion and $2 billion
respectively linked-quarter. Loan growth was driven by increases in loans to mortgage companies and higher line
draws. Low rates drove an uptick in volume and loans to mortgage companies and draws increased from
customers preparing for economic uncertainty.
Period-end deposits reflected significant customer inflows. So far, in April we've seen deposit growth continue
while line draws have moderated. We've also seen some decline in loans to mortgage companies which
increased sharply in the last week of March. Our capital and overall liquidity position remained strong with excess
funding capacity that will allow us to continue to utilize our balance sheet to support our customers' needs. Our
period-end capital ratios were impacted by an increase in risk weighted assets primarily due to loan growth
combined with an incremental provision bills.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
I'll give a quick update on our merger and branch acquisition before turning the call over to BJ to provide more
financial details. A merger of equals with IBERIABANK is on track. We've made good progress in integration
planning and processes and we've completed initial regulatory and shareholder filings. Our shareholder votes
were set for April 24 and the two major proxy advisory firms recommended votes for the merger. We anticipate
closing the merger by the end of the second quarter of 2020 after final regulatory approval.
Regarding the branch acquisition, we've agreed with Truist to postpone finalizing the transaction until the third
quarter due to the ongoing pandemic situation. The postponement will alleviate customer disruption in this
uncertain time and allow us to comply with social distancing guideline. We believe both of these transactions will
enhance our long-term value with improved funding, additional earnings accretion and capital generation.
I'll now turn the call over to BJ to go through the financial highlights. BJ?

William C. Losch III
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Great. Good morning and thanks everybody. And I will start with financial results on slide 8. Year-over-year
highlights included strong PPNR, NII growth on strong balance sheet growth and pricing discipline despite a
tightening higher fixed income revenue and excellent expense management. The NII was up year-over-year due
to strong commercial loan growth, coupled with solid deposit pricing discipline, with the linked-quarter decline
driven by lower accretion and fewer days in the quarter.
Fee income was up from continued strong performance from our fixed income business, average daily revenues
were $1.3 million in the first quarter, an increase of 73% year-over-year and up $200,000 per day or 19% linked-
quarter. Fixed incomes extensive distribution platform remains well-positioned to capitalize on its favorable market
conditions in today's environment. The implementation of the new CECL loan loss methodology, this quarter
which as you know is supposed to be an estimate of lifetime losses in the credit portfolio contributed to a much
higher provision from $8 million in the fourth quarter to $145 million in the first.
Net charge-offs were again very low at only $7 million in the quarter with the additional provision increase driven
by future economic factors in the models related to the COVID-19 pandemic. I'll get into more details on the
reserve increase in a few minutes.
Balance sheet trends were again strong on both the loan and deposit side particularly in the last five weeks of the
quarter. As you can see on Slide 9, we saw significant increases in our period-end loans with the vast majority of
the growth occurring in the last week of the quarter. Linked-quarter total period-end loans were up $2.3 billion,
about $1.3 billion of the growth was related to loans to mortgage companies, about $750 million in the loan growth
associated with line draws and about $300 million was related to organic loan growth across the other commercial
and consumer portfolios.
So far in April line draws have abated, loans to mortgage companies balances are down from period-end levels,
and expected to come down about a $1.5 billion to $2 billion from period-end levels as purchase and refi volumes
declined due to COVID-19 impacts. In this uncertain environment, our job is threefold in terms of lending. Number
one, utilize the government programs particularly PPP to get funds into the hands of those who need it. Two, to
keep credit flowing to strong credit worthy borrowers, and three protect our balance sheet and capital levels. And
in this context where we're seeing the majority of our lending are in areas that tick these boxes.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Over the next quarter we expect the majority of new loan growth to be driven by PPP loans which carry 0% risk
weighting. We expect loans to mortgage companies given the industry dynamics related to COVID-19 impacts to
come down meaningfully in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion from $3.31 billion and we expect lines draws to
occur, but at lesser rates while new fundings decline and offset those incremental line draws.
Turning to the positive trends on slide 10, you see we saw strong deposit inflows towards the end of the quarter
with balances of $2 billion linked-quarter on a period-end basis. The growth was driven by $1.8 billion increase in
market index deposits. In March, we saw a significant inflow of these balances as customers exited the equity
markets and put their cash into FDIC insured accounts.
Additionally, we've executed on an additional $1.4 billion of insured network deposit contracts at attractive rates
currently between 5 basis points and 30 basis points. We've seen similar trends in April quarter-to-date deposits
which are up by about $2 billion or 5% over $3.31 billion levels. The drivers of deposit growth in April are related
to organic customer activity, consumers receiving stimulus checks, seasonal public funds and increases in non-
interest-bearing commercial deposits as customers hold more cash in addition to continued inflows of market
index deposits.
Moving on to capital on slide 12, as I noted earlier we had strong PPNR in the quarter that led to capital
generation that supported the dividend and the increase to the provision. As you can see on this slide, the decline
in CET1 ratio was due to the increase in risk-weighted assets at the end of the month, about 54 points was
related to commercial loan growth with a period-end uptick in loans to mortgage companies in addition to the
increased line draws.
About 16 basis points to the impact was related to higher market risk assets in our fixed income business. The
increase was largely driven by a large spike in value at risk due to the extreme volatility. Therefore as you all
know, capital ratios are calculated on period-end assets, not average assets. So even though average assets
were roughly $2.8 billion lower than period-end, the capital ratio calculation is sensitive to the spot balance at the
end of the quarter.
To put the impact of the period-end run up in assets in perspective, the rule of thumb for us is that about a $450
million increase in RWA is equal to about 10 basis point capital ratio impact. Therefore, that increase in $2.8
billion in period-end assets over the last five weeks of the quarter versus the average assets in the quarter is
about a 65 basis point impact to the CET 1 ratio. Said in different way, if CET 1 was calculated on average risk-
weighted assets versus period-end, our CET 1 ratio would have been about 9.2%.
As I've said earlier when talking about loan growth, we expect risk-weighted assets to go down in the second
quarter as loans to mortgage company balance sheet declined and new loan growth is driven primarily by 0%
risk-weighted PPP loans. With the expected reduction in RWA combined with continued strong PPNR, we would
expect our standalone CET 1 ratio to move back more towards the 9% range in the second quarter.
Slide 13, shows the drivers that changed under CECL adoption. As you know CECL replaces the incurred loss
methodology with a life of loan estimate concept. While net charge-offs were only $7 million in the quarter, the
initial day one impact and the so-called economic factors related to the future economic outlook drove the
aggregate increase in our reserves.
To put numbers to it, as you can see in the walk-forward, the ending reserve as of 12/31/2019 was $200 million.
We've [indiscernible] (00:14:23) day one impact as of 01/01/2020 of $106 million. And subsequently by quarter-
end, even though we had very little change in portfolio characteristics, some things such as charge-offs, changes

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
or loan growth in the quarter following $12 million and the economic factors, the associated changes in the future
economic outlook led to an additional $126 million of reserves, resulting in the lending loan loss reserve balance
at $444 million as of March 31. We believe this represents a healthy reserve, particularly when compared to both
peers and our own severely adverse stress test, which you can see on slide 14.
Turning to slide 14, there are several key points that I'd like to highlight here. First, as [ph] noted in the top of the
list (00:15:17), our total loan portfolio is predominantly, commercially oriented at 75% of total loans with a
meaningful portion of them about 42% considered investment grade equivalent. And within that, 20% of those
commercial loans at quarter-end were loans to mortgage companies, which as we've discussed many times carry
minimal credit risk. 90% of loan to mortgage company balances are collateralized with government guaranteed
loans. While these loans are commercial loans and therefore carry a 100% risk-weighting, if held individually on
our balance sheet, there would be 50% risk-weighted. It is a very high quality portfolio. Second, the consumer
loans that we have are of high quality as well, as evidenced by the high average refreshed FICO scores and the
lack of a meaningful higher loss content credit card exposure.
Third, about 12% of our total loan portfolio still has $65 million of unamortized loan mark in addition to $42 million
of reserves which provides additional loss absorption capacity. And finally, as you can see on the right hand side
of this slide, our reserve coverage to total loans and to Q1 annualized net charge-offs are very healthy relative to
peers and we have prudently built reserves that equate to 74% of our severely adverse modeled losses well
above the peer averages. And if you add in the additional $65 million of unamortized loan mark, we're at
approximately 85% of our severely adverse modeled losses, a very healthy number.
Turning to slide 15. Since this is both the first quarter using the new CECL methodology and the factors related to
the future economic outlook are such large drivers of both the size of the aggregate loan loss reserve and the first
quarter provisions, we thought it might be helpful to give you some details on our economic assumptions. As few
other regional banks, we utilize various Moody's scenarios and wait them to arrive at our quantitative modeled
outputs. We then use more severe scenarios on specific portfolios as wanted to come up with additional
qualitative overlays to the modeled results.
So as you can see on this slide 15 in the upper left, our most heavily weighted baseline scenario has the following
characteristics, it considers the COVID-19 pandemic impacts including the CARES Act, the Fed stimulus including
the open ended quantitative easing as well as the various announced liquidity and credit facility programs. It
assumes the fourth stimulus in 4Q 2020, the recession starting already in the first half of this year with only a
partial bounce back in the third quarter then slow growth with acceleration of GDP growth not occurring till later in
2021 and no return to full employment until 2023. For certain select portfolios, we still might have more stress
such as aspects of the restaurant franchise finance or hospitality portfolios. We used more severe Moody's
scenarios with characteristics such as in the upper right. At the bottom, we also laid out for you the
epidemiological assumptions that corresponded with our various weighted scenarios.
Then on slide 16, we thought it might be helpful to graph out some of the key economic assumptions driving the
loss estimates and compare them to our stress test assumptions. On each of these graphs, you have five lines,
the lighter dotted lines are the individual upside baseline and downside scenarios utilized, the heavy blue line is
the weighted average of the scenarios we utilize across our portfolios and the heavy grey line is the 2019 stress
test assumptions, few observations that I make here. First, on rates assumptions such as for the three-month
treasury yield and fed funds, they're very similar. On both GDP and unemployment, the current weighted
scenarios showed a deeper GDP drop and steeper spike in unemployment initially, but over the following 18
months, the severely adverse assumptions are worse for longer. And for key price indexes, such as CRE or home
prices or the Dow index for equity markets, the stress test assumptions are worse of near and longer term.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Well, the outlook obviously remains uncertain, a key difference between the stress test assumptions and the
current environment to be determined is the ultimate effectiveness of the massive Federal Reserve liquidity
programs and the unprecedented financial stimulus programs via the CARES Act. Regardless, with our reserves
as of 3/31/2020 at 74% of our severely adverse modeled stress test losses, we believe we have been proactive in
building healthy loan loss reserves for an uncertain environment.
Wrapping up this section on slide 17, I wanted to remind you of our stress test results to show the resiliency of our
business. First, our PPNR earnings power remained strong due to our countercyclical business and fixed income
and we are seeing that countercyclicality play out currently. And second, the lower loss content mix of our credit
portfolio with a meaningful portion of C&I and very low risk loans to mortgage companies and underweight CRE
portfolio and a de minimis credit card portfolio should serve us well in a stressed environment.
With that, I'll turn it over to Susan to give you a little bit more color on our credit portfolio.

Susan L. Springfield
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Thanks, BJ. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with slide 19, which gives an overview of how our loan portfolio has
evolved over the past 10 years since the last financial crisis. Since 2009, we have meaningfully reduced our real
estate exposure and exited certain riskier portfolios. As BJ said, our loan portfolio is now commercially-oriented
with more than 40% of our loans [ph] would map (00:21:53) to an investment grade rating and the portfolio is
diversified by product, categories and geography.
[ph] Note (0022:02) also on this slide our low CRE to total capital ratios versus peers. During this time, we felt
[indiscernible] (00:22:12) and credit leadership with significant experience in underwriting. Within our commercial
loan portfolio, specialty areas comprised about half of that. This specific industry knowledge about these teams
allows us to have strong client selection and strong underwriting discipline and will provide expertise in navigating
through this unprecedented economic crisis.
Now, I'll turn to slide 20. This slide shows the detail of our commercial loans portfolio based on NAICS industry
codes. Our loan balances are across several sectors in C&I. We've also broken up certain commercial real estate
balances as well as – as well. The overall [ph] free (00:22:59) portfolio is diversified across property types and
geography. We remain disciplined in acquiring significant equity across property types and have sized new loan
amounts in our CRE book using a minimum underwriting rate that was typically 200 basis points or more higher
than the prevailing rates at the time of underwriting. This type of underwriting built some conservatism into the
portfolio at the initial origination. Across all our portfolios, we believe we've taken the right approach to risks and
have been prudent in our credit disciplines.
I'll go over some of the specific portfolios in the next three slides. On slide 21, first take a look at healthcare
portfolio. It's diversified among physicians' offices, medical centers, hospitals and residential facilities. This $1.6
billion of average balances includes the healthcare specialty area as well as other healthcare related loans on our
balance sheet. The energy portfolio is $735 million or about 2% of our total loan portfolio. About half of the energy
portfolio is comprised of reserve based loans with approximately 70% of reserve based borrower revenues
hedged through 2020, and with approximately 50% hedged through 2021. The remainder of energy portfolio is
diversified between midstream, compression, refineries, terminals, storage and other oil field services.
[indiscernible] (00:24:34) with the price volatility in the energy market, these are portfolios that we discussed on a
very regular basis.

On slide 22, I'll go with the hospitality and restaurants portfolios. The hospitality portfolio is about $600 million with
roughly three quarters of it related to hotel. In this hotel portfolio, more than 90% of flagged hotels [ph] and are
(00:24:58) predominantly business traveler oriented with very few properties and reserve – resort destination
categories. The average loan size for our hotel loans is about $14 million. The restaurant portfolio is $1.3 billion of
average balances and includes the $1 billion franchise finance specialty area. These borrowers are experienced
business owners and have typically had access to multiple sources of capital and where about 70% of our
borrowers have more than 20 locations.
As we've talked about previously, about two-thirds of this portfolio is limited service meaning fast food,
representing well known concepts. The full service restaurants are mostly family style restaurants and have
limited exposure to fine dining. I should note that the franchisors are working closely with their franchisees during
this time in a number of ways, deferring discounting or waiving marketing fees and royalty fees, lowering prices on
supplies that are provided by the franchisor. So, in addition to the government programs, we are seeing work
across different segments trying to help businesses during this difficult time.
On slide 23, I will talk about loans to mortgage companies, one of our special key areas that we talk about every
quarter, period-end balances were $5.7 billion. As BJ noted earlier, over a $1 billion of the growth came in the last
five days of the quarter, the growth reflected elevated levels of typical month end increases driven by -- large by
increased refinance activity. Loans to mortgage companies are countercyclical business since loan rates tend to
drive mortgage activity. The loans to mortgage companies include collateral that are 90% government guarantee
mitigating most of the credit risk.
As BJ noted earlier, if these loans were directly on our balance sheet, they would require only a 50% percent risk
weighting. We have over 25 years of experience in this business and our balance sheet capacity, knowledge,
stringent focus on operational control and expertise have led to increased market share. With our commercially
oriented diverse loan portfolio and our consistent balanced approach to risk, in addition to our reserve build
associated with CECL adoption and the increase associated with the unknown economic impacts of COVID, we
believe we are well positioned to weather the current crisis.
I'll try turn it back to Bryan for the wrap-up.

Thank you, Susan. On 25 -- slide 25, we're excited about our merger of Equals with IBERIABANK. We see it is
clearly transformative. We've made a great deal of progress planning the integration. The merger strengthens our
presence in key markets, diversifies our loan portfolio both geographically and in industry concentrations, and it
gives us a unique – a unique opportunity to drive greater efficiency.
From the day we announced the merger, we've each been comfortable with the combined loan portfolios and
while the economy has changed due to the coronavirus pandemic, I believe together we are a stronger and better
institution positioned to drive attractive shareholder returns and strong earnings accretion.
While these are clearly unusual times, I believe we are well prepared to deal with the fall out of COVID-19. We
have a strong capital and liquidity base. We've maintained consistently strong underwriting standards and have
built a diversified portfolio that is focused on profitability, and our loan loss allowance is strong. We have good
expense controls in place, and very importantly we have solid underlying earnings power.

I wanted to start on reserves. If we look at the 2Q reserve build, it seems fairly aggressive in terms of the reserve
covering 74% of DFAST losses which is well above peers. Now we look at most banks, they're at risk for another
sizable reserve increase in 2Q just given the outlook and the economy seems to have worsened since 3/31/2020.
How do you guys think about this for First Horizon? Do you think you're at risk also or do you feel like with the
assumptions you've made which seem more harsh than others that you've gotten ahead of the curve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey Steve, its BJ. Good morning. So, we, obviously, as I talked about, use the Moody's economic scenarios
which were done very late in the quarter. And then, even through April, we continue to monitor the economic
assumptions [ph] until (00:31:39) while we ran our models using weightings from the Moody's scenarios. As I
talked about earlier, we also overlaid qualitative reserves on top of those specifically stressed sectors to make
sure that we were trying to take into account as much as we knew at the end of the quarter to be able to build as
9

healthy a reserve and try to follow what is supposed to be the [ph] role (00:32:12) around CECL which is truly
estimating your lifetime losses as of a period ending.
And so, with all of those factors, we try to be as we tried to be over the last 10 plus years very prudently
conservative in terms of transparency and how we built those reserves. And so, as you talked about, we've built it
much more towards a severely adverse environment. Clearly, the unknown going forward is what does the
economy ultimately do? How do borrowers actually behave? How do the stimulus programs and the
unprecedented Fed programs ultimately soften the impact? But, those are hopeful and what we wanted to do is
make sure that we were building as healthy a reserve as we possibly could right now. So, next quarter, as we
would in any given quarter, we'll re-evaluate our existing portfolio and the portfolio changes as well as any new
economic factors over the next 90 days and re-evaluate. But the bottom line is, we feel very good about the
healthy reserves that we built this quarter.

D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Hi, Steve. This is Bryan. To add on to BJ's comment, this is an environment that we sit around and we like the
rest of the world clearly have a lot of things, we don't know what we don't know, and maybe more than any other
environment in my career, there are more known [ph] and (00:33:57) unknowns than we've seen at any point in
time. And [ph] as you (00:34:04) – really if you go back to the 2007, 2008, 2009 timeframe was to make sure that
we provide as much transparency about what's in our portfolios and we try to be realistic, not overly conservative,
but realistic and conservative about what we think the lifetime losses are in the portfolio and lay that out for our
investor base and our regulators as well.
At the end of the day, our risk profile is very, very different today than it was in 2008, 2009, and 2010 but we've
taken the same approach which is to be realistic to take what we do think the economic environment looks like
and as BJ said use a Moody's baseline in those portfolios that we think will be adversely impacted, use more
severe scenarios around them, but again, [ph] provide (00:34:54) transparency and be realistic about how we
think it plays now. As BJ said, facts on the ground is unchanged, we're all going to know a lot more in 90 days and
we know that the day we're going to know a lot more are 180 days and we'll make adjustments as necessary.

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
That's helpful. Maybe for Susan, can you give us a sense as to the loans which you provided deferrals,
modifications in the quarter, maybe the overall balance and maybe some color on which segments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Certainly. So, if I look at the deferrals that we provided, business purpose deferrals was beyond about $3.3 billion
worth of underlying loan balances, of that about $600 million would be what I consider small business, the two
biggest portfolios as you would imagine, we had about $850 million in CRE or about 20% of the CRE book and
about – [ph] not quite (00:35:56) 40% of the franchise finance and then the remainder within just what I would call
core C&I. So, we are dedicated to working with these great customers who are experiencing this difficulty relating
to the pandemic and believe that this could be a factor in addition to the government programs that can help get
them beyond this point.
In addition to that on the consumer side, we have had deferrals on traditional consumer of about $256 million of
balances and mortgage about $230 million.

Okay. And then finally for BJ, I know it's almost impossible to forecast the margin here, but in terms of just the
ability to absorb losses, can you talk about -- do you think you can grow net interest income in the coming quarter
with all the pressure on NIM and offsets on PPP? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey A
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah so. We do have a slide, slide 28, if you want to look at our net interest margin and net interest income
trends in the appendix. But, yeah, I think in terms of NII, I think there is going to be continued pressure as we
expect LIBOR to continue to come down, it's remained more elevated than I think any of us would have thought
given the rapid decline in fed funds, but we expect that to continue to come down though it hasn't yet come down
to where we think it will be. So, that'll continue to be a headwind. Our teams have done an excellent job, both
taking care of customers and growing deposits, while also remaining very disciplined around pricing, whether its
base rates, earnings credit rates, promo rates, retention rates, et cetera. And as you can see in the quarter, we
brought deposit rates down quite significantly. And I would expect that to continue into the second quarter so that
will be helpful as well.
I would expect that those two -- the net impact will probably be a net negative because LIBOR and our floating
rate loans would come down more [indiscernible] (00:38:27) bring down deposit costs. But, as you said, the PPP
program particularly around the fees that we will generate from the $1.6 billion of fundings that we are making will
flow through the net interest income line and hopefully be able to offset any of the net negative in terms of the rate
dynamic. So, all of that to say is, I do think that we can hold our net interest income relatively steady with the
addition of the PPP fees.

Hi, Ebrahim.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. I guess, Bryan, just following up to your comments relative to 2008-2009, I think there's one -- like you
provided lot of details on the portfolio, like, at what point – like what's your level of comfort around the portfolio as
someone who took the bank [indiscernible] (00:39:40) to the bank in 2007, ran it through the crisis, through the
[ph] cleanup (00:39:42), when you look at the portfolio, do you see a realistic risk where losses exceed your
severe loss estimates, because I think the numbers you can all look at, you should be able to own it even if you
have $600 million instead of $440 million that you've reserved today. But just talk to us in terms of the portfolio
around and just your confidence around like that number is probably the high watermark when you think about
losses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So as I think about the portfolios today versus 2007 and 2008, I don't think there's any comparison at all.
The risk profile in the portfolio is completely different. We don't have the national business. We don't have all of
the residential construction. We don't have all of the non-footprint home equity exposures. And we didn't have a
lot of the – we don't have the corresponding portfolios that we had in 2007, 2008, 2009.
Today, we have made a very conscious effort over a 10-year period to transform the way we underwrite, the way
we document the collateral. And there was a slide, I don't recall which one, there's a slide in there BJ showed –
page 19 that shows the risk ratings and the portfolio, and sort of the evaluation, but I would suggest that I have a
very high degree of confidence in our underwriting, in our portfolio management.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
We have transformed intentionally, our mantra has been we want a portfolio that we will be proud of in any cycle
and this would qualify in any cycle and we believe that this portfolio will perform well, clearly our losses will go up
as everybody's will, but we think this portfolio will hold up and perform very, very well. And so I think it's very little
comparison to 2007, 2008 and 2010. If the framework that people are applying, how do we do in 2007, 2008 and
how we're going to perform to date, it's night and day. I think the portfolio performance will be vastly different and
vastly better in this cycle.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. Got it. And in terms of the mortgage warehouse, like 90% of the collateral government GSE-backed
mortgages, is there any risk in terms of the warehouse where a mortgage company runs into trouble, like do you
see any meaningful credit risk there or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
I really don't. We thought that 90% is government-backed, another 5% or 6% is jumbo, and really conforms in
every other way except for the loan size and a small amount of non-cumulative.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Our experience Ebrahim with those portfolios is even when we've had to manage out of a position, the collateral is
liquid, it is – we liquidated and we get out of the position and so we see it as more of an operational risk portfolio
than a credit risk portfolio. As Susan just reiterated, as you pointed out, it's a highly liquid, almost essentially a
conforming GSE eligible portfolio. So we see it as very little credit risk and it's really most important that we stay
focused on what we've always been focused on is that we have good title to good collateral.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
The other thing Ebrahim is that these mortgage warehouse customers were highly profitable through 2019 and
year-to-date 2020. And so their ability should you have a mortgage or two that can't go into the permanent
market, their ability to pull it back, amortize it, take it back from us, is their ability to do that has been increased
because of the profitability that they've had in 2019 and year to date 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And if I can sneak in one last for BJ, when I look at your amended S4 for March 9, stocks come down. Just
help us think through around, how the pro forma capital ratio tangible book looks coming out of the IBERIA deal, if
you could provide some colors that would be helpful?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So clearly with significant moves in the stock price, there's been some talk around, do you have goodwill or
do you have a bargain purchase gain in those, those types of things and really when it comes down to – it's –
none of that really fundamentally changes the tangible common equity that you'll get from the transaction.
So the tangible common equity will be the same, what's going to change as we get closer to close is clearly the
fair value marks that we're going to be looking at on a portfolio from a credit perspective or an interest rate of
liquidity mark perspective, as well as the mix of PCD, purchase credit deteriorated versus non-PCD loans in that
mix and how we'll have to account for those. So we're clearly going through all of that work right now. And as
Brian talked about we anticipate closing the transaction towards the end of the second quarter and we'll be doing
our calculations on fair value marks as of that day.

Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hi Brady.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hi Brady.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, when you look at some of the categories in your loan book that would be deemed higher risk like energy,
hotel, restaurant, healthcare. I mean none of these exposures are big for First Horizon, which is good, but when
you look at the riskier exposures, which categories are you most concerned about actually losing money as this
you know current economic status continues?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Brady, clearly we stress several portfolios were heavily as we've previously discussed. And the immediate impact
to hospitality and restaurants was significant. And then, within the healthcare sector, since all non-elective
procedures and visits who [indiscernible] (46:51) that's where we've seen the most requests for assistance, either
in deferrals or liquidity line. What we don't know as we've talked about previously is that the stimulus is healthier
and the additional stimulus that is planned to be out there with another round of PPT, the Main Street Lending
Program to specific programs for healthcare, hospitals it could in that being better than it looks right now because
we've not seen an economic environment with this much stimulants. So even while we believe those portfolios are
probably more risk-based on what's going on today which is why we did stress some of those portfolios a little bit
more heavily.
Really [indiscernible] (00:47:43) the next 90 to 180 days, I think all of us will see what is the impact. And then the
other thing that I've been thinking [Technical Difficulty] (00:47:47) as we think about managing this portfolio, not
just the – what happened during the shutdown, it's what patterns of behavior change and how does that drive
different things. So I think we will all have to go through this together and see how we emerge from the present
pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's helpful. And then you know first [indiscernible] there has been great operating leverage and
lowering its expense base and getting the efficiency ratio down. I mean, when you look at the company now
especially with what's going on with higher provision costs and the net interest margin coming in. Is there
opportunity to go back and look at the expense side even more to harvest some more savings at this point?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Hi, Brady. This is Bryan. I appreciate the confidence and our ability to manage it. I think our team has done a very
good job and we saw [indiscernible] (00:48:53) and we had in our expense base of $10 million roughly for the
increase in our reserve for unfunded commitments. If you take those things out, we showed good expense
leverage in the first quarter from fourth quarter and from a year ago. We will have a fair amount of work to do and
we think that there are opportunities to control some costs in the categories of known, unknowns it's not clear
today of what our work footprint looks like today. We have about 50% or more of our people who are working
remotely. How do we have to space people out and some of those things, but we do think that there is operating
leverage that we can get in the foreseeable future.
The other thing that I pointed out when I commented about IBERIA Bank, when we do that merger of equals, we
still feel very strongly that we can get at least $170 million of cost savings out of that combination and those are
costs that neither one of us could get at, if we weren't doing that merger. So in essence, we have a cost tailwind
by completing that merger that also allows us to restructure our entire combined cost base and so I think there is
opportunity for leverage on the cost structure, but there are some things about the operating environment that will
need another 90 days or so to figure out how it impacts us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. And then lastly for me. BJ, when you're talking about the mortgage warehouse coming down, $1.5 billion
to $2 billion, you're talking about end of period balances correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Correct. Yeah, yeah. So you saw, I think, on one of our slide Brady that literally in the last five days of the quarter,
we saw loans to mortgage companies go up by about $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion. So a huge, huge spike and we
actually show you the day by day chart from 12/31 to 3/31 of what loans from mortgage companies did. So if you
go back five weeks before the end of the quarter, it was almost $2 billion change over five weeks so significant
run out. We expect that to come back down in that $1.5 billion to $2 billion range from the period-end simply
because on the purchase side we've seen a significant backup in reduction in applications as you might expect
because of the COVID-19 pandemic and people just being very hesitant on new purchases.
And then even with refi, there's still activity out there. But a lot of it is just finishing what was already in process.
And if you think about having to do a refi there are appraisers that have to go into houses, there are title
companies and closing attorneys that actually have to be able to finalize the paperwork and with the stay at home
orders and those types of things it's made it much harder to actually get those things done. So, again the
combination of those two we believe caused the spike at the end of the quarter, but correspondingly we think will
cause a reduction of a somewhat equal amount by the end of the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey Brady, this is Bryan to add to BJ. Estimates vary, but it was something like 20% or so of the mortgage
universe can benefit from these low rates and a refi environment. And as BJ said, a lot of that started in the March
timeframe and we'll see the pull through. There are some structural issues that BJ mentioned to further refi, I think
purchase volume which is a little less than half of the day continues to decline. And quite depending on your
outlook on the economy, unemployment rates are going to have an impact on ability to refi. So we think that
there's natural downward pressure on that.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
We talk about that portfolio and its impact on the capital ratios. And as that portfolio shrank, those capital ratios go
up. One of the reasons that I don't worry in addition to the strength of the credit portfolio, about the CET 1 ratio at
a given point in time is, if the economy gets bad and that capital is more of an important factor, that mortgage
warehouse business is going to be probably a $1 billion or $2 billion portfolio. It's going to come down because
the economy is bad, those capital ratios go up in the neighborhood of 100 basis points if that happens.
So that portfolio it will ebb and flow based on the economic environment and the impact of rates. We like that
business. It is a business that has as Susan said very strong customer base and it has been very attractive to us
from a financial perspective. So we're not worried about what that portfolio does. BJ is sort of pointing out that it's
got a natural tendency down over the next couple of months. So as you're modeling don't forecast that it's almost
$6 billion in outstanding.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
So it looks like if I take those core categories that you outlined is kind of higher risk, it's about 15% of loans ex-
warehouse. Do you have a sense for what that looks like with IBERIA included, like I know their energy portfolio is
about 5.5% and you guys are about 3.5% pro-forma, but do you have a sense for A) what that would look like on
a complexion basis? And then B) would you look to maybe de-emphasize some of those portfolios or take a
bigger market potentially on those portfolios once you consummate the deal? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, I'll speak to a couple of the portfolios that you mentioned. Your energy comment was correct on a
combined basis. On a commercial real estate, in this time, our commercial real estate overall they do have a
larger commercial real estate book as a percentage of their portfolios than we do. So that will go up, but I do want
to reiterate, we did significant due diligence on each other, during the process before the merger was announced
and whilst the energy portfolio will go up somewhat, [indiscernible] (00:55:49) portfolio will go up a little bit more.
We do feel very good about the disciplined underwriting and client selection that both banks have employed. And
so I feel like, we'll be able to manage through that.
I do think there probably is an expectation that over time, as we are a bigger bank [indiscernible] (00:56:07) but
we would look for ways to continue to diversify the portfolio and clearly those could be areas where over time we
17

would want to de-emphasize the growth there doesn't want to remain open for good customers once we get
beyond this pandemic, but at the same time, that's another benefit of being a big organization is the ability to
continue to diversify. So that's really how we're thinking about that, but again pre-pandemic looking at the portfolio
is very similar approach, very disciplined approach to initial underwriting, servicing and client production.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one follow-up for me, if I look at the PPP program, just one or two questions
there. I think if I combine both you and what IBERIA announced last week, it's about $3.5 billion. How long would
you expect those loans to stick around? And then when you do combine the company, do you expect to hold
those loans as held for sale or held for investment because the way I understand is, [indiscernible] (00:57:11) for
investment it will impact the margins, but you hold it as held for sale the fees will go through non-interest income?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. On that last question, I think we've fully decided yet on which one we are going to do HFI or HFS. So we
are still working through that. I think the terms are two years, but the forgivable portion – or that is much shorter.
So we would expect them to largely just stay on the balance sheet maybe through the balance of this year,
running down towards the end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
It's got a zero risk weighting too Michael. And I think we'll also step back and look at the liquidity facility that the
Fed has provided because that looks like an attractive way to find these zero risk weighting. But as you point out
they are very low spread with a 1% coupon rate and so we've been running as I said in my transition the question.
We've been running really, really hard to get these loans under written booked and funded and so now we'll catch
our breath and we'll figure out how we finance them on the balance sheet. But we don't think it's a problem either
way, either on the balance sheet or using the fed facilities and we'll – so we will work through that over the next 30
days or so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah and forgive me for stating the obvious. But what I'm obviously talking about is that, what we just funded, if
the government does re-up the program and comes on new, we'll have it going on further. But again the way I
understand it is, the fees as well as the spreads are included in the margin, so we will – once we figure out exactly
how that's going to flow through and when you recognize the fees, we'll certainly be transparent and disclose all
of that.

Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey I apologize. I hopped on really late. So I'm sorry if you've already covered this. But I just had a question
around the fixed income business, this quarter it looks like the revenues out of that segment were up around
$14.5 million, but the expenses were up around $19 million and that there's a footnote that said that the fees were
impacted by trading losses given the extreme market volatility. So can you just, I guess, help parse out for us
what is going on but I guess behind curtain in terms of the negative operating leverage this quarter and why that
should move differently next quarter? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Hey Tyler. It's BJ. Yeah. So what we clearly saw in the quarter was the rapid change and increase in
volatility which led to our higher market risk assets because of higher value at risk. So [indiscernible] (01:00:24)
and team in fixed income did an excellent job working through our inventory and managing our exposures and
marks over the last five weeks of the quarter. But as they were repositioning the inventory and having to take
those marks those trading losses day to day were coming through the revenue side, but the actual activity of the
sales force was fully commissionable that makes sense.
So though our ABR was net, about $1.3 million in the quarter, if you take out the trading losses, the gross ADR
was more in the $1.7 million range, but netting out as trading losses it reduced the ADR. So your revenues led
lower with the higher commissionable variable comp on the other side. As they work through that inventory by the
end of the quarter, it's very much better positioned such that going forward, we believe we're going to have much
lower net trading losses and the gross ADR and the net ADR will be much more aligned. And you'll see the
normal pattern start to reemerge between our incremental revenue growth and any incremental variable comp
growth.

D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
This is Bryan. We refer to them as negative split. You heard us say in the past, we're in the moving business.
We're not in the storage business. We move these portfolios through the balance sheet. And the significant
dislocations that happened particularly in the municipal bond marketplace, some of the corporate marketplace
and the volatility that's sort of erupted in the late March timeframe was largely stabilized by the efforts of the Fed
that I mentioned earlier to bring liquidity and stability to the marketplace.
So we think the majority of that has sort of work through the systems and there were days in there we would have
volatility where we did a day I think it was about $5 million in average daily revenue that netted down to about $3
million with the negative split. So there was a lot of activity and we think that the stability in the marketplace has
largely put that behind as we think it all to move to more normalized levels depending on how things play out
more normalized levels in the second quarter. The second quarter is off to a decent start.

Tyler Stafford Q

Okay. Thanks for that Bryan and BJ. So I guess if some of these more extreme market volatility issues and
trading losses have been cured at this point, I mean do you expect I guess going back to Bryan your last
comment there, 2Q to be more towards that gross 1.7 or the net 1.3 million or somewhere in between or what's
your kind of near-term expectation and what you're seeing?

You'll have to forgive me, on the 21st day of April, I'm not going to take the bait on that one. So every stated
revenues have been good. There's couple of things that could impact the business that I think we will keep
around. One is financial institutions broadly speaking or funding PPP loans in a number of our customers until
they can put loans into the facility that will constrain liquidity, so that could have some impact on the bond
business.
And I think our total return business continues to look good. We're optimistic about the outlook for the quarter.
And as we started off 21 days or so is the trend, we're starting off in the same area we ended the first quarter and
so we feel good about the outlook, but it's way too early in the quarter and obviously there's too many unknowns
about the economy and how this is going to play out over a 90 day period.

Tyler Stafford Q

Sure. That's totally fair. Thanks Bryan. And then just one more for me, on the mortgage warehouse business, how
much of the mortgage clients or balances are to mortgage originators versus mortgage servicers?

Operator: Our next question comes from Garrett Holland of Baird. Please go ahead.

Garrett Anthony Holland Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Garrett Anthony Holland Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
I appreciate all the detail. But could you help us understand the sensitivity and the reserve level and the potential
reserve build. If you weighted the CECIL forecast more towards your downside economic assumptions versus the
baseline employee for the current reserve level at 1:3?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah so – let see to try to give you a sense of the magnitude. I think the pure downside model would probably be
doing this. I've got my head about 70% more than what the baseline would be 60% to 70% more. So I think we
took that into account in terms of A, our weightings of baseline upside and downside as well as what we talked
about particularly around the sectors where we thought they were most vulnerable to that downside and might not
have as much support from the various stimulus programs or the Fed facilities that others might have. So we took
21

all of that into account using quantitative modeling, multiple discussions on qualitative modeling and overlays and
feel comfortable about how we've looked at the aggregate reserve to this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Garrett Anthony Holland Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thanks, BJ. And then just a follow-up on IBERIA, obviously a lot of change in the micro front and change out to
the deal and heard the reiteration of the cost savings projections. So do you still feel good about the timeframe for
realizing those benefits and maybe some of the pro forma profitability metrics?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. This is Bryan. So if I take it in reverse order, can you tell me what the economy is going to be at the end of
2021 and I can tell you better about the pro forma profitability metrics. But I think over time, yes I feel very good
about our ability to get to the pro form profitability metrics. I think by 2021, we have forecasted about 75% of the
cost saves in 2021 and being at a run rate by the end of 2021. I still feel good about that and our ability to achieve
that.
It'll be interesting to see how the first year plays out. We might be a little shy in year one simply because of all of
the needs to support PPP and the market that we're in. But we think by the time we get to the end of the year
even then we will be at our 25% cost reduction level in 2020. So we still feel good about it. We still feel good
about our ability to hit the pro forma profitability numbers. We're not sure that 2021 will be or 2022 will be back to
100% economy. But given that it is we feel good about our performance
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Garrett Anthony Holland Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
That's helpful. And then just wanted to ask you a quick one about the dividend payout here, obviously capital
[indiscernible] (01:08:43) but wanted to confirm how you're thinking about that claim on capital? Thank you for
taking questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Sure. So we think that returning capital to our shareholders is important. And BJ pointed out in several
slides from the deck and in the appendix our stress testing and our stress testing through most of our adverse
scenarios, we assume that we continued with the dividend at current levels and that's our working assumption
that we continue to manage the dividend at current levels and we believe that capital adequacy is sufficient pre-
provision earnings, even net of provisions will be adequate to clearly support the return of capital to our
shareholders.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey Jennifer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thank you, good morning. Hi, Bryan what do you think the long-term implications of this pandemic shutdown are
going to be on First Horizon, whether it would be less need for office space or other implications?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. We started a good bit of time talking about that and we think there are a number of things operationally
office space and in the short run, how to clean office spaces and things of that nature. How you protect customers
that come in your financial centers, it's interesting I'm doing this off the top of my head. All of our financial centers
are open, most of the activity is happening in a Drive-Thru facility. Our transactions are down, but we're doing all
of it through Drive-Thru facilities and in some ways you almost have to smile because we're using old technology
to serve customers a drive up facility, clearly customers are using call centers, they are using online technology.
I do think that we'll have to figure out how we cope with social distancing probably for – you know you need to
believe the epidemiologists for year two maybe longer. I think people have gotten much more comfortable and
we're much more comfortable in our ability to work remotely. We've done the vast majority of the PPP work on a
remote basis. So I think, we have more people working remotely. We'll probably need less office space and
centralized facility within those spaces. We'll probably spread people out more. I think customers over time will do
less business in financial centers because they've gotten closer to technology and using the tools that are
available to them.
So I think, it is a opportunity to really rethink how we do business. And that's one of the things that as we plan for
the integration or the merger of vehicles with IBERIABANK is, we think about how does this change our business
long-term. And as we make our systems and process decisions, let's think about what this educates us about
customers and customer preference and the likelihood of doing business. So, I think more remote banking,
spread out more and more social distancing and using more technology to serve customers in unique and
different ways.
