MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings
Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. So we'll now go live to the
presentation. Please stand by.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief
Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which, as always, is
available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.
Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $4.7 billion, EPS of $1.38 and record revenue of $33.8 billion
with a return on tangible common equity of 9%. Included in these results are a number of significant items. First, a
credit reserve build of $8.9 billion and then approximately $700 million of gains in our bridge book and $500
million of gains in credit adjustments and other, both of which represent reversals of some of the losses we took in
the first quarter.
As we continue to navigate this challenging and uncertain environment, this quarter's performance once again
demonstrates the benefits of the diversification and scale of our platform. So, I'll just touch on a few highlights
here.
CIB reported its highest quarterly revenue on record with IB fees up 54% and Markets revenue up 79% year-on-
year, each representing record performances with strength across the board.
We saw record consumer deposit growth of 20%, up over $130 billion year-on-year, and firm-wide average
deposits were $1.9 trillion, up 25% year-on-year and 16% quarter-on-quarter.
Average loans were up 4% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely reflecting the COVID-related loan growth
that we saw in March. However, on an end-of-period basis, loans were down 4% quarter-on-quarter due to
revolver paydowns as well as lower balances in Card and Home Lending, partially offset by the impact of $28
billion of PPP loans.
And lastly, we increased our CET1 ratio by approximately 90 basis points in the quarter after building
approximately $9 billion of reserves and paying nearly $3 billion of common dividends. As you'll recall, we started
the second quarter on the back of unprecedented levels of business activity in March. On the following pages, I'll
give you an update on some of those key activity metrics we looked at last quarter and share what we're seeing
today. So with that, let's turn to page 2.
Starting with wholesale on the top of the page, we saw record levels of debt and equity issuance in the quarter, as
clients sought to pay down the majority of the revolver draws from March and continued to shore up liquidity while
market conditions were receptive, supported by extraordinary central bank actions. The surge in investment-grade
debt issuance seen in March continued throughout the second quarter, and as high-yield markets reopened, US
issuance volumes increased by 90% compared to the first quarter. In ECM, as markets rebounded to pre-COVID

levels, May and June together were our two busiest months for equity issuance ever, driven by converts and
follow-ons.
Moving to consumer spending behavior on the bottom left. Debit and credit sales volume, while overall still down,
has consistently trended upwards since the trough in the second week of April to down just 4% year-on-year in
the last two weeks of June. T&E and Restaurant spend continued to be down meaningfully, but we have seen
some improvement, especially on the back of higher levels of restaurant spend. The most significant improvement
we saw was in retail, with a strong recovery in card present volume in the second half of the quarter and
consistently strong growth in card not present volume throughout the quarter.
More recently, we've seen the improvement in overall sales growth across the country flatten out, notably, in both
states with increasing cases and states with decreasing cases. We continue to see larger year-on-year declines in
states that remain partially closed, particularly those in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.
In terms of consumers' demand for credit, we observed similar recovery trends. In Auto, April saw the lowest level
of loan and lease originations since the financial crisis, but activity rebounded sharply in May and June. And in
fact, June ended up the best month for auto originations in our history. And in Home Lending, retail purchase
applications, after reaching a low in April, recovered to well above pre-COVID levels in June, due to a strong and
broad market recovery.
Continuing on the topic of consumer behavior let's turn to page 3 for an update on what we're seeing around our
customer assistance programs. Relative to the peak-levels we observed at the beginning of April, we've seen a
significant decline in new requests for assistance over the quarter. To date, we have provided customer
assistance for nearly 1.7 million accounts, representing $79 billion of balances across both our owned and
serviced portfolios; and, of those accounts, a large percentage having made at least one payment while in the
forbearance period, just over 50% in both Card and Home Lending.
In terms of early reenrollment trends, in Card only a small portion of our customers have completed both the initial
90-day deferral period and reached a payment date, but the majority of those customers resumed payments, with
less than 20% of accounts requesting additional assistance. And then in Home Lending, of those whose
forbearance period expired in June, most have either been extended at the customer's request or auto-enrolled
into new three-month forbearances, with approximately 40% of the extensions still current. And so while we're
following this data closely, it's still too early to draw any conclusions.
Now moving on to page 4 for some more detail about our second quarter results. We recorded revenue of $33.8
billion, which was up $4.3 billion or 15% year-on-year. While net interest income was down approximately $600
million or 4% on lower rates, mostly offset by higher Markets NII and balance sheet growth, non-interest revenue
was up $4.9 billion or 33%, predominantly driven by CIB Markets and IB fees.
Expenses of $16.9 billion were up approximately $700 million, or 4%, year-on-year on revenue-related expenses,
partially offset by continued reduction in structural expenses. This quarter, credit costs were $10.5 billion,
including a net reserve build of $8.9 billion and net charge-offs of $1.6 billion.
Let's turn to page 5 for more detail on the reserve builds. Our net reserve build of $8.9 billion for the quarter
consists of $4.6 billion in wholesale and $4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly Card. The reserve increase in the
first quarter was predicated on an acute but short-lived downturn with a solid recovery in the second half of the
year. And while we have seen some positive momentum in the economy over recent weeks, there does continue
to be significant uncertainty around the path of the recovery.

At the bottom of the page you can see our updated base case. But remember, this is just one of five scenarios we
use to derive our allowance for credit losses. Our build is based on the weighted outcome of these scenarios and
assumes a more protracted downturn with a slower GDP recovery and an unemployment rate that remains in the
double digits through the first half of 2021.
In addition to the obvious impact on consumer, this protracted downturn is expected to have a much more broad-
based impact across wholesale sectors than we assumed in the first quarter. Given the increased uncertainty of
the macroeconomic outlook, how customer payment behavior will play out, and the future of government stimulus
and its ultimate effectiveness as it relates to both consumers and wholesale clients, we've put more meaningful
weight on the downside scenarios this quarter. And so, therefore, we're prepared and have reserved for
something worse than the base case. And given CECL covers life of loans, if our assumptions are realized, we
wouldn't expect meaningful additional reserve builds going forward.
Now moving to balance sheet and capital on page 6. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.4%, which is
over 100 basis points above our new SCB base minimum of 11.3%. And just to touch on SLR, while our reported
ratio is 6.8%, it's worth noting that we're not going to rely on temporary relief, and so without that, our ratio is
5.7%.
As we said in late June, unless things change meaningfully, the board intends to maintain the $0.90 dividend in
the third quarter. Given the wide range of potential outcomes going forward, I'd like to spend a few minutes on
why we're comfortable saying that, including the value of our strong and steady earnings stream as well as how
we are managing our capital through this crisis. So, with that, let's go to page 7.
It's an obvious point but it's worth a reminder that, since 2018, our average quarterly PPNR of over $13 billion has
been generating over 60 basis points of new CET1 capacity per quarter, even after having made meaningful
investments in our businesses. This powerful earnings stream allows us to grow the franchise and serve our
customers and clients when they need us most. And it provides us the capacity to absorb losses and quickly
replenish capital in times of stress.
While over the last two and a half years we've paid out approximately 100% of cumulative earnings, distributing
nearly $75 billion of excess capital, we're now building a significant amount of capital since we've suspended our
share repurchases. And we believe our capital base remains strong even in more severe scenarios, which you
can see on page 8.
Standing here today, we have $34 billion of reserves and $191 billion of CET1 capital, of which $16 billion is
excess over and above our regulatory buffers. Our 3.3% SCB translates to $51 billion of capital that is available to
pre-fund stress at any time. And on top of that, our 3.5% GSIB surcharge translates to another $54 billion. All that
so our $69 billion regulatory minimum is never touched.
And as you know, we prepare for and manage our capital to a number of scenarios, and one of them is the
extremely adverse scenario that Jamie discussed in his shareholder letter earlier this year. We've updated this
analysis and it now assumes an even deeper contraction of GDP, down nearly 14% at the end of 2020 versus 4Q
2019, and reported unemployment ending the year at nearly 22%. Even under this scenario, we estimate that we
would end the year with a CET1 ratio above 10%, and we would be bound by advanced, so our regulatory
minimum would be 10.5%.

While we are not likely to voluntarily dip into any of our regulatory buffers, this scenario would require us to do so
but, notably, only to a small extent. It's also worth noting that, based on the limited information provided from the
Fed about their U and W scenarios, we believe that our extremely adverse scenario simulates an even worse
path for the economy over the next 12 months. And even if we get this wrong and our losses are twice as high,
we still wouldn't use the entire SCB.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Okay. Yeah, this is Jamie. I'd just like to amplify a couple of these points. So we're showing this example.
Obviously, it's predicating a lot of assumptions, which we're not going to give you a lot of detail on, just simply to
show that we can bear another $20 billion of loan loss reserves. That $20 billion brings us to an extreme adverse
which roughly may equate to the U or W of the Fed, and we're going to do a lot more analysis on that because,
obviously, we need to be prepared for that.
We dip into advanced CET1 that's because we're taking no actions. So I've always told you that advanced capital
is very procyclical. So, as things get downgraded, your RWA goes way up. Your capital base doesn't change that
much but the RWA goes way up, and there'd be lots of actions we would take that we can avoid that from taking
place whatsoever.
The other thing I want to point out is this extreme adverse probably can't happen in one quarter. It'll happen in
several quarters because we already know kind of what July looks like and August and stuff like that. So, even if
the economy starts to head there, it'll take us a couple quarters before you make the determination that that has
100% possibility. Because, remember, this is saying we now believe it's 100%. And of course, things can be
worse, by the way, but we're just trying to show you how much capital the company does have.
And the dividend – now, I'm going to be – it sounds like I'm going to contradict myself; I am not, okay? Today, we
have all that PPNR, all that earnings, all the things, so it would kind of be foolish to guess the future of extreme
adverse and cut your dividend, because we can easily get through very, very tough times and never cut the
dividend. However, if you enter something like the extreme adverse, all of a sudden you have new scenarios
which are even worse. You don't know.
So, at one point, the board would consider cutting the dividend because things could get even worse in extreme
adverse, and we want to be able to handle anything out there. The primary concern of the company is to serve
our clients, serve our community through thick or thin, and no one should ever worry about JPMorgan Chase. So,
there's no intent to do it, but if things get really bad, and we use the word materially and significantly, then that's
something we should look at.
The other thing, by the way, is these loan losses are our best estimate of loan losses and not the CCAR type of
stuff. You all are doing estimates that show DFAST and Fed adverse. We will not lose that kind of money on
credit, okay? And on the next page, Jenn's going to explain some stuff and I'll make a few slight additional
comments.
I also want you to – she said that we're not going to use temporary buffers. I think temporary is a funny thing if you
go into a crisis and you can use it for a while, but it disappears on March 1 or February 1. So, in my view, is we
shouldn't rely on anything like that.

Jennifer A. Piepszak

And I'll just add, Jamie, to the point on advanced RWA. If you look on the slide and you can see, we traveled from
13.1% to 10.4%. About half of that is just the RWA increasing and the other half is the losses increasing.
So, anyway, as Jamie said, moving on to page 9, all of this is against the backdrop of a capital framework that still
has opportunity for recalibration. So while we've talked about this for years, it has perhaps never been more
important. I'll start with CCAR, and Jamie just made this point, but it is not predictive of what we actually think
would happen. And the best example of this might be the global market shock. It is a significant portion of the
SCB, and we've obviously experienced a very different result here in the first half of 2020.
So we continue to believe that there are opportunities to rationalize the overall capital framework, including the
points we've repeatedly made about GSIB. These changes would foster a higher pace of economic growth over
time without compromising financial stability.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. So, again, I just want to emphasize a couple things here. So, look, the point of CCAR was that banks
couldn't handle extreme stress and if everything goes wrong. CCAR itself is not a predictive forecast of what your
results might be. So, all the CCAR tests roughly equate to a global financial crisis and all the CCAR tests always
have us losing somewhere between $25 billion and $30 billion over the ensuing nine quarters.
But, in the ensuing nine quarters after Lehman, we made $30 billion. We never lost money in a quarter. We take
action. We're diversified. We got a lot of streams of earnings. And so we're not against CCAR because that's
protecting you from the worst of the worst of the worst, but that's not necessarily predictive.
The global market shock, which I think they have as $25 billion in counterparty losses. Again, just to be instructive
of that, in 2008 and 2009, you had Fannie Mae go bankrupt, Freddie Mac go bankrupt. You had Bear Stearns
effectively, you had Lehman Brothers effectively, you had AIG effectively, you had tons of financial institutions in
Europe, tons of counterparty failures, and our trading results in the worst two quarters combined was a loss of $4
billion, not $25 billion.
And of course, it was quickly made back because, as we pointed out, when things get bad in trading, spreads gap
out and then, all of a sudden, you're making more money trading because you have recoveries in position. So the
stress capital buffer 3.3% is not indicative of what we would lose. And I hope, over time, we could drive that down
by taking real actions to a number closer to 2.5%.
GSIB itself, I've pointed out before, I'm not against the concept of big banks and more capital. But GSIB is – it's
not the same as CCAR. CCAR includes your diversification, your strength, your earnings, your PPNR and things
like that, GSIB does not. It's just a measure of size multiplied over and over and over. It doesn't include
diversification. It doesn't include margin. It doesn't include actions. It doesn't include – it's just really not
representative at all what I would say is risk of a company or something like that. And so we have enough capital
to handle a lot of stuff, which is we've always run the company that way. We've always run the company so that
we can handle adverse times because in my short lifetime, I've seen crises over and over and over and over.
We're not predicting them; we're just prepared for them. So I'll stop there.

Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Okay. Thank you. All right, so let's go on to the businesses. So we'll start on page 10 with Consumer &
Community Banking. So CCB reported a net loss of $176 million including reserve builds of $4.6 billion. Revenue
of $12.2 billion was down 9% year-on-year driven by deposit margin compression, lower transaction activity and
customer relief, partially offset by strong deposit growth and Home Lending margin expansion.
The deposit margin was down 108 basis points year-on-year on a sharp decline in rates, but deposit growth was a
record 20% year-on-year, up over $130 billion. We would estimate that approximately 50% of that growth is
COVID-related due to government stimulus for consumers and small businesses, lower consumer spending and
tax payment delays. Mobile users were up 10% year-on-year. And since the start of the pandemic, we've seen
increased levels of digital engagement. For example, quick deposit enrollment is up two times pre-COVID levels.
As I noted earlier for consumer lending, the overall activity for the quarter reflected an environment that continued
to evolve. Auto loan and lease originations were down 9% year-on-year due to the exit of the Mazda partnership.
Excluding this impact, auto originations were up mid-single digits. And while the home lending market was
favorable, Home Lending total originations were down 1% year-on-year driven by a decline in correspondent
volume substantially offset by an increase in retail volume.
Total CCB loans were down 7% year-on-year driven by home lending down 14% due to prior loan sales and card
down 7% on lower spend offset by business banking up 59% due to PPP originations. Expenses of $6.6 billion
were down 3% driven by lower travel-related benefits, structural and marketing expenses. And lastly, credit costs
included the $4.6 billion reserve build I mentioned earlier and net charge-offs of $1.3 billion driven by Card.
Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Banking on page 11. CIB reported net income of $5.5 billion and an
ROE of 27% on revenue of $16.4 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $3.4 billion was up 91% year-on-year
largely driven by our strong performance in capital markets as well as the gains on our bridge book which were
primarily a function of improved market conditions. IB fees for the quarter were an all-time record, up 54% year-
on-year. We maintained our number one rank and grew our market share to 9.8% for the first half of the year.
In Advisory, we were up 15% driven by the closing of a few notable transactions. Debt Underwriting fees were up
55% and maintained our number one rank in overall wallet and were the leaders in lead-left across leveraged
finance. In Equity Underwriting, fees were up 93% and we grew share by approximately 200 basis points relative
to the first quarter.
With regards to outlook, we expect third quarter IB fees to be down both sequentially and year-on-year due to the
usual seasonal declines and lower M&A announcements year-to-date. And if the economy begins to stabilize, we
expect capital markets to revert to normal levels. However, any sustained period of instability could result in
additional demand for liquidity and therefore increased capital markets activity.
Moving to Markets, total revenue was $9.7 billion, up 79% year-on-year, an all-time record driven by strong
performance throughout the quarter, and it was only later in June that activity began to revert to more normal
levels. We saw strength across products and regions from both slow trading and large episodic transactions.
While strong client activity was a continuation of the first quarter theme, our market-making activity this quarter
benefited from improved market liquidity and we were able to better monetize flows.
Fixed Income was up 99% year-on-year or 120% adjusted for the gain from the IPO of Tradeweb last year driven
by very active primary and secondary markets across products particularly in macro. Equities was up 38% largely
8

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
driven by strong client activity in Equity Derivatives and Cash. Looking forward, we expect the slowdown that we
started to see towards the end of June to continue. In addition, the second half of last year was very strong,
making any year-on-year comparison difficult. But obviously the environment makes forecasting markets
performance even more challenging than usual.
Wholesale Payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 3% year-on-year primarily driven by our reporting
reclassification in Merchant Services. Security Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 5% year-on-year as
continued elevated volatility in the second quarter drove increased transaction volumes and higher average
deposit balances. Credit Adjustments and Other was a gain of $510 million as I mentioned upfront driven by the
tightening of funding spreads on derivatives and was a partial reversal of the losses in the first quarter. Expenses
of $6.8 billion were up 19% compared to the prior year due to revenue-related expenses. Finally, credit costs of
$2 billion reflect the net reserve build I referred to earlier.
So now moving on to Commercial Banking on page 12. Commercial Banking reported a net loss of $691 million
which included reserve builds of approximately $2.4 billion. Revenue of $2.4 billion was up 5% year-on-year
driven by higher deposits and loans, an equity investment gain and higher Investment Banking revenue largely
offset by lower deposit NII. Record gross Investment Banking revenues of $851 million were up 44% year-on-year
due to increased bond and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of $899 million were down 3% year-on-year
driven by lower structural expenses. Deposits of $237 billion were up 41% year-on-year as the increase in
balances from March have largely remained on our balance sheet as clients look to remain liquid in this
environment. End-of-period loans were up 7% year-on-year but down 4% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were
down 7% quarter-on-quarter as revolver utilization, while still elevated, has declined significantly from the all-time
highs in March. However, this was partially offset by the impact of PPP loans. CRE loans were flat with generally
lower originations in both Commercial Term Lending and Real Estate Banking. Credit costs of $2.4 billion
included the reserve build mentioned earlier and $79 million of net charge-offs, roughly half of which were in oil
and gas.
Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on page 13. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $658
million with pre-tax margin and ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was up 1% year-on-year as
growth in average deposit and loan balances along with higher brokerage activity were largely offset by deposit
margin compression. Expenses of $2.5 billion were down 3% year-on-year with lower structural as well as volume
and revenue-related expenses partially offset by continued investments in advisors. Credit costs were $223
million driven by the reserve builds that I mentioned earlier. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $29 billion,
positive across all channels and all regions led by Fixed Income and Equity. At the same time, we saw net
liquidity inflows of $95 billion, making us the number one institutional money manager globally. AUM of $2.5
trillion and overall client assets of $3.4 trillion, up 15% and 12% year-on-year respectively, were driven by
cumulative net inflows into liquidity and long-term products. And finally, deposits were up 20% year-on-year on
growth in interest-bearing products, and loans were up 12% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage
lending.
Now on to Corporate on page 14. Corporate reported a net loss of $568 million. Revenue was a loss of $754
million, down $1.1 billion year-on-year driven by lower net interest income on lower rates, including the impact of
faster prepays on mortgage securities. And expenses of $147 million were down $85 million year-on-year.
Now let's turn to page 15 for the outlook. You'll see here that despite the uncertain environment, our latest full
year outlook remains largely in line with our previous guidance. Based on the latest implieds, we expect net
interest income to be approximately $56 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $65 billion which is

slightly higher than expected previously, reflecting the outperformance in the second quarter and will ultimately be
an outcome of our performance in the second half of the year.
So to wrap up, against the backdrop of an unprecedented environment, our second quarter performance
highlighted the benefit of our diversification and scale and the resulting earnings power of our company. While the
range of outcomes is broader than ever before, our priorities remain unchanged. We are focused on supporting
our employees, customers, clients and communities around the globe and on being good stewards of the capital
entrusted to us by our shareholders. I'd like to end by thanking all of those who continue to serve on the frontlines
of this crisis and our people here at JPMorgan Chase who have demonstrated unwavering fortitude and
dedication through these times.
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John McDonald of Autonomous.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning, Jenn and Jamie. Jenn, was wondering if you could give us some incremental color on your
commercial exposures to heavily COVID-impacted sectors across CRE and C&I, so thinking oil and gas, travel
and retail just to help us understand the types of areas where your incremental commercial reserve building was
directed towards this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Sure. So I'll start by saying the most impacted sectors like the ones that you mentioned represents about a third of
our overall exposure. More than half of that is investment grade and two-thirds of the non-investment grade is
secured. And in terms of the second quarter downgrades, well, first, I'd say in the first quarter when we were
really looking at a deep but short-lived downturn, we were really very much focused on the most impacted
sectors. And now that we're looking at a more protracted downturn, we're reserved for a much more broad-based
impact across sectors. So just to put that in context, the second quarter reserve build, about 40% of that is in the
most impacted sectors versus two-thirds of the build in the first quarter was the most impacted sectors. And then
in terms of the downgrades that we saw in the second quarter, less than a third of those were in the most
impacted sectors.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
And just for your definition of most impacted sectors, what would you be including in that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Consumer and retail; oil and gas; real estate; retail and lodging, its sub sectors as you think about real estate.

John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And just a quick follow-up question. You maintain the NII outlook for the year despite a pretty big drop in
net interest margin. Can you talk about the dynamics embedded in that second half outlook for NII and maybe
how trading NII might play into that thinking?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah, it's a great question and you're spot-on which is Markets helps NII, so the outperformance in Markets helps
NII but can be a headwind on NIM just given that the NIM is below the average. So yes, maintaining that outlook
did have something to do with the outperformance in Markets, you're right.

Operator: Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Jennifer, just to kick off on a question on page 3. You went through a lot of detail
around the forbearance that you've been giving and the percentage that has been paying you at least once during
the deferral period. Could you give us a sense on these different asset classes that you've outlined in your base
case? What are you assuming those delinquencies end up becoming?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
So I won't go into specific details but I'll just say a couple things which is it is still too early to really read a whole
lot into what we're seeing. The visibility here remains low I would say given the amount of support that is out
there. But you are right that we are considering these customers to be higher risk given that they are in
forbearance programs, so we did account for that as we thought about our reserves.

Yeah, okay. Because I'm thinking, all right, you've got the inverse of the right-hand column could be construed as
what should be expected to become delinquencies over time. And I'm wondering as a follow-up question, you
mention during the prepared remarks that if your assumptions are realized that you could be basically close to
fully reserved for this cycle. Maybe if you could give us a sense as to which assumptions you're talking about
because I know you're expecting an outcome that's worse than your base case? So I was just a little confused
about what I should assume your base case is and what assumptions you're pointing to that, if realized, you're
done on the reserving.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Sure. So first of all, there are a lot of assumptions given as I said the visibility is still quite low, so assumptions
around the economic outlook, and I'll come back to that, assumptions around consumer payment behavior and
then assumptions around stimulus. So going back to the economic outlook, we have five different scenarios. We
did lean in more heavily to the downside scenarios relative than to what we would have otherwise done. Even the
Fed has put equal weight on downside scenarios and their base case, so we certainly thought having a
conservative bias there was the prudent thing to do.

And so, as you look at that slide 5, that is just the base case, so you can see there exiting this year just under
11%. When you then look at the weighted outcome of unemployment across the five scenarios, we end up with
double-digit unemployment through the first half of 2021 versus what you see on page 5 there is just the base
case which shows some improvement relative to the fourth quarter, getting down to just under 8% by the end of
2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Betsy, I'll just clarify. The base case, if you took Morgan Stanley's estimates or Mike Feroli's of JPMorgan or the
Fed estimates for their base case, that is basically the base case. Embedded in that are all these assumptions
about stimulus and PPP and all these other things. And that is the base case and we're reserved more than that.
So, therefore, if the base case happens, we may be over-reserved. I hope the base case happens.

James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the consumer and delinquencies. Obviously, you had an
impact from deferral programs and delinquencies actually – 30-day delinquencies were actually down. Can you
talk to what you're seeing in the non-deferral programs? It doesn't seem like we're seeing much stress at all even
in the early-stage delinquencies. What would you attribute that to and what are you seeing in your non-deferral
programs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
I mean, simply, I would attribute it to the amount of support that is out there in the form of stimulus. And so, as I
said, the visibility on what we're dealing with is very, very low because we're not seeing right now what you would
typically expect to see given a recession. And so, the way we have to think about reserving is all about the
outlook because we're not actually seeing it today. And so Jamie has said this many times. May and June will
prove to be the easy months in terms of this recovery and, now, we're really hitting the moment of truth, I think, in
the months ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. Can I just amplify it? In a normal recession, unemployment goes up, delinquencies go up, charges go up,
home prices go down, none of that's true here.

Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Income goes down; savings go down. Savings are up, incomes are up, home prices are up. So, you will see the
effect of this recession; you're just not going to see it right away because of all the stimulus and the fact 60% to
70% of the unemployed are making more money than they were making when they were working. So it's just very
peculiar times and...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Yeah. No, that's fair. Maybe a follow-up on DFAST. Jamie, you made comments about the market shock. We kind
of went through a market shock and everyone's trading held up quite well. Do you see that changing the Fed's
view over time in terms of how they think about stress losses in the trading book or you don't think that's too
optimistic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
I don't expect any change. And like I said, they're not – what they're looking at is they're making sure a bank can
withstand the bad – as if they are the worst bank. They're not giving credit to banks for things have been good. So
I'm not against that concept. I just want to say if it goes really bad and you do everything totally wrong, what
happens to your trading for something like that? And they do the same assumptions like outflows. The outflows
they have on liquidity are worse than the outflows of the worst bank in the worst crisis, but they just want to make
sure that every bank can withstand that.

Operator: Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Thanks. Quick question on the balance sheet; I mean, obviously, there's tremendous balance sheet growth
as liquidity built up in the quarter. But how are we thinking about that on a go-forward basis? Is that expected to
roll off over the next couple quarters? Does that kind of persist and expected to stick around and you're just going
to be operating with a much larger balance sheet near term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
So, I'll start with deposits. I mean, in the first quarter, it was very much a wholesale story and we said we expect it
to normalize and we have seen that. We started to see that. So, looking ahead on wholesale, I think there are
puts and takes. We'll continue to see revolvers pay down; Securities Services will likely continue to normalize. I
think tailwinds for deposits, Fed balance sheet extension will be slower but will continue, and we do think we'll
continue to see organic growth. On the consumer side, probably down from here on tax payments as well as a
pick-up in consumer spending. But, in both cases, I think we'll continue to see very, very strong year-on-year
growth both for wholesale and consumer in the latter part of this year.
And then in terms of balance sheet management, we manage the balance sheet across multiple dimensions: NII,
liquidity, capital and interest rate risk. And so, we have had $400 billion of deposit growth since the end of last
year. And when you consider, as you note, that some of that growth is likely to be transitory and deployment
opportunities have been diminished given the rate environment, we have held a decent amount of that in cash.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
However, we did add about $88 billion in securities here in the second quarter. And on the deposit side, we've
been very disciplined on pay rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, because deposits have grown, we should expect more to migrate from deposits on the asset side into
securities or are you looking to fund loans on those?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
As the Fed grows the balance sheet, it's going to end up in deposits. And for the most part, a lot of deposits will
end up in securities because the loan growth, usually going into a recession, doesn't go up that much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. We should see – as consumer spending recovers, we should see some growth in Card which will help, but
we'll have PPP starting to pay down and, as Jamie said, loan growth but likely slower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
I'd actually just point out that if you look at the big numbers, we have over $1 trillion between cash held at the
central bank which is close to $400 billion, $500 billion; Treasuries which is close to several hundred billion, and
other very liquid assets, mostly good securities, that's $1 trillion. When people look at the safety and soundness of
an institution like this, that is a tremendous sum of money. Some is required. We are required to hold a lot of
liquidity, but some of it's just because we're investing considerably.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about the expected timing of starting to see some
charge-offs. Obviously, there's a lot of unknowns with the stimulus and the forbearance. But what are your
assumptions in terms of when charge-offs start going up, maybe where they peak and how long they stay at that
level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
It's really difficult to know. I mean, first, we have to start seeing delinquencies, and so later this year, but next year
will be much heavier on charge-offs as we think about realizing the assumptions that we've made in the reserve.
It's very – it's difficult to know. The good thing is CECL is life of loan, so we feel well-covered for the scenarios
that we're looking at.

And then remind us – you are seeing some creep in the non-performing assets. Obviously, it's off low levels but
they are starting to go up. And remind us why that's not starting to feed into net charge-offs or is this just a timing
issue and will in the next quarter or two.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. When you look at the non-accrual increase in wholesale, half of that is one client so it's really – I wouldn't
draw any conclusions from that. And as you say, it's creeping up off of very low levels. So again, we still aren't
seeing what you would expect to see in terms of recessionary indicators.

Operator: Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Just more on the reserve question. So if the Fed's base case is achieved, then you are over-reserved. If your
base case assumptions which are more...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
We hope, we hope, we hope.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

We hope we're over-reserved regardless.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And if your base case assumptions which are more conservative are realized, then, okay, you're done with the
reserve building, and if it's worse then you'll have to add more reserves.

But since the end of the quarter, we're seeing an increase in COVID cases in Florida, in Texas, in California and
elsewhere. And isn't there a link between an increase in COVID cases with deaths with economic activity? Or how
do you think about that? And I'm staring at slide 2 and I can't get my eyes off that debit and credit card sales

volume and it seems like it's flattening off here in June. So just since the end of the quarter, if you were to kind of
mark-to-market your thinking as of this second with what's happening, do you feel better, worse or the same
versus the end of the quarter as it relates to your assumptions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
We feel exactly the same today than we did at the end of the quarter that's the mark-to-market. And Mike, we're
very clear. We cannot forecast the future. We don't know. We're also very clear that, I know at least I think, you're
going to have a much murkier economic environment going forward than you had in May and June, and you have
to be prepared for that. You're going to have a lot of ins and outs. You have people that's scared about COVID.
They're going to be scared about the economy, small businesses, their companies, bankruptcies, emerging
markets. So it is just going to be murky which is why if you look at the base case, an adverse case, an extremely
adverse case, they're all possible and we're just guessing at the probabilities of those things; that's all what we're
doing.
We are prepared for the worst case. We simply don't know. I don't think anyone knows. The word unprecedented
is rarely used properly. This time, it's being used properly. It's unprecedented what's going on around the world,
and obviously COVID itself is a main attribute. So the Fed's W case, they made it very clear. Their W case is that
COVID comes back in a big way in the fall and you have to shut down the economy again, and obviously we got
to be prepared for that too. We don't know the probability of that. We simply don't know and, by the way, we're
wasting time guessing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
And I would just add, Mike, to clarify that we are reserved for something worse than the base case.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
And for all the reasons you said, they informed our decision to lean in a bit more on the downside scenarios. And
so while there is a bit of, we hope, a conservative bias here, this does represent our best estimate based upon
everything we know which does include the sort of slowdown that you referenced in terms of more recent activity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
All right. And my follow-up would be kind of the flip side. During this very difficult time, you've grown deposits over
the past year equal to the fifth largest bank. I mean, the deposit growth is kind of off the charts here. So you said
half of that is due to COVID, but is the other half due to share gains? So I guess there's several questions in that,
but how much of that is related to digital banking and how much of that do you expect to go away once this crisis
has passed?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
So I talked a little bit about kind of how we're thinking about deposits looking forward. Also, I'll just clarify, Mike,
when we said 50% COVID-related, that was on the consumer side. And so that, we do think some of that will
leave with tax payments and consumer spending coming back. And then in terms of how much of it is share
gains, it's difficult to know at this point. Historically, we have performed well in lower rate environments. And I
think you're right, I think it is because of our digital capabilities and our branch footprint and our people and all the
things that we offer that differentiate us in a time like this.

Operator: Our next question is from Erika Najarian from Bank of America.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Good morning. This first question is for Jamie. A lot of investor feedback has indicated that they are
encouraged by the fact that banks can remain profitable while absorbing pretty significant provisions which you've
proven today but are hesitant about bank stocks given the overhang of the DFAST resubmissions in the fourth
quarter and what that could imply for the dividend. And I know you alluded to this in your prepared remarks, but
I'm wondering under the scenario that you see playing out and relative to that 60 basis points of CET1 generation
per quarter, what is your view on dividend sustainability outside of that extreme adverse case?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
It's completely sustainable. And if we enter the extreme adverse case, the board should and will consider
reducing it. And like I pointed out, the extreme adverse case itself is completely sustainable with the dividend. The
reason they would consider reducing it is because once you enter like 14% or 15% unemployment, you don't
know the future. So now we have another extreme adverse case which is going to be 20% unemployment, and
therefore you would protect yourself from that and cutting your dividend is cheap equity. And so the goal is to
sustain the dividends. You can look at the numbers. It's completely miniscule relative quarter-by-quarter. So this
decision can be made as you enter these things and we're all hoping the base case happens soon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And just as a quick follow-up. We also got this question from investors. In the extreme adverse case, is there a
preference towards cutting the dividend or a temporary suspension or is there a difference between the two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
There's no difference between the two. You cut your dividend, you're going to hopefully put it back when the time
comes. And temporary suspension just sounds peculiar. It's a suspension and I've done that twice in my life. It's
the prudent thing to do if you might need that capital going forward because things are going to get that terrible or
something like that. Remember, the other thing – you can ask the other question if the base case happens, we're
going to end up with far too much capital generation and we'll start buying back stock again which I hope we can
do before it goes way up.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hello, there. Question for you. So we had this big market rebound in the overall markets and that's led to a lot of
revenue. But given this outlook and the uncertain path that we've been talking through this whole time, I'm curious
on ways you think about potentially de-risking on balance sheet. Now some of it is just this huge liquidity build-up
is a de-risked balance sheet; I get that. But are there proactive things you can do to reduce the high leverage
RWA in a more stressed environment? Have you been selling into this recovery is, I guess, my question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Do you want...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Well, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Well, I was just going to say I guess there's two components to it which is the investment securities portfolio and
then proactive things we could do on RWA if that answers your question, Glenn. I'll start with investment
securities. We are being cautious and we have opportunistically looked to reduce credit exposure there over the
second quarter. And then on RWA, we are – because we're preparing for a range of outcomes, we are spending a
lot of time thinking about if we needed to, what could we do? But it is sort of a last resort because we certainly
don't want to have any impact on clients and customers. And so we're ready, we're looking at it but we haven't
done anything I would say proactively at this point. We're very much focused on helping clients and customers get
through this crisis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
So let me answer, sorry. On the consumer side, we like other banks you've seen are kind of prudent and
tightening up with how you do credit. That's already happened and obviously you can do some more. But Jenn,
you had some great numbers about how good credit is. Like, I think the – give us the FICO numbers you gave me
the other day.

Well then how much better home lending is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
That – on the LTV?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A

The weighted average LTV?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah, LTV. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
I mean, it's really extraordinary, and I was in mortgage so I should've remembered but I did have to ask. And in
2010, our weighted average LTV on the portfolio in Home Lending was 90% and it's now 56%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Right. And you can assume it's better in credit cards, it's better in auto, we have less subprime; that's the
consumer side. On the lending on the business side, we've always been prudent. We're always very tight and
careful on stuff like that. Usually what happens in downturns like this, you get a little more serious about security
and the management team and responsiveness and raising capital, so a lot of these companies have been raising
a lot of capital.
On the investment side, and this is kind of a peculiarity of accounting again, we can actually make it more
conservative by putting securities into held-to-maturity which we've done very little of and I'm going to consider it. I
don't personally understand why that reduces risk but it does reduce your SCB, and maybe we'll do that over
time, but the securities portfolio is pretty prudent as they are. And then trading is every day. So trading is – just
think of trading as if Daniel and Troy Rohrbaugh and Jason Sippel and the whole team, they are every single day
managing those risks and those exposures and you could assume that they're managing it very, very well and
tightly today. And we certainly are not punting to the fences or anything like that. We're trying to be very cautious
and serve our clients. And so, yeah, you are more conservative. And reducing RWA, yes, if we wanted to we
could start doing that by all these various things.

Thanks. One quickie on the consumer side. I'm curious if you've had – we're now four months into the bulk of the
lockdown in the United States, and some of your branches have been either closed or drive-up only and we're
watching your deposits grow like a weed. So I'm curious if you've learned any lessons that might change your
thoughts on the branch network, on your organic growth efforts as we go forward and come out of this someday.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah, so first of all, the deposit numbers. Deposits went up because of PPP. Deposits went up because of the
payroll checks that people got. Deposits went up – the revolvers were taken down by $50 billion, something like
that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Something like that. Almost all that ended up in deposits. And of course, a lot of that's already reversed and stuff
like that. So you got to look at both sides of that. But you were going to say something, Jenn?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
I was just going to add on – I mean there's, of course we're learning a lot. I mean I mentioned the QuickDeposit
enrollment, but we haven't learned enough to make any changes to our strategy around branch expansion. In
fact, we just opened our hundredth branch in market expansion. So we're really excited about that. We think we'll
probably open another 75 this year. So we'll be nearly halfway to the 400 branches that we talked about in market
expansion. And so we'll see.
We do still have about 1,000 branches that are closed. And it's possible that we learned something that helps us
think about accelerating de-densification or consolidation, but it'll be at the margin and we're not going to make
any big changes quickly because we want to make sure that we have the benefit, over time, of watching our
customer behavior, so they can really be the ones that inform our strategy.

Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Well, CET1, the only – and I'm not even trying to call it relief – there's a phase-in on CECL.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Oh, yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
But it's over many years. And so I don't necessarily think about that as temporary like SLR. SLR, at this point, it is
temporary. It is due to expire in the first quarter of next year, which is why we're very focused on managing that
without the exclusions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
And they're both – we manage them both. I wouldn't say one is more than the other. We manage something like
20 different capital and liquidity ratios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles Peabody Q
President, Portales Partners, LLC
And Jamie, FSOC is meeting today behind closed doors. If I understand, there are two topics. One has to do with
mortgage – secondary mortgage market liquidity and the other was the COVID stress test overlay. Do you have
any thoughts or insights as to what they may be discussing on either of those?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
I don't. The COVID, that means you could be – well, you obviously have some insights that I don't have. The
COVID, obviously, we're going to run a new stress test. We're going to run it – we're going to look at all the Fed
cases, U, W, and stuff like that because they laid it out. Perfectly reasonable that people would prepare for that
kind of stress test.
I think the mortgage markets is a different issue, okay? And we've been very consistent that mortgages, believe it
or not, are far more costly than they should be. Normally, you'd be looking at – if you looked at the 10-year rate,
which is, what, 60 basis points, the mortgage today should be 1.6% or 1.8% instead they are 3.3%. The cost –
and the reason for that is because the cost of servicing an origination is so high it's obviously got to be passed
through. It's high because an enormous amount of rules and regulation are put in place that a lot do not create
safety and soundness. Safety and soundness is basically 80% LTV, verify people's incomes, make sure you're
doing the right kind of stuff.
And the second one is because there's barely no securitization market. The securitization market is important
because it reduces your risk-weighted asset and it puts more incentive for banks to put in their balance sheet.
And the securitization market is a real transfer of risk to somebody else. So I think they should change that, they
should change it immediately. The beneficiary of that will be non-agency mortgages which are even more – a lot
more expensive than agency mortgages.

So, once you have a securitization market that people believe in and you have to change Reg AB a little bit to that
and all those things, you're going to have a much better market. The cost of mortgages will come down, and
they'll particularly come down for people at the lower end. So, this should be phased and it should be phased right
away.

Operator: Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking my question. I have a broader question. And I just want to get your perspectives on public policy
and banks and a little bit more broadly than the discussion about capital planning and stress tests. And I know
banks are working hard to be part of the solution this time and not part of the problem. But we're also having more
open discussions about things like inequality and social justice which, in my opinion, are long overdue, but I worry
that fair or not, banks are sort of being depicted as being on the wrong side of some of those issues. And I think
you see that in things like the mainstream press' depictions of big banks and PPP and stuff like that.
And I'm just curious if you are concerned at all about populist anti-bank policies gaining traction, however you
want to define them, whether it's breaking up the banks, directed lending, rate caps or whatever in a pretty
polarized political environment or do you think I'm being too alarmist or overly concerned about stuff that is pretty
unlikely in our country. So just kind of want to get your perspective just generally on how banks fit into the overall
policy and political backdrop.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Let me get this. The thing you got to do every single day when you go to work is just do the right thing for the right
reasons, serve your customers and we try to do that. We try very hard to take care of our employees, to train
people. We try very hard to advance black leaders in the company, finance others, and of course we make
mistakes. And so I understand some of the angst out there, but we try to do the best we can. We get involved in
policy like this mortgage thing. That would be better for Americans. And we understand that people want banks to
help America; we do. The most important thing we can do is be a healthy, vibrant bank through this crisis and
continue to serve our clients.
And remember, responsible lending is good lending. Irresponsible lending is bad lending. So, very often, when
you hear that banks should do more of that. No, irresponsible stuff is irresponsible. It will lead to bad outcomes.
And that's kind of what happened last time around. So we try to do it right and we try to listen very carefully when
there's criticism and sometimes – and often legitimate, about what we could have done better or should do better
or try to do better in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. I guess, as broad as that question was, I'm going to ask a very narrow question for Jenn on
your NII guidance. I presume that includes gains on PPP fees for unforgiven loans. And have you quantified that
or sized that up in terms of where you think the magnitude of those figures could be?

So we've been really clear on PPP, which is that we don't intend to profit from PPP. That doesn't mean that you
won't have some geography issues. So you'll have some revenue and then you'll have expenses, and the profit
will be near zero. It is an immaterial amount this quarter given these fees are recognized over the lives of the
loans. So, it's very little this quarter, both revenue and expenses. And looking out, you'll see – we'll see more of
that probably in the third and fourth quarter. Again, it will still be zero on the bottom line, and even the gross
numbers won't be meaningful in the grand scheme of things.

Operator: Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Jenn. Can you share with us the reclassification of the wholesale portfolio that you
talked about? How often do you go through that process where you have to look to reclassify the corporate loans?
And second, you touched on earlier in a question about some of the COVID-related sectors that are being
impacted because of what we're going through. Can you highlight for us what is the most stressed within that
COVID group that you mentioned?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
So, first on the reclassification, we mentioned it was a geography issue in merchant services. It didn't have to...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
There was no reclassification of wholesale loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. Yeah. And then, in terms of the most impacted, they are the ones that you would expect to see around
travel, oil and gas and real estate and retail. So it's the sectors that you would expect to see. Although, as I said
earlier, and it's important to note, that for the downgrades that we experienced in the second quarter, less than a
third of them were in the most impacted industries. So, really, this is – we're seeing this as being much more
broad-based.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thank you. And then second, I may have missed this, I apologize. But in your slide 3 you give us very good
detail on the forbearance on the consumer portfolio. Do you have any numbers on the commercial and corporate
portfolios that – loans that might be in forbearance? And is it more commercial real estate or C&I?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
They're just not meaningful numbers. We would have included them had they been. So I'll just go back to what we
said which is we're just not seeing what you would typically see.

Operator: And our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on the points and slides you made about capital and long-term
opportunities for recalibration. First, I guess, will you have any dialogue with the Fed about the 3.3% SCB as
some other banks have mentioned? And then secondly, where do you think we stand on the GSIB recalibration to
your points about systemic risks that shouldn't impact a bank's balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
We're not going to just go back to the Fed on the 3.3%. But, obviously, we're looking at why 3.3% and we can try
to adjust our plans going forward to try to reduce that number a little bit because we know we have another CCAR
coming up in a couple months, so there's no reason for us to go through extensive amounts of work as opposed
to fix what's already there.
And GSIB, look, I've always thought GSIB needed a lot of recalibration. But there are things they should have
recalibrated for already, because America has gold-plated it, which I think was wholly unnecessary. They should
have taken cash and treasuries and a whole bunch of stuff out of the calculation. And, obviously, it goes way up
when the Fed does things like they're doing recently. And they never adjusted it for growth in the economy or
growth in the shadow banking system, which they were supposed to do.
So I'm just hoping they go about and do that at one point. But these things get so wrapped up in political – people
politicize very complicated calculations, which I find kind of peculiar and funny. But my view is if they do the
numbers, they should do them right. And they're just not right anymore.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yes. And the second question is just going back to slide 3. You lay out the percent of accounts on this page. Auto
seems to be the biggest. And then in the supplement on page 13, the balances seem to imply a bigger percent on
deferral. Just can you talk a little bit about the differences there, and then why do you think you're seeing more
accounts in auto deferring versus other asset classes? Thank you.

with you on that one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q

Okay, maybe then just a comment about auto on deferrals. And what do you think you're seeing in that customer
base versus others? And do you think that means anything different for forward credit trends?

Operator: Our next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Hi. Yeah, good morning. Thank you. I guess I just think it was such an extraordinary quarter for capital raising.
Dealogic shows over $2 trillion of debt and equity raised in the quarter. And I guess a two-part question around
that. One is, as you look at that, was a good portion of that in kind of the stressed areas, and presumably capital
that is junior to your bank debt? And to what extent has all that helped raise the quality of bank loans?
And then secondly, looking forward, did all the companies that needed to and could raise capital do so in the
second quarter? And, therefore, we're looking at kind of a flat spot going forward, or do you see this as kind of like
there's an ongoing need for a lot of these companies to continue to raise capital?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Well, I think – first of all, it was across the board. You saw strong companies, weaker companies, high yield
markets opened up. Converts, I'd put converts and equity in there too. People did a lot of capital raising. I think it
was wise. I think a lot of people said they pre-funded a lot of their capital needs to make sure they can get through
whatever this crisis means for their company and their industry and stuff like that.
So I don't think it would be like it was before, so it'll definitely come down. But I still think there's opportunity for
some people to pre-fund some of that. But it is pre-funding. This is not capital – a lot of this capital is not being
raised to go spend. It's being raised to sit in the balance sheet so that you're prepared for whatever comes next.
And you've heard a lot of companies make statements. And you guys got to go through it yourself about, you
know, we've got two years of cash, we've got three years of cash, we've got – people want to be prepared, and I
think it's appropriate.

Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
But just for your models, we don't expect revenues in investment banking. They'll normalize or even come down
below normal next quarter and the quarters out at one point and we can't predict month by month exactly. And for
trading, because no one asked, cut it in half. Cut it in half and that'll probably be closer to the future than if you
say it's going to still be double what it normally runs.

[indiscernible] (01:08:26) last question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Lim Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I think they're quite straightforward. I just want some clarity
really on the nature of CECL provisioning. And, obviously, you've made some very big provisions based on much
more conservative assumptions, but the nature of CECL provision obviously could mean that in the third quarter,
if your assumptions do not change, then your provisions should fall down quite considerably versus the second
quarter to a much more normal level. I just wanted to see how you thought about that for the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Sure. So I would start by saying where we are right now – while there is a conservative bias to where we are right
now, it is our best estimate of what we're facing. We certainly hope that in the future we look back on this as a
conservative moment. But this is our best estimate and so if our assumptions are realized, and again, our reserve
reflects something worse than the base case, so if that's realized then we shouldn't see meaningful reserve builds
in the third quarter, or if that continues to be our...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Lim Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A

...third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Lim Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Yeah. So I mean, context, would it be similar to quarters that we've seen in 2019, for example?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Lim Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Exactly. Exactly. That's very clear. Thanks for that. And then on the CIB trading environment, obviously, we saw
June and we've seen better in July. Would you say that's normalized to a level consistent with what we've seen
with 2019, or are you still seeing some pretty strong trading following through into the third quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
I just answered that question. You should assume it's going to fall in half. We don't know, it's only been a couple
weeks into the thing. But we don't assume we're going to have these unbelievable trading results going forward.
And hopefully we'll do better than that, but we simply don't know. I also just want to point out in reserving, since
it's probabilistic, you could actually change nothing in your assumptions, but the probabilities of potential
outcomes we'd put up more reserves.
