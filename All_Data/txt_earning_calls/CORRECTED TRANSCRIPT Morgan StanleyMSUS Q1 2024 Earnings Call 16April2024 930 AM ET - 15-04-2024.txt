Chief Executive Officer & Director, Morgan Stanley
Good morning and Happy Spring in New York. Thank you for joining us. We enter 2024 with optimism,
encouraged by improving boardroom confidence and an increasingly positive tone from our Institutional and
Wealth Management clients. The quarter was strong; we generated $15 billion of revenue, a 71% efficiency ratio,
$2.02 in earnings per share, and a 20% return on tangible equity. In a relatively constructive environment, these
results highlight the power of our clear and consistent strategy, serving as trusted advisor to our clients, helping
them raise, allocate, and manage capital. During the quarter, higher asset prices and an improved economic
backdrop supported confidence with our Wealth Management client base. We saw greater activity both in the

advisor-based and self-directed channels, resulting in higher adjusted margins of 27%. Net-new assets grew by
$95 billion. Investment Management also generated positive long-term flows in the quarter.
Across both Wealth and Investment Management, total client assets grew to $7 trillion, advancing toward our $10
trillion goal. As the new issue calendar returned for the first time in a number of quarters, it was great to see us
regain our leadership position in equity capital markets. More broadly, we saw building momentum in Investment
Banking, both in our M&A and underwriting pipelines across corporate and financial sponsor clients.
[Technical Difficulty] (00:02:53) both generated very solid results, to round out a strong quarter in Institutional
Securities. As ever, we remain focused on managing our resources, sweating the income statement, and being
judicious with our capital. Our CET1 ratio was 15.1%. Our excess capital position allows us to support our clients,
invest in our businesses, and return capital to our shareholders, particularly as regulators continue to evaluate
Basel III end game.
Additional regulatory clarity and a sustained capital markets recovery should have a multiplier effect across our
global franchise, further unlocking the unique power of our integrated firm. I want to touch on the topic of client
onboarding and monitoring in the wealth business with three short observations. First, this quarter's Wealth
Management results speak for themselves with record revenues and strong metrics across the board, including
strong margins and very strong net-new assets. We're really pleased with this terrific performance and we are
going to keep on going. Second, this is not a new matter. We've been focused on our client onboarding and
monitoring processes for a good while. We have ongoing communications with our regulators, as all the large
banks do. As James said in January, we want to ensure we continue to be world-class in every aspect of this
growing business. And third, to be clear, this is about processes.
We have been spending time, effort, and money for multiple years and it is ongoing. We've been on it and the
costs associated with this are largely in the expense run rate. To conclude, the first quarter of 2024 aligns with the
goals outlined in the January strategy deck. $15 billion of revenue, a 71% efficiency ratio, $2 of earnings, $7
trillion of client assets, and a 20% return on tangible. We have strong backlogs and momentum in every part of
the firm. While the pipelines are healthy, there remains a backdrop of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Our
job is to generate these kinds of durable results on a consistent basis. I'm very optimistic what lies ahead for
Morgan Stanley. And on behalf of our 2,300 managing directors and 80,000 employees, same to those listening
to the call, we will deliver an integrated firm to clients and shareholders that is unmatched in both its integrity and
its intensity.
Now I'll turn it over to our excellent CFO, Sharon Yeshaya, to discuss the quarter in more detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Thank you and good morning. In the first quarter, the firm produced revenues of $15.1 billion, our EPS was $2.02,
and our ROTCE was 19.7%. Our model is working as intended. The first quarter results demonstrate the strength
of our scaled business and an improving backdrop. Benefits of durable revenues, particularly asset management
fees in the Wealth Management business, stronger capital markets and a continued focus on managing the full
income statement all contributed to results. The firm's first quarter efficiency ratio was 71%, illustrating the
inherent operating leverage in the model and our ongoing efforts to consolidate our expense base following
multiple years of integrations. Efforts are evidenced by the year-over-year reduction in professional services and
marketing and business development spend.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2024
Lower legal expenses further supported the improvement in efficiency ratio. Now to the businesses. Institutional
Securities revenues of $7 billion were up 3% versus the prior year, reflecting strong performance across
businesses. First quarter revenues underscore the power of the integrated firm as our cross-divisional
collaboration positioned us to capitalize on market opportunities. The geographical breadth continues to
distinguish our franchise and puts us at the center of client activity as the backdrop improves across regions.
Investment Banking revenues were $1.4 billion for the first quarter, up 16% from the prior year. A pickup in both
equity and fixed income underwriting supported results, offsetting the year-over-year decline in advisory. Leading
indicators continue to progress positively, including the preliminary re-emergence of sponsor activity.
Advisory revenues of $461 million reflected a decline in completed M&A transactions. Equity underwriting
revenues of $430 million more than doubled versus the prior year as IPO markets reopened for most of the
quarter alongside conducive markets for follow-ons. Our global reach supported our ability to lead cross-border
transactions and we regained our premier leadership position in equity underwriting league tables as global
market volumes picked up.
Fixed income underwriting increased year-over-year to $556 million. Results were driven by strengths in
investment grade and non-investment grade bond issuance as clients took advantage of tighter credit spreads.
Looking ahead, we expect the steady build of this business to continue. We are encouraged by the health of the
advisory and underwriting pipelines.
While the uncertainty of the rate path and geopolitical developments may impact the near-term conversion of
pipeline to realized, conditions should improve over time and the underlying trends suggest that confidence is
increasing. We remain focused on expanding our reach through opportunistic hires, particularly as we continue to
see diverse pipeline and increased sponsor activity.
Turning to equity. We continue to be a global leader in this business. Revenues were strong, increasing 4% from
the prior year to $2.8 billion. Results were supported by performance in derivatives and cash and the franchise
benefited from the scale of our Prime Brokerage business. Cash revenues increased year-over-year, reflecting
broad-based strength in equity markets across the regions. Performance in Japan was particularly strong,
supported by higher volumes.
Our increased coverage augmented by our longstanding and unique partnership with MUFG should be supportive
over time. Derivative revenues were robust as the business navigated the market environment well and client
activity was strong.
Prime Brokerage revenues were solid as client balances increased back towards all-time highs on higher market
levels. Results reflect the mix of client balances and narrower spreads. Fixed income revenues were $2.5 billion.
Results declined slightly compared to the strong result last year.
Recall, last year's results benefited from increased client engagement on the back of idiosyncratic events,
including those related to the US regional banks. Client demand for corporate solutions acted as a partial offset,
reflecting the strength of our integrated franchise.
Macro and micro revenues declined modestly year-over-year on lower volatility and client activity, which resulted
in less transactional flow. Results in commodities increased year-over-year, supported by higher revenues in the
North America power and gas business.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2024
Turning to Wealth Management. The business delivered strong results across all key metrics, demonstrating the
continued power and differentiation of the engine we have built. Record revenues increased from the prior year to
$6.9 billion, driven by record asset management fees from both a rising market and ongoing success in migrating
clients to advisory relationships to better serve their needs. Transactional revenues, excluding DCP, were also
strong as retail sentiment improved alongside institutional investors. Importantly, net interest income remained in
line sequentially.
Pre-tax profit was $1.8 billion and the PBT margin was 26.3%. Together, DCP and the FDIC special assessment
impacted the margin by approximately 115 basis points. The results highlight the inherent operating leverage
embedded in the business, particularly as revenues rise on the back of cumulative strong fee-based flows as
clients invest more in higher beta assets and transactional activity rebounds.
Net new assets for the quarter were strong at $95 billion with contributions from multiple channels, including our
family office offering. Over time, our ability to deliver unique solutions to clients should continue to attract assets
and lead to share capture.
Fee-based flows of $26 billion were strong. Within fee-based flows this quarter, we saw particular strength from
the migration of assets from the adviser-led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts. This demonstrates that
over time assets migrate through the funnel into recurring revenue-generating accounts.
Fee-based assets now stand at over $2 trillion. Asset management revenues were $3.8 billion, up 13% year-over-
year, primarily reflecting higher market levels and the cumulative impact of strong fee-based flows. Transactional
revenues were $1 billion and, excluding the impact of DCP, were up 9% versus the prior year. The first quarter's
results were driven by client engagement across products, including record activity in structured products.
Investments in our platform allow us to support increased client demand.
Bank lending balances were $147 billion, up slightly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting modest growth in mortgages.
Total deposits of $347 billion were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter as the decline in sweep balances was offset
by continued demand for our savings offering. While sweep balances were down on a spot-to-spot basis, average
sweeps were roughly in line with last quarter, broadly consistent with our modeled expectations. Net interest
income was $1.9 billion, flat to the fourth quarter's results, consistent with our guidance. The moderate increase in
average deposit cost was offset by several factors, including the reinvestments of assets at higher market rates.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of NII.
Assuming the current forward curve and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would
expect NII in the second quarter to again be roughly in line with the first quarter. Our strategy is working; we have
a clear path to $10 trillion in client assets across Wealth Management and Investment Management. We remain
focused on supporting clients on their path to advice, deepening existing client relationships and using our scaled
platform to achieve sustainable 30% pre-tax profits over time. Investment Management reported revenues of $1.4
billion, increasing 7% versus the prior year. Results reflect higher asset management revenues which increased
8% year-over-year driven by growth in average AUM on higher market levels.
Total AUM increased to $1.5 trillion. Long-term net flows were strong at $7.6 billion. Inflows were driven by
strength in alternatives and solutions and reflect the benefits of our diversified product offering. Within alternatives
and solutions, demand for Parametric customized portfolios was robust as retail clients, including our own Wealth
Management clients, allocated investments to Parametric's equity-based products, underscoring the value of the
integrated model. Flows were further supported by global interest in our active fixed income strategies. Liquidity

and overlay services had outflows of $12.9 billion. Performance-based income and other revenues were $31
million. Gains in US private equity and private credit offset lower accrued carried interest in Asia private equity
and real estate, demonstrating the benefits of a global diversified platform.
We are seeing the benefits of ongoing investments in this business. We remain focused on customization, private
credit, and our global distribution. Parametric in particular has allowed us to deliver the integrated firm evidenced
by the ongoing demand from our Wealth Management client base. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets
were $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.1%, down 14 basis points from the prior quarter.
Standardized RWAs increased quarter-over-quarter as we actively supported our clients in more constructive
markets. We continue to deliver our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, buying back $1 billion of
common stock during the quarter. Our tax rate was 21% for the quarter. The vast majority of share-based award
conversion takes place in the first quarter, resulting in a lower tax rate.
We continue to expect our 2024 tax rate to be approximately 23% which, similar to prior years, will exhibit some
quarter-to-quarter volatility. The first quarter is clear evidence that as the backdrop improves our franchise is
strategically positioned to capture upside, as it was designed to do. With client assets at a record of $7 trillion
across Wealth and Investment Management, we are on strong footing. Our Wealth Management business
continues to focus on growth as well as supporting our clients with advice and delivering our differentiated
offering, and our institutional franchise is supported by our scale and our global footprint. This combined with the
build of the Investment Banking pipelines and market confidence provides us with momentum to deliver on our
objectives over time.
With that, we will now open the line up to questions.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thank you. And I appreciate you not running away from a sensitive subject. I'm going to push the envelope
and just ask one follow-up, if possible, on the wealth matter. I wonder if you could size the non-US wealth piece,
whether it be in client assets or revenue for us, and correct me if I'm wrong if that's the focus. And then more
importantly, do you think – obviously, you had a pretty darn good quarter. So do you think this impacts any day-to-
day or your ability to grow and onboard clients in the future? That's my real main question. Thank you.

Sharon Yeshaya A

I think it's a great question, Glenn. Happy to take that and just follow-up on exactly what Ted said which is, as you
said, the results really speak for themselves. This is a phenomenal business. We had record revenues and we're
in a great position. We have strong margins, strong net-new assets. And no, there are no strategic changes to our
business. There is no changes in our ability to do business, and we're extremely confident in our ability to grow
and to deepen the relationship with the breadth of firm offerings that we have to serve our clients. Specific to your
question on the international business, it is small.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Maybe, Ted, for you, as we think about – so it was a strong quarter for Investment Banking
underwriting. There seems to be a fragility to the macro outlook based on how rates have behaved on the back of
inflation, geopolitics. Just give us a sentiment check of when you're talking to your corporate clients, like how
resilient do you see the Investment Banking sort of trends and the sort of desire and appetite for corporates to
engage in either DCM, ECM or M&A, large M&A activity as we look into sort of later in the year into the US
elections? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward N. Pick A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Morgan Stanley
Thanks for your question. The pipeline is clearly growing; it's growing across sectors, it's growing on a cross-
border basis. There are some who will be willing to take the regulatory risk at this point in the cycle, and there is
activity that we will see both from the financial sponsor community and the corporate community; we'll effectively
be bidding with and against each other for assets. This is a moment when most want to purify their business
model or grow, and that scaling needs to take place now that the effects of COVID and supply chain are in front of
us and geopolitics continue to be on our minds. It is not surprising that the C-suite wants to act, so I think we are
in the early innings of a multi-year M&A cycle. On the back of that, we should continue to see all kinds of
underwriting.
What was interesting about this ECM quarter where we had real success was that it was a combination of IPOs
from the Valley, capital raises from industrial companies, regional trades, cross-border unlocks. It was the whole
potpourri of offerings and we've also begun to see the beginning of event financing in the high-yield and leveraged
loan market, so I'm feeling good about this being early to mid-cycle for the classic investment banking and capital
markets business around the world. And as you know, we are very active in Japan where we think activity will be
heightened for years to come.

That's good color and just one quick follow-up. Sharon, on the Wealth Management NII and sweep deposits, I
think the sense is that we're getting to a bit of a bottom on NII. Is that an accurate characterization and should we
stop worrying about a big cliff event where NII declines meaningfully from where we've trended?

I would characterize it as it's now the third quarter in a row that I've said that our sweep models and the client
behavior is following client expectations. It does feel as though we are reaching that frictional level of cash. Of
course, we'll have to wait and see how things play out. But broadly speaking, it feels as though, like I said, we are
in a place where you have what we would say is intra-quarter volatility associated with things that might be T bills
maturing, people putting things in markets. But that, again, is frictional levels of cash rather than large changes or
movements in real client behavior which is what you saw two years ago in the summer when we saw the large
move in rates which was a one-off event.
And then you had, again, a very large event with the regional bank movements in the first quarter of last year, so
those are very specific events that we can look at. And since then, like I said, we have been working with our
modeled expectations.

Good morning, Ted. Good morning, Sharon. So, maybe just starting off on the expense outlook, we saw some
good progress on the expense front and the KPIs are encouraging. Headcount was down year-on-year, comp and
non-comp surprised positively in ISG and Wealth. And I was hoping you could just speak to your efforts to
rationalize or optimize the expense base. And with IB and wealth fees expected to ramp, consistent with the M&A
commentary, Ted, that you cited, how should we be thinking about incremental margins as these businesses and
particularly fees start to grow?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Certainly. Let's take just the expense big picture and we, obviously, disclosed the SEC drivers of expenses, I
called them out. We've had multiple years now where we've been looking to integrate multiple acquisitions. And
as we've come out of that, we've been able to re-evaluate our expense base. And I've talked about it in different
pieces of our earnings call.
Many times, I've mentioned space. You can see even in the lines around occupancy, in the actual disclosures,
you could see bump-ups in space where you're taking write-offs down in space and then it begins to trend down

again. So, we're making big-picture decisions around what do we actually need and where do we want to invest
growth drivers as we move forward.
So, consolidating the marketing dollars and figuring out what is the best use of those marketing dollars,
consolidating professional services, how do we actually want to deploy full-time hires in those growth objectives?
So, in my prepared remarks, we talked about two things. We talked about taking expenses down in certain line
items, but we also discussed investments, right? I talked about the fact that we're looking at opportunistic hires in
M&A. We've discussed a lot about investing in Parametric and technology. We've been giving technological tools
to our advisers and investing in the business. So, it's a push/pull and it's making sure, as Ted said, that we're
sweating the income statement and we're thinking about our resources efficiently and durably as we move
forward through the cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward N. Pick A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Morgan Stanley
What I'd add to that is if you just sort of had an intangible sense of what we talk about at our leadership meetings,
our operating committee of a dozen people and the next group, the management committee of about three dozen
and then their leadership teams, I think it's fair to say, Steve, over the last five years, a large chunk of time was
spent talking about capital efficiency, how we can optimize those toggles.
And of course with Basel III endgame pending and the annual CCAR process ongoing, we, of course, continue to
dedicate time to that. But the sea change over the last number of quarters, and it has accelerated now into 2024,
is we're actively talking about the income statement about delivering earnings growth, earnings momentum that
obviously then ties into the returns on capital that we were able to generate this quarter.
But we're looking to make investments, strategic investments in top human capital now and then when it comes
about, but we're being pretty judicious about that. This is a great platform and we have a great team, but we need
to be running this thing super-efficiently. And that is why reiterating the efficiency ratio of 70% in January was so
important and that we put up 71% this quarter where it was a generally constructive environment.
I think I called it a relatively constructive environment, but there's clearly more operating leverage to be had when
you get to the higher brackets of ISG and then as you move to the funnel well. So, the focus on generating that
operating leverage and keeping the income statement really tight is very much on the minds of the leadership
team.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's great color. And just for my follow-up relating to the Wealth Management margins, unpacking some of the
different component pieces given continued strong fee momentum, nice to see the inflection in NNA, too. It
sounds like NII is close to stabilizing just given some of the key drivers and inputs and the focus on efficiency.
Just throwing all of that in the blender does suggest that this 26% is probably a reasonable jumping off point and
you can build off that base, but I was hoping you could maybe provide some context around that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, what I would say is that we put out our goals in the last strategy deck and we're obviously making progress
towards those goals. And when you think about what gets you to 30%, the framework that we've offered the

investment community is that there is sort of three parts to it. The first is migration to advice and really the
monetization of the funnel will go through this. The second, when you think about it, is solutions and products that
we're offering. And then, the third is the benefits of scale. And what was encouraging about this quarter is that all
three of those things happened. The first being the fee-based flows that we saw at $26 billion came from
brokerage accounts.
They came from people taking money that was already in the channel that we've said will eventually be deployed
and it is being deployed and that's what you're seeing here. If you look back, that particular transition, that
conversion is at a two-year peak. Again, encouraging color, Steve.
The second piece, solutions, products, differentiated offering. I called out structured products. People have
interest in products, as Ted said, as markets begin to improve, those could be new issuance, that can be
derivatives, that can be solutions through structured notes. That's what we're seeing beginning to happen here so,
yes, again, an encouraging sign. And the third is that we continue to gain the benefits of scale and operating
leverage, so all three things are working. Of course, there's room to run.
But what we're trying to do is make sure that we also have the right trade-offs between investing in the business,
giving ourselves room for technology, and being able to build a 30% margin for a sustainable business and
durable revenues over time.

Excellent. I'd love to start with a question on NII. And I know I've asked this in the past, but we saw stability in the
Wealth Management NII which, Sharon, you've spoken at length about both on this call and in the past, but we did
see the firm-wide NII dip again and it was the fourth quarter where the firm-wide NII declined. So could you
explain how those diverged and maybe what caused some of that divergence?

Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. I think we talked about it before, Brennan, but I'm happy to talk about it again and highlight that the reason
that we point you to the Wealth Management NII is it's a business-driven NII. When we look at the trading NII and
we look at firm NII, it really depends on the products you have, where you're booking them, what you're using as
your funding source. That falls into the various pieces of the trading revenue, so we focus you in from our
disclosures really on the Wealth Management NII when that NII is being driven by a business concept rather than
just where you might be booking certain trading [ph] traits (00:34:24).

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
No. I would really step you back and tell you that that's not how we manage the business and the trading revenue
is going to fall where the trading revenue falls based on the products that we transact in in that quarter. And the
Wealth Management revenue, I've given you the drivers with the deposits, with interest rates, with spreads, and
with re-investment. And they're really two separate things that you should be looking at.

Operator: We'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.

Edward N. Pick A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Morgan Stanley
Good morning, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. You had big year-over-year growth in Wealth Management client assets, up by about 20%, but the Wealth
Management revenues increased by 5%. Still decent growth but it seems like a little disconnect there, so I'm
wondering what kind of Wealth Management client assets you're growing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Certainly. So when you're growing the Wealth Management client assets, it's going to be all sorts of places. Like I
said, we begin to see assets – they can come in actually in the brokerage side. And over time, they will migrate or
can migrate based on the client preferences into the advice side. Those different assets are going to have
different fees associated with them. For us, it's about growing the funnel, Mike, and then beginning to see this
movement towards advice. Now, I'd also point out that once you're in the advice-led channel, even if you're in the
fee-based channel, you might not directly be in the S&P; there's a composite. There might be preferences to be in
fixed income products, there might be preferences to be in equity products. But for us, it's about building
sustainable, durable revenue over time.
First, you bring in the clients and the participants; we've seen the participants grow. Then you bring in the assets;
we've seen the assets grow. That then comes into the brokerage accounts which eventually moves into the

advice-based accounts, and we continue to see great trends in the advice-driven model, in fee-based assets, and
the asset management revenues. The asset management revenues, Mike, are at a record high so I would just
highlight that as well as proof point that this model is working.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then just one follow-up for Ted. Ted, I think your outlook for the industry capital markets was about as bullish
as we've heard yet; I think you used the word potpourri. IPOs in the Valley, cross-border by sector, financial
sponsor, Japan highest in years, event financing. Specifically, what are your backlogs? How do they compare
with last quarter? And just one more time, the level of your conviction that this time it's for real because there's
been a lot of small starts the last two years? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward N. Pick A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Morgan Stanley
Yeah, I think it's a reasonable question. The backlogs are all up. I think it will be a slow march back. People are
not going to jump into some of the speculative paper that we saw during the SPAC period, clearly. But the
receptivity to recent IPOs that were high-quality was quite impressive, quite broad interest among investors. The
need to execute on cross-border M&A is here. It's, for many companies, an existential reality. Their supply chains
have been disrupted by two major global conflicts and they need to near-shore and make the trade-off, which
means they need to potentially bolt-on a piece of supply chain that's in front of them. They may need to take
regulatory risk, there may need to be structuring and financing advice around that, so-called solutions where we
think we're strong.
The other motivating piece, Mike, is – and I do think there's going to be growing consensus on this, the financial
sponsor community is sitting on a product that has a three, four, five-year life as a private company ready to come
out one way or the other, either through a public offering or to be sold in the private markets. That is the best way
for the financial sponsor community to return capital to their LPs and keep the thing going with raising ever-big
funds. So there will be a competitive dynamic, I believe, between the financial sponsor and corporate community
with respect to assets that are available, whether they are public or private, in order to continue to create value for
their LPs or shareholders.
The fact that the US economy continues to grow, that China is weaker, that parts of Europe are weaker highlights
the fact that people indeed want to get even more exposure to the US. With respect to Japan, what's interesting
there is most of our client base are both buyers and sellers of assets, which is to say they're sitting on enormous
yen-denominated deposits but they wish to grow the economy. So that is a market, obviously, where we're active
in the financial sponsor and corporate communities, both in and out; will continue to be. So I am quite bullish
about the full investment bank capability for those that have a global reach. It could take several years and have
some lumpiness along the way, but I think the next three, four, five years will be quite active.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2024
Good morning. Hoping you can provide an update on overall client cash levels within wealth and how you think
about the revenue opportunity as that cash is eventually redeployed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. So we did see the percentage of client cash, so we've given you, I think, 22% in the advisory channel, now
down to, say, 21%, 20% levels depending on what channel that you're looking at. But that, I would say, is not a
function of the actual cash levels coming down but rather than the equity markets have risen, so just to be clear in
terms of the actual mix. The reason I bring up those percentages is there's still high relative to the pre-COVID
historical levels of, say, 17%, 18% that we've given on previous calls, so there is still room to see the deployment
of cash over time into the markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Understood. And as a follow-up, in the release you mentioned about half of the flows came from your family office
offering. I'm not sure we've heard that stat before or – so was hoping you could provide some context in terms of
the size of that business for you. And then also just the mix of flows more broadly in terms of the channels, if you
could provide a few more specifics in terms of the percentage breakdown.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Absolutely. I'm so glad you asked as it relates to the family office offering because we have been talking about it
for some time. We launched and we really formally enhanced our family office offering in 2021. We discussed it
on some of our earnings calls as a place where you could begin to see the integrated firm. And by that, I mean a
way to offer our Wealth Management clients different solutions from institutional securities, so our fund
management products where we're actually able to look at your portfolio from a more integrated basis the way
that you would as an institutional client. As we begin to offer new solutions to our clients, there's more ways to get
touch points with different – and deepen different client relationships and bring them on board, so this is an
example of that.
The reason we point it out is also to highlight to you that there are lumpy flows that come through these channels.
And so, when we say these flows can be lumpy, there are different sales channels across the offering. And those
different channels have different sales cycles. And so, therefore, you will see ins and outs of various pieces of
NNA over time. But in this particular quarter and over the long-term history, we have seen a very diversified set of
channels. We have the workplace, we, obviously, have the advice-based relationship, different pieces of stock
plan, et cetera, that come in through the channel and there is diversification there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward N. Pick A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Morgan Stanley
What I'd add to that is, to Sharon's point on integrated firm, we have this – Sharon made this reference to this
gem of a business that we have in the institutional equities division called Fund Services, which caters to
alternative asset managers and effectively does their documentation work and effectively all of the release to their
LPs.
The question that has been asked over the last number of years is when some of these folks go on to open their
family office and manage their own wealth, what about having a product that has the feel of an institutional
13

product from when they were running their asset manager for their family office or for related business? So, the
folks in Fund Services got together with the folks in Wealth Management who run our outsourced CIO product.
And they effectively came up with a mousetrap that gives the look of an institutional product for folks who are very
much in the ultra-high net worth category. And this helps work towards a piece of the wealth bracket that we've all
been focused on over the last number of years, which is the very high net worth space, which is very competitive.
But in bringing together some of the capability and kit from the equities business over to the wealth business and
have them work together with the Founder in her next life managing a family office, it's actually a nice, seamless
way to keep the funds in-house and to deliver institutional-style capability to clients.
So, this is something we are putting our foot on the accelerator on and is a great example of our equities division
and the wealth management folks are working hand-in-glove to deliver something for clients.

Operator: We'll move to our next question from Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward N. Pick A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Morgan Stanley
Good morning, Devin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities
Great. Good morning, Ted. Good morning, Sharon. A question just on trading. Obviously, results have just been
incredibly resilient and at a high level. And I know you all have spoken about the market share opportunities for
Morgan Stanley, but then there's still this kind of expansion of the overall industry wallet. And so, love to maybe
just hit on that second point. And when you think about that wallet opportunity or the expansion of the wallet, what
are some of the biggest opportunities in kind of the growth algorithms? I think a lot of us are sitting here saying
results have been phenomenal. How can they continue to improve from here? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. I'll take that. When you think about the expansion of the wallet and consider where we came from and
where we are now, as more and more of the corporations and coverage of the corporations is becoming more
integrated, there are many solutions that a bank such as ourselves can offer, be that from a global perspective. If
you think about where rates are as just a tangible example, interest rate hedging that you can offer corporations
as they think about transactions, there are different types of foreign exchange transactions that you could think
about when you're looking at M&A or you're looking at other corporate deals that you have to do in-house for a
global franchise. So, there are corporate solutions that we expect to see growth in from a wallet perspective.
And there's also financing where you have different types of markets and channels that are growing, private credit
being an example, where financing different assets by different types of sponsors are places where we could see
opportunities for a wallet share growth more broadly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward N. Pick A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Morgan Stanley
What I would add to that is we're in the middle of the PE ecosystem with respect to M&A financing risk. If you ask
a number of the asset managers, both real money and alternative asset managers, they would say we are a
partner of choice, so opportunity exists within credit where there's a big focus on the financing side.

It's obviously stable revenue and we're getting after some of the opportunities that lie across fixed income and
inside of our new issue business to originate structure, finance credit, of course a focus on private credit and then
in equities to continue to expand our prime brokerage capability and to build out derivatives. So, this ecosystem
around the financial sponsors who know our firm very well with all of the integrated firm capability, this is a space
and a client base that we are focused on along with, of course, our leading strategic clients on the corporate side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities
Okay. Terrific color. Thanks. And then, a follow-up just on the debt capital markets outlook. Obviously, a very
strong quarter. We have heard a little bit about maybe some pull-forward just on the year in terms of people front-
loading. And so, just want to get a sense of whether you feel like that maybe played out as well for Morgan
Stanley.
And then, when you think about the pipeline for debt underwriting, I appreciate that deals come together quickly
so there's maybe not as much of a formal pipeline. But is the tone there similarly strong, is what you're seeing for
M&A and equity underwriting? And also appreciate there's probably some interconnectivity there as well. Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I would point you to, as you said, there is interconnectivity. Remember that I think many of the peers have
also mentioned there could have been some pull-forward that you saw. It's also been a market that's been open
over the course of the last two years, so I wouldn't draw the same parallel that you might have seen in M&A or in
equity where you had a real dearth of activity the last two years. But rather that market, especially in IG, has been
relatively open when you think about high yield and other non-IG kinds of concepts. And of course, there's the
event-related transactions, but from an IG market that market has been well-open over the last two years.

Operator: We'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.

Edward N. Pick A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Morgan Stanley
Good morning. Good morning, Gerard.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning, Ted. Thank you for taking the call. Ted, you had some very encouraging comments on the outlook
for the capital markets, which is great. A question for you. You mentioned about the high-yield and leveraged loan
market. You're starting to see event financing which is good. How is the competition from the private credit side
because they have made inroads, obviously, in the last couple of years? Are you guys seeing that the traditional
investment banks are gaining some of that market share back?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward N. Pick A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Morgan Stanley
The competition is real and we all need to adapt to stay relevant in the ecosystem. I think there's going to be room
for folks in the private space to participate in deals, but I certainly do not believe as some seem to suggest that

the global investment banks will not have a large role to play as underwriters of securities and all the benefits that
that brings to the issuer versus someone issuing private credit and potentially being the owner over time if things
don't go well. So I think we're in a world where the ecosystem will, at times, have many of the players acting as
partners; sometimes we'll act as counterparties and, at times, even competitors. But I think the ecosystem has
more than enough room on a global basis for both the emerging private credit space but also the incumbents to
continue to be able to do their thing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good, and just as a quick follow-up to that. Once again, your outlook is very encouraging. 10 years up again;
today, there's talk of it moving even higher. The front end of the curve is talking about higher for longer. If we get
into a really higher for longer rate environment, does that kind of weigh on some of the optimism of the outlook
that you presented today or no, it doesn't really have a material impact on it? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward N. Pick A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Morgan Stanley
Well, it's a great question. It depends on whether rates are higher because they are sustaining continued growth
in the US or if they are higher for a period of time and are followed by a tough landing, in which case we're in
recession and clearly then things will slow down. I think our view is that the US economy continues to progress
quite nicely; that balance sheets amongst our client base are quite strong, both on the institutional side and on the
wealth side, and that there is plenty to do; and that the higher rates that we see are, in part, if not more than in
part, dictated by a view that we continue to have some inflation and that the economy is in healthy shape and
maybe asynchronously relative to other places in the world, but that again speaks to US strength.
And as you know, first and foremost, we have our activity based in the US. But over time, there will be strength in
places again like Japan and in Europe and then eventually in the China complex where we will be busy, too. So
my bullishness is not a mark-to-market on any given week or month; it's a view that corporate board rooms have
been quiet for three, four years and that is not sustainable; they need to move. They're ready to move before the
pandemic, then the pandemic came and then there were higher rates; those higher rates seem to be well-
absorbed. Yes, now we need to have models that factor in appropriate cost of capital as we saw in prior regimes
where cost of capital matter. And now we're in a period that comes after financial repression where we'll have
some inflation and some real rates and companies and financial sponsors will adapt and the strong companies
will prosper.
So we are setting up for that and we believe will be a multi-year cycle. And I would say finally that what we're
most excited about, of course, is the model that we are working with both the institutional community but also our
Wealth Management clients to adapt and to optimize as we move into the next cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
