Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Steven Glen Bradshaw
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning. Thanks for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results. The fourth
quarter concluded a second consecutive record year for BOK Financial both from a net income and an earnings
per share perspective. For the full year, net income was $501 million, up over 12% from 2018. Diluted earnings
per share were $7.03 for 2019, that compares to $6.63 last year.
2019 was a broad-based earnings year with significant expansion of our fee businesses and continued strength in
our specialty lending channels, while we also had accelerated growth in our core deposit franchise. Additionally,
2019 saw us achieve our business integration and financial goals for our acquisition of CoBiz, which will help
drive momentum in two of our most critical high-growth markets going forward.
Looking at the fourth quarter specifically, net income was $110.4 million or $1.56 per diluted share, down from our
record third quarter but up 2% from the same quarter a year ago. And as a reminder, we closed on CoBiz at the
start of the fourth quarter of 2018, so the like quarter comparison is appropriate.
Fee and commission revenue was up 12% year-over-year, though seasonal slowdowns in mortgage volumes
along with slightly lower consumer service charges left our fee and commission revenue down 4% from the
previous quarter.
Expense management remains prudent, though expenses did increase 3% this quarter due to elevated severance
expenses as we worked to rightsize our business units heading into 2020, coupled with our annual charitable
contribution to the BOK Foundation (sic) [BOKF Foundation], which provides support to many nonprofit partners
in the communities that we serve. Our loan loss provision was $19 million this quarter due to some migration in
our energy portfolio, and Stacy will cover that in more detail here in a moment.
Turning to slide 5, average loans were $22.2 billion, that's up 3% year-over-year, though down from last quarter
due to general paydowns in energy and commercial real estate, and two anticipated large year-end paydowns in
our C&I portfolio. Having said that, we feel good about our pipeline opportunity in the early start here in 2020.
Average deposits were up 8% from the previous year and up over 5% on a linked-quarter basis. Even with the
strong growth this quarter, we were able to bring overall interest-bearing deposit costs down from 1.17% in the
third quarter to 1.09% in the fourth quarter.
Growing deposits to fund loan growth was a significant area of emphasis for BOK up in 2019 and you can see
that in our results. This focus will continue into 2020 allowing us to fund future loan growth.
Assets under management or in custody were up over 2% for the quarter and more than 8% year-over-year.
Strong sales activity coupled with favorable equity markets were really the key drivers of that expansion. And we
saw an opportunity to further invest in our company at a favorable price this quarter as we bought back 280,000
BOKF shares at $81.59 per share in the open market.
I'll provide additional perspective on the results at the conclusion of our remarks, but now Stacy Kymes will review
the loan portfolio and credit in more detail. I'll turn the call over now to Stacy.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Thanks, Steve. As you can see on slide 7, period-end loans were $21.8 billion, down more than 2% for the
quarter. While paydowns impacted our quarter end numbers, 2019 was a growth year for BOKF from a loan
perspective, up 3% on average year-over-year. Total C&I expanded nearly 3% in 2019, though paydowns in our
two largest growth engines, energy and healthcare left total C&I down 2.7% linked quarter.
Energy had a fantastic year in 2019, growing nearly 11%. While the segment was down $141 million for the
quarter, the trends in the industry we've discussed remain true and pipelines remain full. I expect our energy
growth to return to a positive level as we head into 2020. Our healthcare channel also had an exceptional 2019,
growing over 8%. Though the quarter was flat, steady growth in commitment levels and our expertise in the senior
housing space bodes well for another great year for healthcare in 2020.
A slowdown in general C&I seems to point to increased cautiousness in the general middle market business
community. Tariffs, trade disputes and the questions that arise heading into a new election cycle seems to have
caused pause for some of our clients. Future clarity around the regulatory, trade and economic environment
should help reenergize the middle market segment.
Continued discipline around concentration limits in commercial real estate, coupled with late-quarter paydowns
left the segment down 4.2% for the quarter. Commitment volume is still solid in this space and we'll continue to
high-grade through stringent customer selection as we manage the portfolio.
On slide 8, you can see that credit quality overall remains good. Non-accruing loans increased $8.5 million this
quarter, primarily due to $6.6 million increase in a non-accruing community development credit. Net charge-offs
were $12.5 million or 22 basis points on an annualized basis, up from $10.6 million or 19 basis points in the
previous quarter, all relatively consistent with what we have seen over the past 18 months. Potential problem
loans, which are defined as performing loans that based on known information caused management concern as
to the borrower's ability to continue to perform totaled $160 million at December 31, up from $143 million at
September 30.
This increase largely comes from the energy portfolio as the capital markets environment is requiring certain
customers to work through their liquidity needs. This situation may lead to additional nonaccruals and some
impairments. However, as we've discussed previously, our senior secured collateral position should protect us
from material loss content. Based on evaluation of all credit factors including changes in non-accruing and
potential problem loans, as well as specific impairments of two shared national energy credits which we are not
the lead agent, the company determined that a $19 million provision for credit losses was appropriate for the
fourth quarter of 2019.
I'll turn the call over to Steven now to cover the income statement in more detail. Steven?

Thanks, Stacy. As noted on slide 10, net interest income for the quarter was $270.2 million, down $8.8 million
from the third quarter, as the full realization of the last two Federal Reserve interest rate cuts were felt in the
quarter. Net interest margin was 2.88%, down from 3.01% the previous quarter. I have provided on the slide a roll
forward to highlight significant items impacting the NIM calculation.
First, accretion levels were $5.1 million less this quarter due to the lower CoBiz loan payoffs, which reduced NIM
by 6 basis points. Second, higher loan fees in the fourth quarter improved NIM by 3 basis points. Third, there was
a 9 basis point decline in our noninterest-bearing funding profile with a decrease in demand deposits and an

increase in receivables from our trading activity. In addition, our earning asset yield decline, excluding accretion
and fees of 29 basis points, was effectively offset by a 28 basis point decline in funding cost. While net interest
income and margin have moved down over the past few quarters, the projected flat interest rate environment in
2020 should allow some stability going forward.
On slide 11, fees and commissions were $179.4 million, an increase of 12% quarterly year-over-year, fueled
largely by strength in our brokerage and trading business. Brokerage and trading increased over 56% from the
same quarter a year ago. While overall, brokerage and trading was relatively flat in the quarterly comparisons,
growth in trading revenue was up $5.6 million, but was offset by lower customer hedging revenue and loan
syndication fees.
Mortgage banking revenue was down 16% from an expected seasonal slowdown. However, 2019 was a great
year for the mortgage channel as the favorable rate environment allowed us to grow the business 16% compared
to 2018.
As we enter 2020, we remain confident in our origination capabilities even in an expected flat rate environment.
Fiduciary and asset management revenue was up over 3% linked quarter and year-over-year as strong sales
gathering activities and favorable equity markets had fueled steady growth. Other revenue was down due to the
variable nature of repossessed asset revenues from certain oil and gas properties that are contained in that line
item.
Turning to slide 12, total operating expenses increased $9.5 million to $288.8 million. Personnel expense
increased $5.8 million for the quarter. Incentive compensation increased $2.6 million linked quarter due to an
increase in cash-based incentive compensation primarily from the sales activity and wealth management and
commercial banking.
Regular compensation increased $3 million largely due to the severance cost from a realignment of personnel for
the operating environment headed into 2020. Non-personnel expense was up $3.7 million from the third quarter
largely due to our typical year-end charitable contribution to the BOKF Foundation of $2 million.
The mentioned pressure on net interest revenues moved our efficiency ratio back over 60% this quarter. While a
60% or lower efficiency ratio is still our long-term goal, it will be influenced by the mix of revenue going forward.
Slide 13 has our current outlook for 2020. Average security balances remain comparable to current levels as we
manage to a relatively neutral interest rate risk position, average loan growth around 3% to 4% with lower growth
in energy compared to 2019. Average deposits are expected to cover loan growth for the year.
Net interest revenue is expected to remain relatively flat compared to 2019 given overall lower interest rates for
the year. Stable net interest margin from the current level with a bias towards slight improvement if the overall
minute interest rate environment remains flat. Fee revenues grow mid-single digits with continued growth in
brokerage and trading and assets under management and wealth. Efficiency ratio is slightly above 60% as fee
revenues grow faster than net interest revenue.
Day two CECL provision levels will provide for loan growth and will be influenced by changing economic outlook.
We are not expecting any meaningful changes in the historic loss rates during 2020 that drive our models. Tax
rate approximately 21% of pre-tax income. We will continue to provide sufficient capital for loan and balance
sheet growth, a competitive dividend payment, and a modest level of opportunistic share repurchases. Capital
ratios are expected to improve slightly over the course of 2020.

And lastly, I want to share the updated transition impact of CECL that we expect to book on day one. After many
test runs, we expect the pre-tax transition adjustment to range between $60 million and $65 million which is in the
middle of the range we provided last quarter. We have elected to phase in the impact of CECL transition on
regulatory capital over a three-year period.
I'll now turn the call back over to Steve Bradshaw for closing commentary.

Steven Glen Bradshaw
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Steven. 2019 was an outstanding year for the organization and one that's really a testament to the
diversity of our revenue model. 2019 proved more challenging for the industry as a whole compared to 2018, as
we faced some pretty significant revenue headwinds when interest rates moved lower starting in mid-year. While
this pressure typically contracts the earnings potential of regional financial institutions, we saw a strong surge in
revenue from our fee-based business units that performed exceedingly well when rates decline. This was no
accident. We are purposefully built to perform under any economic cycle.
And though we remain optimistic in our ability to continue to grow our business in 2020, the headwinds of lower
rates and the economic uncertainty that's always exaggerated in a national election year may well prove
challenging. However, we have always taken a long-term approach to building shareholder value and that focus
will continue to guide our decisions on how and where we invest in the company going forward.
With that, we're very pleased to take your questions. Operator?

Just wanted to start off with expenses, hoping to get a little more clarity in terms of maybe $1 amount of expenses
because it looks like this quarter was certainly higher than expected even backing out the severance and the

charitable contribution. And I know your guidance is – that it's going to be above 60% on the efficiency ratio. But
can you just – probably little more guidance in terms of like what dollar amount is the right number to be thinking
about here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I think when you look at 2020 and the kind of revenue that we think we'll create in the fee businesses, I think
that's one of the reasons, I feel like the efficiency ratio is going to be a little higher than 60% is because our fee
business revenue growth is going to be more than our net interest income growth.
And when you have fee revenue growth, it comes with a little bit higher expense base, commissions and other
activities there that just drive a little bit higher efficiency business in terms of the percentage. And so I think a
level, you want me to point to an exact dollar level. I think it's – out in the 2020, it's going to be closer to where we
are here at this $288.8 million. Somewhere plus or minus in that area I think going forward for 2020 is probably a
pretty good expense level to use.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Glen Bradshaw A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, Ken, and this is Steve Bradshaw. One thing that's always a bit of an anomaly in fourth quarter is that – that
we have a number of people not only just in the fee businesses, but also in a lot of our lending areas that have
annual incentive targets and it becomes – while we accrue for those throughout the year as we track it, it
becomes more certain when you get in the fourth quarter. So we always see a little bit of lumpiness on the
incentive comp side as we're accruing for the year-end bonuses, so. I don't disagree with the way Steven
characterized that, but I do think Q4 always has a little bit of incremental incentive comp – cost in it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got – understood. And then, two really quick questions for you. The first question is, when you see your capital
ratios you're willing to improve, I guess whose perspective is that? I mean, do they go up or they go down over
the course of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I think what we're trying to do is just improve those ratios just modestly, okay?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Meaning, they'll go higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
They go higher.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

So how the percentages go, just a little bit. We're not talking about a lot of capital accumulation here. I think we'll
continue, as I mentioned, to pay a good strong competitive dividend. We'll take advantage of the market where we
can opportunistically and stock buybacks. But I would like to see the ratio go up just slightly, over 20 points.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
When you look at the guidance for 2020, you say stable NIM from current level. I'm assuming that means a stable
NIM from the fourth quarter level of $288 million. Is that the way to read that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
That's correct. That's what we think.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then how – I mean when you look at accretable yield levels, the $5.8 million in the fourth quarter was
the lowest level you had in all of 2019. I know that is a shrinking bucket. But how do you think yield accretion will
trend in 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
I think that $5.8 million was a little bit lower than I honestly expected and I really think 2020 will fall somewhere in
the kind of $25 million to $30 million range of accretable yield. I don't know how it's going to fall by quarter, but I
think that's the level that you should probably expect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then finally just on deposit costs, I know when we spoke 90 days ago, you guys were saying deposit
costs could be flat to if not up a little bit. You saw deposit costs down in the fourth quarter. Maybe talk about the
option of continuing to reduce deposit costs from here or do you think they've kind of bottomed at this 4Q level?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
This is Stacy. I mean, I think if you look at what we did in the fourth quarter where we increased deposits about
$1.5 billion but yet reduced overall deposit costs as you mentioned, I think that was a huge win for us in terms of
continuing to move deposit costs down as we looked forward. I still think you're going to find opportunity to
continue to lower deposit costs. If LIBOR moved immediately as the Fed moved, deposit costs lagged, they
lagged going up. They're going to lag going down. That gives us some opportunity as we move into 2020 to
continue to improve our deposit costs as part of our funding and hopefully that translate into improvement in the
NIM as we move into 2020 as well.

your questions.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, guys. Just wanted to touch on the loan growth outlook. Looks like 3% to 4% full year average to full year
average. I guess I'm trying to reconcile that with the difference between the period end balance and the average
balance for the quarter, looks like there might have been some paydowns or some charge-offs obviously at the
end of the year, and trying to reconcile that with some of the comments around some softness around the middle
market and energy not growing as much as we move forward. So if you can just help me square that, I'd
appreciate it. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Absolutely. Well, we had really pretty good loan growth throughout the quarter. It was really in the last couple of
weeks of the quarter that we saw paydowns in both energy and commercial real estate. We've seen a nice
rebound in outstanding balances early in January, so we're hopeful that some of those paydowns that you saw
are revolving in nature and will come back.
If you look at where we grew last year, energy grew at 11%. We're clearly not forecasting energy to grow at that
level as we move forward. We don't think you'll have – you will have some lumpiness as we've had in previous
periods around quarter-over-quarter growth, but as you look at long-term growth, being in that 3% to 4% range is
something that we feel very good about.
We don't think that the fourth quarter was a trend in any respect. As we looked at the nature of some of those
declines, there was seasonality in some of the businesses that we have on the C&I side. They tend to fund up in
the middle of the year and then pay down at the end of the year. Energy had paydowns. We had paydowns in
commercial real estate.
We don't think that's really representative of what we're going to see as we move forward, and certainly that has
held to be true here very early, admittedly, in this new year. So I feel very good about the guidance that we've
provided in that 3% to 4% range and certainly don't see anything today that would make me think that that's not
achievable.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for the color. And then maybe just switching gears to energy, maybe for Marc, where – can you just
give some greater color on maybe what caused some of these issues for these two energy SNCs? I assume it
probably has to do with the company's run out of cash. If you can just give some color there and whether they
were gas-related or oil-related? And then has anything changed as it relates to your thoughts around energy
lending as we move forward as an asset class? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, first on the – taking energy as a class, what's – nothing's really changed on how we're approaching it. What
we're seeing in the market is really there is an impact from the capital markets and the A&D market being a bit
closed in certain circumstances and natural gas prices and NGL prices are lower right now. So that is causing
some issues for certain credits. But, again, we're continuing to be 78% E&P first lien secured deals.
From a gas price perspective, 95% of our customers have some form of hedging, like, we don't really look at it on
a portfolio basis but we are pleased that we've seen our customer base pursue hedging as a way of protecting
their downside risk. As it relates to specific credits, we kind of monitor those on an individual basis and don't really
get too detailed about what's going on on particular deals.
And will, I can tell you that we feel very strongly that our workout team is in certain circumstances is taking all
steps necessary to minimize whatever exposure we have and minimize the amount of loss such that we really feel
like going forward in 2020 we will continue to have our 12-month loss in the 25 base – 20 to 25 basis points which
is consistent with what we've had in the past. Maybe a little lumpy in the first quarter, but going forward we don't
see it getting out of whack with what we've had historically.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Can you talk about some of the drivers to the 3% to 4% average loan growth because – especially with energy
which was the main driver for 2019 is going to slow and just general middle market a little bit of caution there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
This is Stacy, Peter. Certainly, energy will continue to be a driver for us. I certainly don't want to indicate that it's
going to not grow next year. We think there's going to be opportunity there. We grew 11%. I don't think we'll grow
11%, but I think we can grow mid- to high-single digits inside of energy, which is obviously a large portfolio for us.
We have ample room under our commercial real estate limits to continue to grow there. Our teams there are
continuing to see opportunities that we think are positive and reasonable from a credit risk to take at this point in
the cycle. So, we think we'll see growth there.
Healthcare has been an area that we continue to grow and invest in, and you see that good growth for the year in
healthcare. We have high expectations for that team in 2020, and we think we'll continue to grow there.
Where some of the softness is is maybe on the lower end of C&I where you may have a sole proprietor or a single
business owner who is kind of a little bit more cautious about the macro environment. But we think that clearly, if
you think about what we've done on the wealth side, we grew our lending side in the wealth space strong double-
digits last year, and we think that will be a growth driver for us in 2020 as well.
So, as you kind of add the pieces together and roll that forward into 2020, we certainly feel very confident that
something in the 3% to 4% range is very achievable for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And on the fee income side, you talked about brokerage and trading and wealth. I'm just wondering, can
you talk a little bit, Steven, about the outlook for mortgage banking in 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So I think we have good origination capability across our footprint. We feel very confident with the purchase
market there and our ability to serve that market. And so I do think it'll be a little lower in total for the year of 2020.
But I think we've got a great approach and a good process, and we're pricing pretty well. We've got good
discipline there.
And so I feel confident that we can achieve some pretty good results in mortgage. It may not be at the same
revenue level that we achieved in 2019 given the different rate environment. But I do feel pretty good about the
continued growth in that sector.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then just my last question, I know you guys have done a lot of work on reducing expenses at the bank.
I'm just wondering, with a tougher revenue environment, are there still opportunities to cut expenses at the bank?

Steven Glen Bradshaw A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Peter, this is Steve. We actually really worked in earnest on that initiative really going back into the fall
when it became apparent that we were going to see further rate cuts and have more pressure on the net interest
revenue side in 2020. You saw us take a little over $2 million in severance cost in the fourth quarter, and that was
really just identifying where we thought we had some opportunities across the board.
We're also curtailing some of the expansion of new positions across the bank as well. There's always
opportunities and we're always seeking an opportunity to improve efficiency. We're being careful not to do that on
the backs of reducing our investment commitment from a technology perspective. That's important to us
competitively and we continue to make strides there. But no question, we'll have a hyper-focus on expenses really
throughout 2020.

Hey. So two questions. One on the deposit side, you gave obviously, Steven, the sequential quarter change in
deposit costs. Could you give us any inter-quarter color in terms of deposit cost, maybe where they were in
December?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
No. I mean, I don't have that in front of me exactly what they are in December. I just know the composite deposit
cost for the quarter. As Stacy mentioned earlier, we were happy to see that go down from 1.17% to 1.09%. As he
mentioned, I think there is opportunity there to continue to drive that down a bit. But beyond that, I probably
wouldn't comment further.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And then broader perspective on the Oklahoma economy. We're hearing that maybe there's a bit of a
slowdown there, lower tax receipts, there's been some job cuts, I think, at some of the larger energy companies in
the state. Can you talk about kind of the perspective for the broader Oklahoma economy?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Glen Bradshaw A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Oklahoma is doing well. I think the decline in tax receipts is largely driven by declines in gross production taxes as
there's been less drilling in the SCOOP and the STACK here in Oklahoma. But kind of corporate taxes and
personal income taxes have held in very well and are actually slightly up a little bit.
So, I think the Oklahoma economy is doing well. We don't see any weakness. Really, the job cuts seem to be
being able to be absorbed by the economy in a reasonable period of time. So, we're not seeing kind of inherent
weakness there understanding that there is some dislocation from time to time with certain companies. But there's
job growth here too that's able to absorb that and state is doing well.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Hey, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I want to go back to, I think, it was Peter's first question on loan growth drivers in 2020. And Stacy, it sounds like
energy will be a decent part of the driver. And I think energy is now around 18% of loans outstanding. Can you
just remind us what your internal limits are on this asset class? And with the higher charge-offs that we saw this
quarter from energy, is there any pause or concern about growing this book in the future? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure. We have ample room inside of our concentration limits. We don't see anything that would be a constraint on
our ability to grow it other than the opportunity to find good deals. And if you look at actual net charge-offs, we've
been in this $10 million to $12 million per quarter now for a while. I don't see the fourth quarter as an anomaly
from that perspective. I think it's very consistent. And actually if you go back and look at the fourth quarter last
year, I think net charge-offs fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter almost identical. So we're – as Marc alluded to,
we're kind of providing some guidance that we think net charge-offs will be in that 20 to 25 basis point range next
year for the full calendar year.
There could be some of that that's front loaded earlier in the year as some of these near-term issues work
themselves through the process. But we still feel very good about this space. You talk about net charge-offs in
energy this year, they were higher than last year. They were at about 91 basis points or so in the E&P space. But
if you think about the sector overall, we're getting 100 to 125 basis points additional spread on those loans. We
think we'll continue to see some opportunity to improve that in 2020 as others think about their exposure here.
But we like this business through the cycle. We understand that this has been a longer term ebb and flow in this
industry than we've seen in a while. But we have a great team, the credit teams and the line are working great
together. We have a great engineering staff. We think that we're well-positioned to be able to manage through this
and do it in a way that is good for the shareholders and good for us. I think we've talked about there will be some
lumpiness in criticized and classified and nonaccruals and you see that a little bit. But even with all that, our
nonaccrual loans are less at the end of the fourth quarter than they were at the end of the second quarter.
So there's a little bit where we're going to go up, there's a little bit where we're going to go down, but it will ebb
and flow and it's at a level that we believe is very manageable. And for the full year, we're going to have 21 basis
points in net charge-offs for the company. We think that's going to compare very favorably to our peer group. And
so, it's an asset class that clearly is in the media a lot. There is issues with around liquidity in the space to a large
extent but we're working through that, and I think we're very well-positioned to manage that.
We're still as energized, if you will, around energy as we ever have been because we think that it's an important
part of our DNA as a company. And we continue to want to emphasize that as a core product offering for BOK
Financial.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for that color, Stacy. And then sticking on the credit discussion, the press release mentioned that
nonaccrual loans did tick up and I think it was pointing to a $7 million increase from that multifamily community
development credit. Can you tell us more about this credit and is that part of the senior housing portfolio?

Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
It is not a part of the senior housing portfolio. This is a very low income housing tax credit deal that we made as
part of our investment in the communities that we serve. It has demonstrated some weakness since it has been
slower to lease up. But leasing is commencing. It's just moving at a slower pace. We don't foresee any real
significant loss. I won't say zero loss, but certainly not any that's significant related to that new nonaccrual loan in
the fourth quarter.

Few follow-ups. Steven, maybe for you, early on when you talked about the NIM, you said it was the full
realization of the last two cuts. We talked a little bit about deposit pricing. But I'm just curious, are you saying that
you feel like the earning asset yield pressure that we saw last quarter has essentially run its course? Is that the
message that you're sending?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
I think a good portion of it is, yeah. When you think about the number of – the percentage of LIBOR-based loans
that we have, they've re-priced effectively. And so, I think the majority of that is in the numbers.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Okay. Good. And then, Stacy or Steve, maybe for you, this general slowdown in C&I that you talked about and I
think you used the term pause and maybe it's a confidence issue. Obviously three months ago it was maybe a
little bit more pessimistic and things are a little more optimistic today. Have you seen any of that pause or
confidence improve a bit in the last three months or is it just more of the same?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
I think the environment on the middle market and lower-end middle market C&I side has been relatively consistent
over the last few months. I think as we begin to get more certainty around some of these things, I think you'll see
continued opportunities for people to invest in their business, buy a new piece of equipment, add a line, grow and
expand the business.
But today that's not been an area that we've seen a lot of growth in, certainly outpacing GDP growth. We've talked
for many years about kind of being able to outpace GDP growth. You can do it a little bit but not a much and not
consistently, and if you do, then be careful. And so I think that's kind of what we're seeing is just kind of slow
steady growth, not high-single digit kind of growth in that space.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. Talked about two large year-end expected paydowns. Can you give us an idea of the size of those,
how material they were?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
No, we didn't have – we had paydowns broadly in both – in really three areas, in energy and commercial real
estate and in our wholesale retail sector. Just portfolio paydowns, they weren't large credits. Some of that
cyclicality on one of those in the wholesale retail sector tends to fund up in the summer as they go through the
kind of Christmas selling season and they buy inventory, and they tend to sell down as cash flow comes in during
that period of time.
Energy and commercial real estate were just kind of the nature of the business, nothing unusual there particularly.
But as I look at the early part of 2020, I see a nice rebound there and so I'm certainly optimistic as we move into
2020 that that was not a trend but just kind of a late fourth quarter anomaly. Sometimes you see those kinds of
things, Jon. I don't know if it's balance sheet dressing for some of those companies or not, window dressing but
we'll see that and tend not to react to that real strongly based on what we see late in the fourth quarter as we
move forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right. I may have misheard you on that but that helps. And then last one, it sounds like you still – you
have quite a bit of room in commercial real estate but you mentioned concentration limits a couple of times. Can
you just remind us of the themes and kind of the guardrails on that?

So, commercial real estate is based on both of our limits in energy and commercial real estate are based on
committed not outstanding. There are 175% of Tier 1 capital in reserve for commercial real estate. I think it's
225% of Tier 1 capital in reserves for energy, that we've got ample room to grow consistent with the guidance that
we provided above those faces. We don't have any overwriting concerns that our internal concentration guidelines
will be a constraint for growth in those areas in a meaningful way in 2020.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
First question, I just want to circle back to some of the commentary on energy. I'm wondering if some of the
weakness in energy market is manifesting itself in other industries and if so, how much of that is driving the
commentary around the sluggishness in middle market C&I?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A

You're talking just a broader spillover effect in the broader kind of Colorado, Texas and Oklahoma economy.

Timur F. Braziler Q

Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
It's a natural conclusion to see that and wonder about that. It's not obvious to me at this stage that that's what
we're seeing.
If you think about, really from my perspective, this is the kind of a tail of this original downturn that happened in
2015-2016. I think it was more pronounced in that period of time. I think where we are today it's not nearly as
pronounced and it's a little bit more steady state from that perspective. I'm not necessarily – it's a good question,
but I'm not necessarily seeing a direct tie at this point to the slowdown in general C&I to the weakness – to some
weakness that's being demonstrated in it could be. I think that was more obvious and pronounced several years

ago. But as we've stabilized in this kind of $55 to $60 price for oil, particularly in our footprint markets, I think that
that's less of an issue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then maybe switching gears to the deposit growth this quarter, pretty impressive. Was that just the
culmination of the work that's been going on that kind of all-hit in the fourth quarter? And I guess looking at some
of the initiatives that have been taking place, what's still remaining and how should we think about deposit growth
heading into 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
So, deposit growth is something that Steve laid out for us as an important initiative to kind of try to grow deposits
to fund the loan growth in 2019. And as you go through that process, it's a hard – it's a ship that doesn't turn
immediately. It takes a lot of time and effort to begin to cultivate and identify the opportunities. If you look in the
fourth quarter, Scott Grauer in our wealth team really did an exceptional job of bringing in great deposits priced at
reasonable levels. They were a big driver for the deposit growth in the fourth quarter. But the commercial
businesses did a great job with that as well.
Really, just as a result of the long-term effort kind of the culmination of an effort that's been going on for a while in
terms of moving the deposit needle. As we think about 2020, I think our really desire is kind of growth at a
reasonable price. We want to grow to continue to fund the loan growth, but we're very mindful of ensuring that
we're paying attention to the cost of those deposits and doing everything we can to minimize the impact to our net
interest margin as we think about growing deposits in 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just last one for me, looking at mortgage banking revenue versus expense and the disconnect
there this quarter. Is that a timing issue or was that a true-up on incentive for the strong year and if...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
The biggest driver of the revenue side is commitment levels. And then, the expense side is really tied more to
loan fundings. And so, if you look at loan fundings, they're pretty level. And so, the work that had to take place to
get loan fundings completed in the mortgage banking cost line item is there. But the revenue side is more
influenced by the commitment levels at the end of the year which did drop off. So that's kind of the disconnect,
this timing.
