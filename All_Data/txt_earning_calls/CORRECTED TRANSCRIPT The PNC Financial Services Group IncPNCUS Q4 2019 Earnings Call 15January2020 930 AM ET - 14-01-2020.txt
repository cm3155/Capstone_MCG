Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody.
You saw today that we reported full-year 2019 results with net income of $5.4 billion or $11.39 per diluted
common share. For the full year, we increased earnings per share, achieved record revenue, improved our
efficiency ratio, and generated positive operating leverage. Overall, it was an excellent year for PNC, capped by
another solid quarter.
We reported fourth quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $2.97 diluted per share. During the quarter, we grew
loans, deposits and revenue. And while our provision increased, overall credit quality remains strong. Rob's going
to take you through the full details of our financial results in just a second. And we remain dedicated and diligent
in our continued investment in our businesses and technology to drive long-term growth.
Along these lines, I was very pleased with the continued progress we made this quarter on our key strategic
initiatives, including the national expansion of our middle market and retail banking efforts. We remain committed
to growing our business, but also maintaining an efficient organization capable of achieving positive operating
leverage.
I would like to spend just a minute to thank our employees for all their efforts to make 2019 a successful year. We
achieved a great deal this past year for our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve, and none of
it would have been possible without the combined efforts of our more than 51,000 employees working toward our
common goals.
As 2020 begins, we expect to face uncertainty in the year to come from the economic environment to the
ramifications of international trade disputes, the geopolitical situation and the presidential election campaign in the
US, but we're excited about the momentum with which we've entered the year, and along with our increased
capital flexibility as a result of the tailoring rules, we believe our strategy focused on our customers – our strategy
and focus on our customers positions us well to continue to deliver for all of our constituencies.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob and then we'll be happy to take your questions.

Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned, we reported full year net income of $5.4
billion or $11.39 per diluted common share, and fourth quarter net income was $1.4 billion or $2.97 per diluted
common share.
Our balance sheet is on slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Total loans grew $1.2 billion to $239 billion
linked quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, growth was $13 billion or 6%. Investment securities of
$83.5 billion decreased $1.7 billion or 2% linked quarter due to portfolio runoff primarily in treasury. Year-over-
year total security balances increased $1.4 billion or 2%.
Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve averaged $23 billion for the fourth quarter, up $7.7 billion linked
quarter and $6.6 billion year-over-year, primarily as a result of strong deposit growth. Deposits grew $8.7 billion or

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
3% linked quarter and $21.3 billion or 8% year-over-year. As of December 31, 2019, our Basel III common equity
Tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 9.5% compared to 9.6% at September 30.
For the full year 2019, we returned $5.4 billion of capital to shareholders. This represented a 22% increase over
2018 and was comprised of $1.9 billion in common dividend and $3.5 billion in share repurchases. Of note, the
tailoring rules became effective January 1, 2020 and as a result will provide us increased flexibility in managing
both our capital and liquidity levels going forward.
As we announced earlier this morning, we've received approval from the Federal Reserve to repurchase up to $1
billion in common shares through the end of the second quarter of 2020, which is in addition to the share
repurchase programs of up to $4.3 billion approved by the Fed as part of PNC's 2019 capital plan. This will
provide us the ability to repurchase additional shares over the next two quarters, the level of which will depend on
market conditions.
Our return on average assets for the fourth quarter was 1.3%, our return on average common equity was 11.5%,
and our return on tangible common equity was 14.5%. Our tangible book value was $83.30 per common share as
of December 31, an increase of 10% compared to a year ago.
Slide 5 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $239 billion in the fourth
quarter were up $1.2 billion compared to the third quarter. The growth was driven by consumer lending which
increased $1.9 billion or 3%, reflecting higher residential mortgage, auto and credit card loan balances.
Commercial lending decreased $738 million linked quarter, as growth in our corporate banking business was
more than offset by declines in our real estate business, primarily due to a $1.1 billion decrease in our multifamily
warehouse balances. Compared to the same period a year ago, average loans grew 6% or $13 billion.
Commercial lending balances increased $8.6 billion and consumer lending balances increased $4.4 billion, each
growing by 6%.
As the slide show, the yield on our loan balances declined in the fourth quarter, primarily the result of lower
LIBOR rates. Importantly, the rate paid on our deposits also declined 15 basis points linked quarter, an
acceleration in the pace of the decline from the third quarter of 2019. Deposits of $288 billion increased in both
the year-over-year and linked quarter comparisons. The year-over-year increase of $21.3 billion or 8% reflected
strong customer growth.
Linked quarter deposits increased $8.7 billion or 3% due in part to seasonal growth in commercial deposits.
Notably, non-interest-bearing deposits grew $1.5 billion or 2% in the fourth quarter. Both comparisons benefited
by a $3.4 billion increase related to the new sweep deposit product program we began offering our asset
management clients in September.
As you can see on slide 6, full year 2019 revenue was a record $17.8 billion, up $695 million or approximately
4%, driven by both higher net interest income and non-interest income. Expenses increased $278 million or 2.7%
and remained well controlled. Importantly, we generated positive operating leverage of 1.4% in 2019.
Our full year provision was $773 million, an increase of $365 million compared to 2018, which was driven by
strong loan growth and continued credit normalization in our loan portfolio. Our effective tax rate in the fourth
quarter was 15.1%, down from the third quarter as a result of lower state income taxes and tax credit benefits. For
the full year, our 2019 effective tax rate was 16.4% and reflected the lower fourth quarter tax rate.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Now, let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to slide 7, you can see our total
revenue has grown consistently over the past several years, driven by our diverse business mix. Full year 2019
net interest income was approximately $10 billion, a record for PNC, and an increase of $244 million or 3%
compared with 2018 as higher loan balances and yields were partially offset by higher funding costs.
Our net interest margin decreased in 2019 to 2.89%, down 8 basis points compared to 2018, driven by the
declining rate environment throughout the year. For the fourth quarter, net interest income of $2.5 billion was
down $16 million or 1% from the third quarter. Lower loan and securities yields were substantially offset by lower
funding costs.
Net interest margin decreased 6 basis points to 2.78% in the fourth quarter, mostly due to the effect of lower
interest rates, primarily LIBOR. Although lower rates reduced our borrowing costs, that benefit was more than
offset by the downward impact of LIBOR in our commercial loan yields.
Full-year 2019 non-interest income was up $451 million or 6%, and increased $132 million or 7% in the fourth
quarter compared to the third quarter. Importantly, we continue to execute on our strategies to grow our fee
businesses across our franchise, and those efforts helped to drive record fee income of $6.4 billion in 2019.
During 2019, fee income increased $183 million or 3%, reflecting strong customer growth in our legacy and new
markets. Growth was across all categories except service charges on deposits. The $12 million or 2% decline in
service charges on deposits was reflective of our ongoing efforts to simplify products and reduce transaction fees
for our customers. Fourth quarter fee income of $1.7 billion increased $18 million or 1% compared to the third
quarter.
Taking a more detailed look at the performance in each of our fee categories, asset management fees increased
$40 million, driven by higher earnings from PNC's investment in BlackRock. Consumer service fees declined $12
million or 3%, reflecting seasonally higher credit card activity that was more than offset by a full-year true-up of
credit card rewards.
Corporate service fees grew $30 million or 6% across various categories and included growth in our treasury
management product revenue. Residential mortgage non-interest income decreased by $47 million, driven by a
lower benefit from RMSR hedge gains as well as lower loan sales revenue. Service charges on deposits
increased $7 million or 4%, reflecting seasonally higher customer activity.
The final component of our revenue, other non-interest income, increased $114 million compared with the third
quarter. The growth was primarily driven by higher revenue from private equity investments and a gain of $57
million related to the sale of our proprietary mutual funds. Partially offsetting this was a negative Visa derivative
valuation adjustment of $45 million.
Turning to slide 8, our full-year 2019 expenses were $10.6 billion, an increase of $278 million or 2.7% compared
with 2018, as we continue to invest in our strategies, technology, and employees. Taking a look at the fourth
quarter, expenses grew by $139 million or 5% linked quarter. Personnel increased $68 million due to higher
benefits, including a special year-end grant to more than 51,000 of our employees, mainly in the form of health
savings account contributions totaling $25 million. Personnel also reflected higher incentive compensation
associated with business activity in the fourth quarter.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Equipment expense increased $57 million, largely due to $50 million of technology-related write-offs. These write-
offs primarily resulted from the benefit of the tailoring rule, which now allows us to decommission compliance and
regulatory systems that are no longer required.
Our efficiency ratio for the full year 2019 was 59%, improving from 60% last year. As you know, expense
management continues to be a focus for us. We had a 2019 goal of $300 million in cost savings through our
continuous improvement program, and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal. Looking forward
to 2020, our annual CIP will once again be $300 million, which we expect to contribute to the funding of our
business and technology investments.
Our credit quality metrics are presented on slide 9 and remained historically strong. Full-year provision for loan
losses totaled $773 million and net charge-offs were $642 million in 2019, reflecting our strong loan growth and
some credit normalization in our portfolio.
On a linked-quarter basis, provision increased $38 million in the fourth quarter due to both consumer lending and
reserves attributable to certain commercial credits. Net charge-offs increased $54 million to $209 million in the
fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. Commercial charge-offs accounted for $24 million of the increase,
driven primarily by a few specific credits. And consumer charge-offs grew $30 million, mostly related to our credit
card and auto portfolios.
Reserves to total loans remained stable year over year at 1.14% compared to 1.16% at year-end 2018.
Annualized net charge-offs to total loans was 35 basis points in the fourth quarter, and while up, this is still well
below our through-the-cycle average. Notably, the leading indicators for credit quality continued to perform well.
Non-performing loans were down $59 million or 3% compared to year-end 2018. And year-over-year total
delinquencies were up $19 million or 1%.
As you know, we adopted CECL, the new accounting standard for credit losses, effective January 1, 2020. Based
on our expectation of forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances as of December 31, 2019, the
adoption will result in an overall increase of approximately $650 million or 21% to our allowance for credit losses
at December 31, 2019. The increase is driven by the consumer loan portfolio, as longer-duration assets require
more reserves under the CECL methodology.
Our consumer reserve will increase approximately $900 million or 95%, and our commercial reserve will decrease
approximately $250 million or 12%. These metrics include reserves for unfunded commitments. We plan to
include a full description and transition details in our upcoming 10-K disclosure.
As we move forward under CECL, it is a new accounting standard with many variables, and as a result, we expect
more volatility in our quarterly provisioning. Our allowance for credit losses will be determined using various
models and estimation techniques, utilizing for example, historical losses, borrower characteristics, economic
conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, as well as other relevant factors. For expected losses in our
reasonable and supportable forecast period of three years, we'll use four macroeconomic scenarios and their
estimated probabilities.
Given the multiple variables impacting provision expense under CECL, during 2020 we'll shift from our current
practice of providing a quarterly provision guidance range to providing forecasted charge-offs levels. However, in
order to establish a context for the level of change in provision expense under CECL, for this upcoming quarter
we'll provide a range for expected provision expense based simply on expected charge-offs level plus CECL
reserve rates for net new loans. This guidance will assume our economic scenarios and weights remain constant.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
And should any of these variables change either favorably or unfavorably, our actual provision expense may also
vary, possibly materially.
In summary, PNC reported a successful 2019 and we're well positioned for 2020. Throughout 2020, we expect
continued steady growth in GDP and we expect interest rates to remain relatively stable.
Taking these assumptions into consideration, our full-year 2020 guidance compared to full year 2019 results is as
follows. We expect loan growth to be in the range of 4% to 5%. We expect total revenue growth to be in the low
end of the low single-digit range, which includes approximately 1% of net interest income growth. We expect
expenses to be stable, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 17.5%. Based on this guidance,
we believe we'll generate positive operating leverage of approximately 1% in 2020.
Looking at first quarter 2020 compared to fourth quarter 2019 results, we expect average loans to be up
approximately 1%. We expect total net interest income to decline approximately 1%, reflecting one less day in the
quarter. We expect fee income to be down approximately 3%. We expect other non-interest income to be
between $300 million and $350 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect expenses to be
down in the mid-single-digit range, and we expect provision to be between $225 million and $300 million.
With that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
...as you said. But regarding the quarter, can you give us a little bit more color behind that $225 million to $300
million? How much of that is the CECL day two component? And then how much of that is reflecting underlying
credit trends? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, sure, John. So for the first quarter guidance, I kept it simple. And we're just going to take forecasted
charge-offs, which we expect to be at the same level that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2019, and then
add to that the CECL loan loss rates of the fourth quarter of 2019 to our projected loan growth, and that's the
simple math.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. Okay. And that is carrying forward like you said or assuming that fourth quarter charge-offs level of 35
basis points, which was up a fair amount from last quarter and from the year ago, so that's the normalization
you're talking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Can you give us a little bit more detail around that normalization? I know you mentioned card and auto. But also
you've had several commercial credits come up over the past several quarters that have been impacting. Is there
a trend that you're seeing on the commercial side as well? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hey, John, it's Bill. We talk about normalization and we have for years where our charge-off rate is below what we
would expect to see through the cycle. But I would tell you our near-term pressure on charge-offs is more related
to card and auto than anything else. And it's not really related to changing in the economy.
We dipped our toe into some – the lower end of our credit bucket probably a year ago, and those vintages are
starting to play through. We've subsequently shut that down six months ago. So it's going to work its way through
the snake here. But I don't actually see personally that charge-offs are so much normalizing because of the
economy per se as we have some elevated consumer stuff that will reverse through time.
The other thing that we had a big debate internally just on what to guide as it related to provision going forward,
because CECL and the impact to CECL has so many variables on what provision will be. We can reasonably
8

forecast charge-offs. But, of course, outlook on economy, mix of loan growth, pace of loan growth, and many
other factors ultimately impact how that provision's going to behave beyond charge-offs. So we're giving it our
best shot. It could be high or low.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right. Well, it's new. CECL is new, and it's been a lot of work as you know both in terms of what we've done as
we ran through parallel in 2019 to establish our transition amount. But going forward, we feel good about our
framework. We've got a three-year reasonable and supportable forecast. We've got the four macroeconomic
scenarios that we'll detail in our 2020 disclosures. But to Bill's point and what I said in my opening comments,
there's just a lot of factors, and then on top of that, it's new.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So there's just going to be some learning curve aspects to sort of the practical application of CECL real time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. And on the C&I side, John, we really haven't seen anything that you'll see some specific credits we're
adding to. By the way, we've been doing this for five years. What's changed is the recoveries that we've gotten
through time...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, that's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
...way back from the crisis are gone. So it's not so much that our new stuff is elevated in any given point as our
recoveries have dropped.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And if I could just ask one more on the margin side, I know you gave the spread
income guidance for the linked quarter and for the full year expectation. But how do you think the margin will
traject from here? Should we see some stabilization now that we have the pause? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I think so, John. We expect rates to be stable. We don't have NIM guidance officially.
That's more of an outcome. But I think we'll spend most of the – if everything stays constant, we'll spend the next

year pretty much in this range. We could actually go up in a particular quarter as deposit costs are continuing to
come down, but not a lot in either direction.

William Stanton Demchak A

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
I just wanted to ask a little bit more detail, Rob, about – on the previous question. So how should we think about,
one, the opportunity to deploy what seems like an extra $6 billion to $7 billion of cash? What opportunities you
see for that cash going forward? And also, deposit costs trending down sort of balancing what has been a really
successful initiative to go beyond your legacy footprint with reflecting lower rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Okay. Well, through the first part about that in terms of the new LCR requirements, we have and we will continue
to work down our cash balances to the new requirement of 85%. The first step is, we talked about this on the third
quarter call, is to pay down some short-term debt, and then take a look going forward in terms of where we would
deploy that. Unfortunately, securities yields aren't terrific. So, I don't think we're going to move quickly in that
direction, but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
The simplest thing to do is to let some of our wholesale borrowings run off...

And on the deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I was just going to say, on the deposit side, we have been reasonably aggressive in dropping rates and has
still been able to grow balances both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing, so we're going to continue to
pursue that.
One of the things that's happening in the background here, of course, is the Fed over the last two or three months
has been injecting cash back into the system through their repo activities, which means the fight for deposits that
11

was pretty intense is letting up somewhat as cash comes back into the system. And I'm not exactly sure how
that's going to play out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just taking a step back, is there a difference in terms of stickiness in terms of the deposits that you
raise through, let's say, a high-yield savings account versus a checking account that you are offering a cash
incentive to open?

So the national deposits have been much more sticky than we expected because at least as an individual, Erika, I
kind of assume that unless you converted it to a full-time account, which we've had some success at doing, I
assume people would shop those rates and move.
We actually haven't seen that be the case, even though we have dropped really pretty far below the competitive
band on what we're offering. Now I'm sure there's elasticity to that, but thus far, we haven't seen much movement.
The upfront money on checking accounts, which all of us do where you open the account and you swipe your
debit card five times and so forth...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
...there's a lot of mischief in that. So we've had – the percentage of people who basically are taking the cash
going through the motions and never using the account have made that option less attractive to us than some
other things we're doing.

been stickier than what we would have expected.

I just wanted to ask on the $1 billion supplemental authorization. I was definitely glad to see that. But just in terms
of how you came up with the $1 billion, I imagine it ended up given the timing and the CCAR cycle being as much
art as science. But just given where you sort of fleshed out, what does it say about sort of dry powder for the next
cycle and/or other preferences for capital use at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Rob can jump in here. But as I mentioned at the Goldman conference, the ask that we put in had nothing to do
with tailoring. So it was basically capital that we had in excess from 2019 independent of rule change. As to the
amount beyond the fact that $1 billion is a nice round number, you have to remember that our existing program is
a pretty big program.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, all right. That sounds...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
That was the art of it rather than the science of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Fair enough, fair enough. And then just separately, I guess I can sort of back into it, but, Bill, I think you had noted
back in, I think it was December when you sort of switched the NII outlook for 2020 given the changing rate profile
and had suggested maybe up 1% in 2020, I imagine that that still holds true. But any update on your thinking
there, and then just overall balance which becomes more self-explanatory between NII and fees as the year
progresses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think it still holds. What's helping us there is, we are forecasting pretty good loan growth for 2020. Our pipelines
look good. So when we do that, we see up approximately 1% as achievable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, perfect. And then maybe the main fee drivers as you see them for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think on the fees, we're in good shape, and our fee businesses are big. They're all growing. So I think we'll see a
consistent trajectory that we've seen in 2019.
Just going through the broad categories, asset management, BlackRock, the component – the BlackRock
component will still do what they do. The P&C component will have a little bit of – will have same-store sales
growth but will have a little bit of a challenge in 2019 numbers because we divested those businesses and in fact
sold some revenue.
But corporate services, consumer services we see staying on the trajectory that they've been on. Residential
mortgage could be off a little bit, but that's pretty small for us. And then service charges on deposit we see as
being kind of flat because we'll see more client activity. But as I mentioned in my comments, we are working
toward eliminating a lot of those nuisances that our customers have experienced, and we want to get ahead of
that. So that will kind of offset one another. So fees are good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q

Good, all right. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi, guys, two follow-ups. In terms of consumer lending, I know you have a long-term goal to remix towards a little
bit higher contribution from consumer lending. Does the CECL or the experience dipping your toe in auto and card
that you mentioned in some of the lower spectrum, does either of those change your appetite or the degree to
which you might be growing consumer loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
No. I would – I mean a couple of comments. The issue we had by going a little bit down in our risk bucket – by the
way, that's not a huge amount. It's kind of flowing through. Our team is supposed to do that test and learn and
see, and we learned. We didn't like it. We move on, but we're growing. Independent of that, if you just look at the
balances that we've grown in card, and in auto, and in resi and even home equity, I guess, this quarter...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
First time. First time in a while.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. They're executing really well and that will continue. The issue for CECL, of course, is – in today's
environment, it's an easier answer to say yes, we'll keep growing home equity and resi on the balance sheet,
because the loss rates, the loss content is so low even in the CECL reserve.
The challenge will be in a more pressed economy and environment where charge-offs and losses are higher, will
you be booking loans that effectively cause negative income in the year you booked them in. That's a discussion
we'll have at that period of time. I do think as I've always said that CECL in general will hurt consumer lending,
particularly when it's needed most as people pull back because of the financial pain from the reserves. But in
today's environment, I don't see...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. And to your question, John, we have no change in terms of our strategies for growth because of CECL.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And then in terms of the CET1 that you ultimately target, does tailoring affect how you think about what you
should run at over time? And have you made any kind of fine-tuning on that and just kind of remind us that target
range, Rob?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, sure. So tailoring is obviously going to add some flexibility to our capital ratios. In terms of tailoring alone,
we see our capital raise CET1 ratio going up about 60 bps. That's including opting out of AOCI, which hurts by
about 20 basis points. And then with CECL, CECL will affect CET1. That's another 19 basis points, 20 basis
points.
So net-net-net, tailoring CECL, we see our capital ratio going up about 40% (sic) [40 basis points]. That's where
we are today. So that adds a lot of flexibility – basis points. I'm sorry, 40 basis points, 9.9-ish, from 9.5% to 9.9-
ish. So that's a lot of flexibility. We've talked about a target in the 8% to 8.5% range. So we've got room.

Can you guys give us some color, I jumped on the call late, so I apologize if you touched on this. Rob, you
mentioned the outlook for loan growth this year. It's actually one of the better...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can you share with us, some of your peers have told us that there seemed to be a change in business
confidence, if you will, or sentiment in the fourth quarter with these trade deals, looking like they're coming
together. Can you guys share with us what your customers are telling – your commercial customers are telling
you about how they feel about business for 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, as it relates to trade, I think there's a lot of wait and see as to what's really there and how it impacts people.
So I don't know that people have really changed. They've been – and you've seen it in manufacturing and CapEx,
they've been a bit on the sidelines. Eventually they're going to have to spend simply to replace dated stuff. But I
don't know that we've seen that yet.
Our growth on the C&I side continues to come from specialty businesses and our geographic expansion. And
probably one of the things that makes us a bit of an outlier just in terms of growth is once we turn consumer
positive, which we've done, the totality that the loan book is growing and we just haven't had that in the past.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Gerard Cassidy Q

Very good. In fact, that was going to be my second question, Bill. Can you guys kind of share with us how much

base.

winning these customers in these new markets? Is it just better products that you have that your competitors don't
have for the customers that you're targeting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It's a number of factors that start with really good people. It includes bringing to our new markets the totality of
PNC with our regional president model, with our community involvement. And yes, it's dependent on our products.
We show up in a market, we get embedded in the community and centers of influence. We go in with our
foundation and grow it great. We pick the clients we want to cover and bank long-term and we're very patient. We
will call on them for two and three years before we get a shot on goal.

And when we get that, our products are very good particularly in comparison to some of the smaller in-market
players. We've been doing this going all the way back to the RBC acquisition, and it works. We use the same
playbook in each market that we go into. We talk about breaking even inside of three years. We've been able to
do that with all the vintages and we'll keep going.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A

Yeah. Gerard, I would just add to that, and I've said that before. There's just great receptivity of these corporate
clients and prospects for the PNC calling effort. And once that dialogue goes as Bill said, then we compete well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
The other thing that I would just remind you, and this is important, the potential criticism that somehow we are out
just participating in other loans is not at all accurate. When you look at our cross-sell rates in those markets,
they're pushing 50% fees of total revenue, which is not wildly off of what we do in our legacy markets.

what else is helping underneath the surface kind of clamp down on that overall rate of expense growth that gets
you closer to flattish? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, sure, I mean it is that. No, we're not backing off of our investments or anything along those lines. We just
think that the continuous improvement program that we have in place is the strength of the company that we can
achieve in essence 3% cost savings to fund these investments on an annual basis. And that's something that
we've been very good at and that will continue. So, I don't think there's a whole lot that's changing under that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q

Ken Usdin Q

...the securities portfolio, right, so you're growing loans a lot which – and you're able to pay down wholesale debt.
So, does the mix of earning assets continue to push more towards higher-yielding loans and you just kind of keep
the portfolio in check. How do you balance the left side of the balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
A little bit, but that's a little bit in that direction, but it's not that dramatic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, at the end of the day, we are underinvested today. We're certainly going to invest runoff, we'll
probably grow. One of the things going on in the background here is, on the receive fixed swap side, because the
curve steepened out, while we had largely gotten out of or lowered our position, we're back into that. So you can't
just look at the securities book in terms of the way we're actually investing against the yield curve. You can think
about it in terms of cash, but it's not necessarily the sole tool we use to manage the balance sheet.

Hi, guys.

Hello.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So there was obviously a lot of commentary just on the strong capital and you generate a lot of capital. Just as we
think about like various uses of that capital as far as buybacks, dividends, maybe you could talk about some of
other potential uses. Bill, you've been pretty clear how you feel on bank deals, but what about loan portfolios?
We've seen some branch divestitures from other people doing deals, acquiring technology, fee deal opportunities,
just kind of the whole portfolio of options? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It's a fair question. And you should assume that we look at loan portfolios. We continue to do so. We look at a lot
of stuff. We look at product add-ons, and you've seen us do that in small size in terms of capabilities in the C&I
space, things we would do in retail. And we'll continue to be rational actors in terms of how we spend the capital.
We have been pretty clear on our thoughts on depository institutions, and that hasn't really changed. So we'll let
this play out. It's nice. If you think about the environment that we are going into, notwithstanding the strength of
the economy, the volatility of kind of what comes in an election year, I think having a lot of capital and being able

to generate a lot of capital is a really good thing, simply because of the opportunities that are likely to present
themselves here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then just long term, you've talked about trying to boost growth on the consumer side. And obviously, over the
years, there have been asset generators available or big credit card portfolios and you haven't done any of those.
But if you look out kind of next five-plus years, it does seem like that could be an opportunity for you. You've got
all these deposits. I know you're not a huge fan of holding a ton of securities if there are other options...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
...but any change in thinking of that, again, like looking out long-term, maybe now is not the right time in the cycle,
but that is how one big difference between your balance sheet and say USB's and others?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Look, you never say never, but my experience is the consumer asset generators that come up for sale are
broken, number one. And number two, we aren't the house to fix them. We are a prime lender in consumer that's
focused on customer experience. We aren't a subprime lender, which typically most of these people play in. We
don't understand it. We don't want to be that person. The fact that if they're for sale, they blew up, they didn't
understand it either, suggests to me that all else equal, you won't see us, you won't ever see us do that. Now, you
never say never, but that is my likely guess.

We said that for some time. That's not a new view.

The flip side of that, by the way, on the C&I side, we're really good at fixing busted C&I. So big portfolios that are
troubled or lenders that are troubled show up with big portfolios, that is something we pursue. That's in our
wheelhouse.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. A question on provisioning and CECL. So I think your reserve ratio is about – I think
ended the quarter at about 1.15% or 1.16% I think. And with CECL on January 1, that gets trued up – well, it will
show up in the first quarter results, but it will get trued up based on the fourth quarter to 1.4%.
As I think about provisioning going forward and some of the dynamics around that reserve ratio, how do I think
about growth in the marginal growth of your portfolio versus that 1.4%? Are you growing in loans that on average
have materially higher loss content than 1.4%? And how do we think about that mix change in terms of how to
think about provisioning versus charge-offs in ALLL ratio evolution?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
You'll drive yourself insane. I can tell you think through...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
All else equal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right. Yeah. The issue is if we grow in the same categories today, you wouldn't necessarily have the same loss
content because, for example we shut off the lower FICO scored consumer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
If we shift to secured products in C&I versus unsecured products, it shifts. If we do more card than we do resi
mortgage, this thing is going to be really hard to predict. And what we have to do and we will do is give you in
effect a provision attribution each quarter so that you understand...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It's part of the disclosure – yeah, which is part of the disclosure, that's right.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Right. And look, the lost content...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
The thing to remember is we have more reserves right here at day one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So the 1.4% is going to 1.5%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, so we got a lot of reserves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. No. Fair. But like to the extent mix is changing and there's no change in your strategy and the trajectory
which has seen auto, cards grow disproportionately, albeit from a lower base, I would think that if that trend
continues, your loss content and your expected losses over time, assuming all else equal which I know is
unrealistic, I mean, shouldn't we assume that your ALLL ratio given current trends should move higher from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
The challenge with that is the assumption that the absolute growth in consumer will somehow keep pace with the
absolute growth in C&I, which it won't, simply because C&I is disproportionately larger. So, yes, consumer will
grow, but you've got to remember that that's balanced by larger C&I book growing just as fast.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right. That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Right. So the balance growth is much bigger just from – okay, got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
That makes sense. Okay. All right. That's very helpful. Thanks.
