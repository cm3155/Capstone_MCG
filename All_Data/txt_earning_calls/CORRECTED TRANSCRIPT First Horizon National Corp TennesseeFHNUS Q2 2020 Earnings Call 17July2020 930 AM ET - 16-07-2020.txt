Ellen A. Taylor
Head-Investor Relations, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Thanks so much. Good morning everybody, and thanks so much for joining us. We know it's the end of what's
been a really busy week. On our call today, our CEO, Bryan Jordan; and CFO, BJ Losch, will provide an overview

Our remarks today will reference the earnings presentation which is available at ir.fhnc.com. I should note that we
will make forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and you should review the factors
on page 2 of our presentation and on our SEC filings that may cause our results to differ from those expectations.
Our statements reflect our views today and we aren't obligated to update them. We will also address our adjusted
results in our remarks through non-GAAP measures, and you should absolutely review the GAAP information in
our supplement and on page 3 of our presentation.
With that, I'm going to hand it over to Bryan.

D. Bryan Jordan
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Ellen. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us in our call. In this most unusual environment,
pandemic-related economic slowdown, we've had a very good quarter and I'm very proud of the work that our
team has accomplished. On July 1, we closed our MOE, our merger of equals, with IBERIABANK. This merger
creates a leading southern franchise with strong demographics and the ability to drive efficiency and create
significant shareholder value.
Given the disruption created by the COVID-19 pandemic, our associates across the expanded platform have
been working to tirelessly support clients and communities by originating PPP loans, providing loan deferral
assistance, waiving fees, all while effectively managing risk. At the same time, they have continued to ensure that
execution on the IBERIA integration as well as the branch acquisition, remain on track.
Our expanded franchise strengthens our geographic reach and depth, provides improved ability to better serve
our customers and community, provides enhanced growth opportunities, and gives a scale to compete more
efficiently. This quarter, we delivered solid results with strong PPNR growth driven by strong fee income
performance and good expense discipline as our countercyclical businesses help mitigate environmental
headwinds. Our fixed-income business delivered strong results and NII remained relatively stable as we grew
average loans led by loans to mortgage companies and the PPP portfolio.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
During the quarter, we built our loan loss reserve by $93 million, raising our allowance to loans coverage ratio to
1.6% or 2%, excluding lower risk loans to mortgage companies and the PPP portfolio. We are continuing
heightened monitoring and review of the loan portfolios in order to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on our
customer base and ensure that we are prudently managing risk while helping support customers and the
economy overall. BJ will give you details about economic assumptions supporting our reserve level but I believe
we're taking appropriately cautious view.
In the quarter, we further bolstered our capital with debt and preferred share issuances. As expected, our CET1
ratio increased over 70 basis points linked-quarter to 9.3% which positions us well as we look toward the second
half of 2020. While we acknowledge that the microeconomic backdrop and industry landscape remain very
challenging, we believe our combined company remains well-positioned to drive enhanced shareholder value
over the medium term.
With that, I'll turn it over to BJ to take you through the details. BJ?

Great. Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. Happy Friday. As I'm sure you know but as a reminder our
MOE with IBERIA closed on July 1. Therefore, the 2Q results, I'll be discussing, are for First Horizon standalone.
Later, I'll give you some highlights of IBERIA's standalone results for the quarter as well as some key legal day
one impacts from the merger closing that you should expect to see in our 3Q results.
With that, let's start with some highlights of our second quarter adjusted results. As Bryan mentioned, we
delivered strong PPNR growth, which was up 13% linked-quarter and 2% year-over-year. Despite the challenging
interest rate environment, macroeconomic backdrop revenue was up 7% in the quarter and a 11% year-over-year
driven by strong fee income growth with stable net interest income results.
We think this quarter, in particular, really highlights the benefits of our countercyclical fixed income and mortgage
warehouse lending platforms that are helping mitigate some of the headwinds that we are seeing across the
banking industry. We generated nice balance sheet growth and continue to manage our deposit costs down, and
given the environment, we continue to be highly focused on expense discipline.
Our core CECL is the factor driving provision costs higher for the banks overall and as we updated our models for
the further downdraft in the economic outlook compared to March, we built our loan loss reserves by an additional
$93 million or $0.23 a share.
Moving to slide 7, you can see that solid loan growth and disciplined deposit pricing helped us generate modest
NII growth in the quarter despite a 26-basis-point decline in the margin. As a reminder, our asset sensitivity is
most highly correlated to one month LIBOR, which was down 105 basis points on average during the quarter,
pretty significant pressure on loan yields.
In addition because of strong customer liquidity, the NIM was pressured further by excess cash balances, which
created an additional 9-basis-point drag on the margin. At the same time, we continued to lower our deposit cost
overall, which were down 40 basis points in the quarter and the margin benefited from the addition of over $2
billion of PPP loans and the associated fees, which helped to offset some pressure from lower accretion.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
As we look forward while it will be challenging to offset the additional headwinds from the rate environment, we
will continue to look for opportunities to bring deposit pricing down further and more efficiently manage the
balance sheet while still maintaining a prudent stance on liquidity, given the uncertainty in the overall landscape.
Looking forward, we could see the NIM compress further possibly in the mid-teens range, primarily due to the
addition of the Truist branches. Those branches will provide about $2 billion of additional excess funding, which
will further improve our liquidity profile, loan and deposit ratio and profitability over time, but will temporarily
depress the margin while we find ways to put the excess funding to work over the next few months.
Briefly on slide 8, fee income was up 18% linked quarter and 31% year-over-year. The fee income growth was
driven by strength in fixed income and deferred compensation, [ph] partially (00:08:40) offset by lower deposit,
card and other bank fees given impacts from COVID. While our more traditional banking fee income lines were
challenged in the quarter as others have seen across the industry, given that some of our markets have begun
reopening, we did start to see some improvement at the end of the quarter in debit card and ATM volumes as well
as a pickup in wealth.
Fixed income revenue, in particular, was up 19% linked-quarter and 77% year-over-year as we saw strong sales
activities and a turnaround in trading results following the challenging conditions that occurred in March. As a
result, the team delivered average daily revenue of $1.6 million during the quarter compared with $1.3 million in
the first. Given the overall landscape, we believe the fixed income business remains very well-positioned to
capitalize on its extensive distribution platform and experienced sales force to drive continued solid results.
On slide 9, quickly cover expense trends as we may remain committed to a highly disciplined approach to
managing the cost base. Given the swing in market valuations, we saw an increase in employee compensation
cost driven by a $20 million increase in deferred comp related to market changes, which is offset by increases in
other income.
Outside of this, our results benefited from lower stock-based compensation, FAS 91 deferrals and lower operating
costs overall, largely tied to impact of the shutdown. Importantly though, we were able to take an additional $3
million of costs out in connection with our IBERIA merger during the quarter as was IBERIA.
So overall, we have achieved a total of $10 million in merger savings between the two companies over the first
half of this year, meeting our expectations we set back in November when we announced the transaction. We
continue to be very confident in our ability to generate the merger cost savings of $170 million over the next 18
months.
On slides 10 and 11, we provide a view of our loan growth and funding profile. As I mentioned, we generated
healthy average loan growth of 11% linked-quarter and 18% year-over-year, driven by loans to mortgage
companies, which were up on average $1.7 billion linked-quarter reflecting strong refi volume due to low rates.
We also picked up $2 billion in PPP loans as well and the balance of the C&I portfolio saw declines tied to lower
line utilizations from the peak that occurred in early April as commercial customers position started to improve in
the wake of government programs and re-openings, resulting in a reduction in the defensive draws that we saw in
the end of the first quarter.
As Bryan mentioned, customer sentiment remains cautious, and we do expect only modest loan growth at best for
the second half of 2020. At the same time, we've continued to work to further enhance our funding mix and capital
stack. Deposits were up 11% linked-quarter driven by strength in DDA and savings. In the regional bank, we saw

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
customer deposit rates pay decreased to 24 basis points from 59 basis points. Overall, we lowered our interest-
bearing deposit cost 52 basis points in the quarter to 38 basis points.
And while the mix of our deposit base will be a little different going forward than in the last rate cycle, with the
addition of IBERIA and the Truist branches, we do think it's helpful to note that in the third quarter of 2015, our
interest-bearing deposit costs ended at 15 basis points. We also felt that in the face of continued economic
uncertainty, it was important to continue to augment our capital and liquidity stacks. Since April, we've issued
$1.25 billion of senior sub-debt and preferred securities, we issued $800 million of holdco senior debt, prefunding
of $500 million maturity coming due in December, $450 million of banks sub-debt and $150 million of holding
company preferred.
On slide 12, you'll see that as expected, we had a nice bounce back in our capital position from unusually low first
quarter levels that were driven by outsized period-end loan growth, primarily, from loans to mortgage companies.
The CET1 ratio was up over 70 basis points to end the quarter at 9.3% while total capital increased 170 basis
points to 12.5%.
Our strong PPNR, sub-debt and preferred issuances and a reduction in risk-weighted assets drove our capital
levels higher and gave us ample cushion as we prepare for the future. While there will be many moving parts next
quarter, obviously, as we close both the IBERIA transaction and the Truist branch acquisition, sitting here today
we would expect our CET1 ratio to be in the low 9s in the third quarter.
Additionally on slide 13, you can see, we ended the quarter with really healthy levels of reserves, allowance for
loan losses totaled $538 million or over eight times annualized net charge offs. We built a reserve by $93 million
entirely attributable to anticipated further deterioration in overall macro trends. We think it's important to note that
while our models most heavily weighted the Moody's May 27th baseline scenario, we supplemented this with
alternative scenarios and did very detailed portfolio reviews of industries currently affected by the pandemic.
We also incorporated additional factors such as the re-emergence of COVID cases, additional geographic data, in
fact, its stimulus programs and overall economic uncertainty. For your reference, we have a detailed table in the
appendix that shows reserve coverage by portfolio. Our coverage again excluding PPP and loans to mortgage
companies which have exceptionally low to no loss content and stands at around 2% on a standalone basis.
Moving to slide 14, you can see that overall the asset quality picture still remains relatively benign. While we
continue to monitor our loan portfolios carefully, the net charge-off to average loans ratio came in at 20 basis
points, with the losses this quarter driven primarily by two credits, one loan in energy and the other in the
franchise finance portfolio.
We've given some details on deferrals at the bottom of the page. And as you can see, total deferrals of both
commercial and consumer portfolios were at $3.8 billion, representing low percentages of customer accounts
overall. Interestingly, more than 40% of customers that asked and received deferrals, have made at least one
payment since being on deferral status. We will continue to work proactively with these and all of our customers
and monitor the portfolios carefully.
Let's shift now to slide 15 and look at IBERIA results and expected impacts from the closing of our MOE. First, we
provide IBERIABANK's standalone second quarter financial highlights on slide 15. We plan to file pro forma
financials for the combined company later in the quarter but thought it was important to provide some information
to continue to illustrate the power of the new, expanded, and more diversified franchise. IBERIABANK also
delivered solid PPNR, which was up 7% linked-quarter.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Net interest income was relatively stable as loan growth of 7% linked-quarter was more than matched by 8%
deposit growth, helping to mitigate some of the interest rate headwinds. IBERIA generated record fee income up
over 30% in the first quarter and over 45% year-over-year, fueled by strong momentum in mortgage origination
income with a healthy mortgage pipeline at the end of the quarter. Of course, provision expense in the quarter
was up significantly as well given the impact of the updated outlook in the macro environment.
But now let's move on to cover our expectations for the impact with our merger accounting on slide 16 and 17. As
of July 1, we updated our estimates for the marks on a portfolio based on the current landscape and a detailed
review of those portfolios. You can see on slide 16 that we expect to record a total of $720 million or 3% of loans,
including total marks of $560 million for credit and interest rate/liquidity and $160 million of non-PCD double-
count.
This $720 million of total initial marks will show up as follows: approximately $460 million of it will go into the
allowance for loan losses; approximately $260 million, $160 million related to the non-PCD discount and the $100
million of interest in liquidity mark will be an initial reduction of capital but will accrete back through net interest
income over time. And at the bottom of the slide, we had laid out for you our current estimate of the timing of that
accretion coming back into income and capital.
In the table at the top of the page, you can see that we now currently estimate total credit of the total credit marks
that are a little over half or about $12.6 billion of the portfolio will be considered purchase credit deteriorated,
PCD, with the remainder of the portfolio designated as non-PCD. It's important to note that the PCD designation
as defined by CECL does not mean that the loans are bad, and it's not intended to be an indication of perceived
loss content associated with the portfolio. So the initial marks will reduce our CET capital by about 20 basis points
at close.
On page 17, you can see the current estimate of the merger accounting adjustments, which will result in a roughly
$500 million non-taxable gain that will be recognized through the income statement in our third quarter results
with a roughly $2.8 billion addition to tangible common equity.
On page 18, we provide a reminder of the $170 million in expense savings that we are targeting for the combined
company in connection with the merger. And as I mentioned earlier, we have achieved around $10 million so far
in the first half of the year with $6 million in this quarter alone. We expect to have an exit run rate at the end of
2020 of 25% of our targeted cost saves, and we are well on our way to achieving that. Our integration efforts are
on track and we are confident in our ability to deliver on the savings and the benefits of the merger with the strong
belief that we will be able to exceed our targets.
So with that Bryan, I'll hand it back over to you.

Thanks, BJ. With our strong balance sheet, business mix including our countercyclical businesses, our strong
capital base and liquidity, they will all serve us well in this difficult environment. We have maintained underwriting
standards that are very strong and built a diversified portfolio focused on profitability. Despite the economic
headwinds, we're uniquely positioned to capture merger opportunities with enhanced scale, better efficiency and
improved earnings power to create shareholder value.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
If we look at loan growth, excluding the mortgage warehouse and excluding PPP, I think period end balances
were down a little linked-quarter. Maybe just comment on – I saw utilization went down. Probably, maybe just
comment on if 2Q's loan growth kind of ex-warehouse and ex-PPP and then, BJ, I heard you say, you expect
modest loan growth at best for the back half year but maybe just a little more color on how you're thinking about
loan growth going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Brady this is Bryan, I'll start, and then Susan or BJ can pick up. The loan growth on an absolute basis
outside of PPP and mortgage warehouse was down a little bit. Most of that was driven by what you saw in the
significant line draws that occurred late in the first quarter in the March timeframe when the economy started
shutting down more broadly, those lines paid down. If you look at the loan growth through the second quarter, you
could characterize it as BJ did earlier is reasonably modest. Most of the new loans were to existing customers
and tended to be at levels that would be very low relative to say the last 18 months or two years.
But our expectation is that we will have some activity that the line draws have sort of worked their way through the
system that we'll continue to support customers, both existing and opportunities, to take on customers in the

marketplace but we don't expect to have tremendous amount of loan growth throughout the rest of this year, at
least, until we get to the other side of this pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
The only thing I would really add, Brady, is we remain very focused as we always have on full relationships. And
so we continue to work with our client in some prospects that we brought into the PPP program but we remain as
you can imagine very prudent in our underwriting and have a higher level of review for new extensions of credit.
But we do believe that there could be some limited opportunities that as Bryan said, would expect loan growth
would remain in the lower range, certainly compared to the last 18 months to 24 months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I would just add one more thing. I mean, Brady, we're definitely open for business. It's not that question. It's
just lower activity from clients looking to extend credit because of – like Bryan talked about the pandemic. There's
just obvious caution across portfolios but we'll continue to look for good opportunities to continue to grow
customer relationships.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's helpful. And then next on your common dividend, I think there has been some investor focus on
your dividend post, when we saw the CCAR results. But you didn't earn the dividend last quarter, you earned it
this quarter but the payout ratio is pretty high. If you included the $500 million gain next quarter, you will earn it by
multiples, but how are you thinking about the stability of your dividend going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Brady, this is Bryan again. The board considered the dividend every quarter and then we looked at the rules
that have at least been publicly made available from the Fed, and our modeling and our outlook indicates to us
that we will be in a position to continue to recommend our dividend to the board of directors. I would say that as a
backdrop while we are confident in it, we don't know what we don't know about this economy and it's important
that the board not only looks at dividend but looks at capital and capital adequacy long-term. So that could
change, but based on our modeling, based on our outlook, based on our understanding of the rules and the Fed
framework, we feel very confident that we will be recommending to our board that they consider continuing the
dividend at the current levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then finally a quick one, BJ, it was helpful to have the forecast for the yield accretion for the next few
years. That is just probably the scheduled yield accretion, right, that doesn't include any unscheduled, so reality is
what some payoffs, you'll probably see numbers a little higher than that. Is that the right way to think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. That's correct. Yeah, it's going to be based on – this is based on our assumed timing and you're right if
there's an acceleration then there could be a change, much like we've seen in other transaction, Brady.

Operator: Our next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rahul Patil Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Hi. This is Rahul Patil on behalf of John. I just had a question around the, the loan mark. So I know in mid-April,
you had provided an update around the loan mark, and I believe the total mark around that time was around $500
million to $550 million. And then one could argue that the macro has kind of worsened since mid-April through the
deal closed in July. How come that didn't influence the credit market? I'm looking at the total loan marks at $560
million right now, how come that didn't influence the credit mark? And then also it looks like the rate mark of 40
bps is sort of consistent with the level that you had announced back in November 2019 and obviously, rates have
come down quite a lot since then. And I'm just wondering like how did that not influence your rate mark, because
it looks like that also stayed at 40 bps. So just a couple of clarification questions around that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Sure, so – it's BJ. So, yeah, it's been a wild ride on trying to estimate marks between November of last year and
today. And so like you said, we gave interim updates during the course of that. So if you recall back in November,
we would have had credit marks assumed that announcement of 1.2% and interest rate mark of about 40 basis
points. So that would have been 1.6%. The interim that you're referring to, would have captured a little bit more of
a credit mark but a substantially higher interest rate/liquidity mark. And I would put more emphasis on the liquidity
mark.
So when we put out that, that disclosure back a couple of months ago, it was at the height of the liquidity crisis
and the fear in the markets before the Fed programs had fully been rolled out. So the assumption was much
higher on the liquidity and interest rate mark. Subsequently, markets have gotten a lot more liquid that liquidity
and interest rate mark has come back down, but our expectations around the future outlook on credit have
deteriorated.
So all in all, our credit mark is higher by probably 40% than what we would have thought back in November.
Interest rate/liquidity marks interestingly enough kind of landed in the same place, but as you can see in the table,
the mix of the PCD and non-PCD has changed materially as well. So, lots of moving parts in here. But the bottom
line is we feel very comfortable that our teams have done great extensive work on the valuation that we're building
very healthy reserves that go into the allowance. And we've got additional loss absorption capacity that will
accrete back through income over time to the tune of about $260 million. So we're very comfortable with the
estimates that we've got.

Okay. And then just a question on First Horizon's standalone expense base. So I believe, it was like six months
ago, your expectations for First Horizon's expense base was around $280 million, $285 million per quarter. And
I'm looking at 2Q numbers on a core basis, it came in around at $318 million. So that $30 million differential,
obviously, partly is driven by this stronger fixed income business performance, but how much of that differential in
your expense base do you expect to normalize in coming quarters? Or should we kind of expect like that $320
million is like the normal sort of run rate for First Horizon assuming fixed income kind of stays strong?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So how I describe it is that the increase that you're talking about is all related to two things: one is as you
mentioned fixed income variable compensation, which comes with additional revenue that we gained. So there's
50% net positive benefit to our pre-tax income from that additional expense. And this quarter, we had deferred
compensation expenses that were quite mature early in the quarter as well. We don't expect those to continue
that's – that will certainly moderate.
So we still believe that we'd like to see fixed income remain strong, which we think it will. So, I would, if I were
you, take out the deferred compensation impact in this quarter, and then once we start to look at our companies
on a combined basis, start to layer in the merger-related cost saves, and we expect to see meaningful declines
over time in our expense base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
BJ, one more that I would add to that list is the provision for unfunding credit, which was $11 million this quarter,
$9 million last quarter vis-à-vis a year ago it was essentially zero.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
But those two are fairly significant, and they're pandemic related in the sense that they're related to potential
credit losses for unfunded commitments that just happens to flow through our expense base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. That's a great point. I just want to bottom line or reiterate, we have done an excellent job of managing our
expenses. And so the increases here are all related to either support of additional revenue on pre-tax income or
the two things that Bryan and I discussed and we are continuing to focus very, very strongly on expense
discipline.

Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Hi, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just looking at the margin, I guess, the start and the growth in cash and with the expectation for additional cash
growth from the branch shield and the IBKC deal. How should we be thinking about sort of the deployment of that
cash into either securities or, I guess, securities or your expectation for customers' deposit use. So as we go
forward through the next few quarters, how should we be looking at that sort of net cash position?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So as I've said in my earlier comments, we think that initially in the third quarter, the addition of the net $2
billion of funding from Truist is going to depress the margin maybe in the mid-teens range. And over the next few
to several months, we're going to figure out ways to deploy that in terms of either securities, loan growth,
managing down other higher cost deposits, et cetera.
So, we expect that to be a temporary-type depression of the margin and so set a different way if the Truist
acquisition was not being completed in the quarter, we would think the margin would be relatively stable to just
down modestly, as opposed to down in the mid-teens because of the addition of the excess cash.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then can you talk a little bit about the deferral extension process, as that initial 90-day period
ends, how are you approaching extension there and do you expect to be able to get either additional credit
enhancements, or any type of beneficial term restructuring as those go forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Hi, Jared. Related to the deferrals, we are really getting to the end of the first round of 90-day deferrals requested
by our customers and we are really on a case-by-case basis with our commercial customers, asking questions
about other sources of cash and sponsor, guarantor support, et cetera. And oftentimes, we are getting some
additional whether it's a guarantee, asking a guarantor owner to put in more equity, potentially looking at other
structural elements.
At this point and we've had a deep portfolio review as BJ mentioned in his remarks on our slides with a number of
related to specific loans in a number of portfolios. In fact, we covered over 70% of some of the higher risk

portfolios. And we were talking with our bankers about what their clients were telling them. We don't – at this
point, we're not anticipating nearly the number of second round deferrals as we had in the first round. Really, only
in two real industry pockets do we expect potentially second round deferrals to be maybe near what they were in
first round and that would be some of the restaurant franchise, finance company, and some of our hotel
borrowers.
Otherwise based on feedback we've received over the last really 30 days to 45 days, we're not hearing of a big
increase. Obviously, we're watching that closely as things continue to be very dynamic around the COVID
situation related to various states. But many of our customers are reporting good liquidity, good cash reserves, a
combination of their operating at lower expenses, the benefits of the government programs including the PPP
program, the EIDL program, the CARES [ph] grant (00:38:43) programs. So again, we were glad – we're glad to
be able to assist customers during this time, but right now, the second round of deferrals appears to be a much
lighter request than we had on the first round.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
That's great color. Thanks. And then just finally for me on, as we look at going forward, if we do see additional
macro deterioration based on the Moody's models, should we assume that you're all are more willing to use
qualitative overlays with the additional credit protection from the MOE, or should we expect to see that the macro
impact from any future deterioration would be a similar impact?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
So actually, for the second quarter, and we did in the first quarter but even more in the second quarter, in addition
to the Moody's baseline, we actually did apply a good bit of qualitative overlay on a number of portfolios that either
or have the potential to have some effect from COVID. So as an example of some of the portfolios that where we
had an additional qualitative overlay included not for profits, senior living like nursing homes, assisted living,
health care, and then even a more significant qualitative on some other areas which you would expect things like
restaurants, entertainment, hospitality, retail.
And then in an energy, we took a very, very strong look and did a – a great deal of the clients there as we went
through borrowing-based redeterminations, looked at hedge strategies et cetera. And so we did deploy a good
qualitative overlay in the second quarter and will continue to do that as we evaluate CECL.
At this point, we feel like we're well reserved for the portfolios that we have, and we'll continue, obviously, to
evaluate that next quarter, I guess, for this quarter, third quarter, as we get near the end of the quarter. But we
feel like we've got a good robust process and have taken both, as I said, the Moody's process but then the subject
matter expertise and that qualitative overlay based on information we gained from the deep dives that we've had.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
And I would add to what Susan said that as we evaluated the loan marks, on the IBERIA portfolio, we did the
same thing. We used qualitative overlays, where we needed to, particularly, around stress sectors as Susan
outlined. So we feel like we had fulsome marks, and we have very healthy reserves on the First Horizon
standalone side.

D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
This is Bryan. It's an interesting time to be estimating loan loss reserves and we're all trying to figure out how
CECL works in the real world. And in many ways, it is – I'll stick with ill-timed and overly burdensome, but if you,
sort of, step back from the loan portfolios and you look at the various components, you're seeing some places
where there are trouble emerging and Susan did a good job in enumerating those places, but there's a disconnect
between, call it $17 million in net charge-offs and $540 million in round numbers of loan loss reserves.
And we fully expect what borrowers are doing today, that there are a lot of places that this economy can go, and
what happens if we have more shutdown or re-shutdown. What happens if the Congress and the administration
don't put together a fully helpful – another round of stimulus? What happens if their liquidity programs change?
Right now, the economy is doing better than you might think and borrowers are doing better than you might think,
given the economic environment we're in. We attribute a lot of that to the great work that the Treasury and the
Fed have done with programs like Main Street lending which has not really been used, but it implies liquidity
programs, PPP, the stimulus payments, consumers are still relatively strong, credit card volume has been picking
up since the economy started reopening.
So all-in-all, we've got a sober and cautious outlook on what happens over the remainder of the year but when
you talk to individual borrowers and you go through individual elements of the portfolio, things are doing much
better than you might expect at this point in time. And you take the restaurant business, if you're in the quick-
serve restaurant business, you're back to where you were pre-pandemic largely speaking and, in some cases,
your comps are up 10%, 20% depending on the business you're in. So it is a tale of many stories out there right
now, and it's just an odd time to be trying to flyspeck what loan loss reserves and life of loan losses might look
like.

Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Bryan, does it stay with the reserve conversation this being an odd time. Based on everything you're looking at,
now do you think the majority of the reserve building under CECL is now behind you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, clearly, from an accounting perspective, we take the information we have and we book what we think are life
of loan losses. And so, if the economy plays out consistent with that set of assumptions, yes, I think so, but as I
said earlier in talking about the dividend, we don't know what we don't know about how this virus plays out. It's a
medically-driven crisis and until we get a solution to that, it's hard to know how it plays through the economy. But I
think we have – based on all the information we have available to us, book sufficient reserves to cover losses in
the portfolio as it stands today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And as we get to the second half and some of these deferrals start transitioning into defaults, is it likely you'll then
need to establish a specific reserve or is the plan to start using these qualitative overlays that you're building into
the reserve today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, I think, clearly, that we built some of these reserves and the qualitative reserves in anticipation of specific
problem. So our intent would be to use those as they evolve, yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. And then shifting direction to fixed income, it was nice to see ADR above the prior range, it's
been a while. I'm curious how did ADR trend through the quarter and do you think it's sustainable at these levels?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. ADR trended positively throughout the quarter. We finished the quarter very strong and I would say a very
good start to the third quarter as well. We do think it is sustainable and some of it is, sort of, the extension of the
comments we made about loan growth to the extent macro loan growth is not good across the industry. There are
more opportunities for securities and securities portfolios and financial institutions and the question came up
about cash on balance sheet, that's happening across the industry, so that's good for the business.
The average daily revenue this quarter was impacted a little bit by the reversal of what we call negative splits in
the end of the first quarter being reversed. Another name would be portfolio gains or trading gains and losses that
occurred. But average daily revenue has looked good, the trends look good, and our outlook for the remainder of

the year is that our fixed income business will continue to serve as a – or the countercyclical buffer that we've
always believed it to be.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. It's nice to see some of the clouds begin to part here. Following on Steve's question, I do
worry about FHN securities because the performance has been so good, it's repeatedly beaten our expectations,
and wanted to just go back to your comments Bryan. And I mean, is this more of a kind of flat from here, sort of,
set up into the back half, which should still be very, very strong? Or do you think you could actually climb it out
from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
I think my outlook would be that you, sort of, – if you were going to forecast it out, you wouldn't show a lot of
growth and you wouldn't show a decline in a whole lot, it'd be sort of in the area of, sort of, the average of where
it's been in the last couple of quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And BJ, one of the areas where the clouds kind of remain is around the net interest margin. I know you've
taken a crack at defining that a bit, you've got PPP, you've got the branch sale or the branch purchase coming in,
as you look and as we can see, of course, it may be as you look at year end Q4. What kind of a core NIM should
we be looking at?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, yeah, by the way, I don't know why Bryan gets the good question on strong fixed income and I get the
tough question on NIM. So I would expect that the core NIM continues to be pressured through the back half of
the year. I mean that we've got hopefully loan yields stabilizing a bit. We still have some room as I talked about
earlier on deposits and deposit rates paid. We still think that we can bring those down. But the reality is we're
going to continue to have a high class problem of excess liquidity that we're going to have to work through.
So that's going to be the depression in the margin. I wouldn't translate that into material declines in overall NII,
because, we've got accretion coming through even if the margin is, it is compressed by excess liquidity, it goes
into excess balances at the Fed and that's largely a wash. So it's again continue – it's going to be challenged but
we've got opportunities to mitigate it, both in the net interest income line as well as what Bryan just talked about

the countercyclical businesses that we've got, a fixed income, loans to mortgage companies. And as a combined
company, the mortgage origination platform that IBERIA has, which had a record quarter in the first quarter and
then soundly beat that record quarter in the second quarter. So we have multiple levers that we think can offset
some of these headwinds and we work hard to mitigate as much as we can.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Just wanted to follow up on the NIM, BJ, you earlier mentioned that ex-Truist, we expect the NIM would be
relatively stable to going down modestly, so just wanted to put some numbers around to make sure we get this
correct. [indiscernible] (00:51:50) you expect the late teens declines, so let's call it about 2.70%, is that a decent
place when we reflect Truist, reflect IBERIA, we reflect PPP for now in terms of where the core NIM should be
around the 2.70% and then maybe it might have some upside as we deploy that liquidity, as PPP runs off or is
there a more downside to that core NIM relative to a 2.70% number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, I had said mid-teens and our core NIM is 2.80% in the quarter, and when I have been speaking about
what I thought second half of the year looked like, I'm obviously contemplating not just standalone, I'm

contemplating the IBERIA merger, the Truist acquisition, and you know the puts and takes of those. So, yeah, I
think it's mid-teens primarily from the liquidity, the excess liquidity that we will see from Truist.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Sorry [indiscernible] (00:52:59) and then what's your view on PPP running off, do you expect most of this to be
forgiven by the end of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yes. We do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yes. Got it. And would you have like what the pro forma earning assets or what the quarter-end earning asset
growth for both the balance sheets, just trying to get a sense of what we should expect in terms of the size of the
balance sheet looking out into 3Q with all these things added?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
The pro forma earnings assets at June 30th?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
So pro forma loans for both First Horizon and IBERIA together, if you look at [ph] 630 (00:53:51) without PPP is
about $55 billion. And I know you ask for all earning assets but I thought I'd go and give you the loans, obviously
that's without PPP. We had a combined PPP portfolio of about little over – about $4.1 billion. So if you include
PPP, total loans on a pro forma basis at the end of June are about $59 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I've got – Ebrahim, I've got earning asset at roughly $74 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Thanks. I got it. That's helpful. And just one separate question. So, I guess, for Susan, so you've talked a lot
about credit and what we've done in the uncertainty on the macro. At this point like when you look at the loan
portfolio, are you still making decisions based on portfolio level details as you mentioned in restaurant, finance
hotel? Or would you say you have a good handle on granularly looking at these loans customer by customer, I
think Bryan alluded to it. Just trying to get a sense of, is this still a model-based exercise or do you have a good
sense around and comfort around customers' ability to withstand, if things don't get materially worse, which would
imply a decent drop-off in terms of credit provisioning relative to what we've seen in the first half.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Right. So we – in addition to portfolio levels that we're looking at and we're looking at information loan-by-loan,
our bankers are updating loan by loan information based on customer feedback, we're also looking at a lot of
market information around what's going on with various franchises, in the franchise finance space, what's going
on with hotel, occupancies and ADRs but then again looking at that on a customer-by-customer basis, so we will
continue to do that.
Just as a reminder, we talked about this last quarter but we feel very good about the disciplined underwriting that
we've had since the last financial crisis. And I would say this applies to both legacy First Horizon and legacy
IBERIA as it relates two things like in the commercial real estate book, hospitality of average equities in the 40%
range and so it gives us a lot of cushion, our customers a lot of cushion when you have something unprecedented
like a COVID pandemic.
Maybe a data point that some customers saw this was when things were starting to open back up, Bryan alluded
to this on the restaurant side. We, clearly, sat on the restaurant side but also in the hotel portfolio because our
hotel portfolios tend to be smaller, driving distance type hotels that cater to family travel, some business travel.
We have very limited exposure to convention large hotel business. And we heard from clients that Memorial Day,
end of June through July 4, some of them had – were fully occupied.
We also saw, as Bryan said, average restaurant checks went up as more people did take out. They were buying
more than they would if they went in, and they were thinking about I might want some later. So we are seeing that
both in that market data that we get on all of our industries and study, but also talking with individual customers
about what they're seeing. So we will continue to look at both, but again I was also pleased with the resiliency that
I saw out of our clients when you have the complete shutdown and then things open back up. We saw dramatic
increases pretty quickly. But as Bryan and BJ said, we're also watching, there's some additional shutdowns that
have occurred, but again resilient customers, prudent underwriting, and so we believe we've got a reserve for
what our lifetime losses will be based on what we know today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
I'd add to the resiliency. Customers had been very creative in the way they've adapted to an unusual set of
circumstances and you see our customers adapting their business model to meet changing circumstances. And it
really is amazing, and if nothing else, it is a testament, an overall testament to the strength and creativity of the
economy in the US.

Understand. I guess, just bigger picture, I know the deal just closed but you sound very positive on its potential.
And clearly, the environment has changed though since you've announced the transaction. How would you recast
earnings power or advise thinking about the return potential for the combined company in this type of
environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, I think, the way I would characterize it is short-term, I think, we and everybody else are focused on safety
and soundness, right, healthy reserves, strong capital levels, strong liquidity and funding profiles. Beyond that, it's
controlling what we can control. And what we can control is, particularly, in this environment, our support of our
countercyclical businesses, our deposit pricing discipline, and a huge level, of course, for us is taking cost out of
our combined organization in a very material way over the next several quarters.
So I think those things will position us very well in terms of our ability to maintain profitability over the next several
quarters. Beyond that, we are very convicted and optimistic about the opportunity we have long term as a
combined organization. We've got the cost saves that will come in. We are in very attractive markets. We are
continuing to build a diversified business mix with countercyclical businesses. Our enhanced scale will help. So
over the medium and long term, we still feel like we can generate top tier profitability over the long term, and we're
building a company to position us well to do that.

Hey, Garrett. This is Bryan. Look, I think this is – it's hard to sort of model what was in the numbers in November
and what's in the numbers today because CECL changes everything. But as we talked about today, both
businesses are seeing strong PPNR, we're seeing very good activity in our franchise, we think that there is a
great deal of leverage.
In fact, we're seeing in the first couple weeks of merger – post-merger timeframe referrals of business that go into
our asset-based lending business. So we haven't modeled in any of the synergies but those synergies will be
there on the revenue side. The one thing I'm certain of is we have the ability to hit our commitments of $170

million plus, I think we have the opportunity to upsize that over time. And I can't understate how important a lever
that is in an environment like this. These are costs that we couldn't get at on an individual basis by combining the
two organizations in a no premium merger of equals. We have the ability to create $170 million pre-tax plus of run
rate savings on an annual basis that you can annuitize. And so that's a big deal and that will be a big driver over
the next 18 months.
So as BJ said, longer term, I think we're going to be in a position with the markets that we're in, with the bankers
that we have on the playing field, the team that's out there covering our customer base and our strength of
balance sheet, we're going to have superior growth opportunities. And in the short run, we're going to have levers
to pull with our countercyclical businesses and our cost savings that are going to be meaningful in terms of
creating shareholder value.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Good morning. Could you just talk about your criticized loan trend from sequentially and where you're seeing the
most increase? And then can you also talk about what you're expecting in terms of the near-term net charge-off
levels over the next six months, I know that they stayed quite low in the second quarter? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A

information on the combined basis as well. If you look at [Technical Difficulty] (01:04:20-01:04:25).

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
I'm going to answer the question. Yeah. So Jennifer asked about criticized loan changes. And so for First Horizon
standalone, we saw about $100 million added to criticized loans quarter-over-quarter. IBERIA added just under
$200 million, so we have about $290 million added quarter-over-quarter in the criticized loans, of which, about
$190 million was energy related across the two portfolios. I would say that both companies took a very
conservative approach as we look through our energy portfolios, and took the appropriate action we needed to
upgrading those.
So on a percentage basis of criticized loans, First Horizon's standalone went from about 2.8% of the portfolio to
3.5%. By the way, these numbers exclude PPP loans on the percentage of loans. And then on a combined basis,
again, pro forma end of the quarter, criticized loans were about 3.2% of the portfolio, up from about 2.4%, if you
look at it at the end of the first quarter.
So we did see some increase in criticized loans. Well, I don't have a specific forecast for net charge-offs, we are
obviously looking at some increase in the criticized loans. Based on what we know today in the economy, I would
expect that we would have the net charge-offs in the third and fourth quarter. At this point though, I don't really
have a forecast but there's a good bit of uncertainty. But as we mentioned earlier because of how CECL works,
we believe that we've got – we're well reserved for lifetime losses in the portfolio based on what we know today
and to complete really the deep dives that we get on the portfolio and specifically the higher risk portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. And I would say, just to add, Susan talked about it, the majority of the increase being energy and energy
being one of the near-term portfolios that we would obviously be most focused on our coverage of the combined
energy portfolio will be around 8%. So we significantly increased the reserves on those portfolios through both the
marks and on the standalone side. So you know that's one of the places that we have leaned in along with the
other sectors that Susan talked about earlier.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
So you guys gave us an update on the fixed income business but the mortgage warehouse unless I missed it
what's the outlook there. It seems like it could have lags given where mortgage rates are going and any color on
the split between refi and purchase as well as where yields are today?

Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
So mortgage warehouse, refi purchase is up 65% refi in the second quarter, which is kind of what you would
expect with rates, would you think those as their low points, go down again, so there's been some good activity
there. Yields in the second quarter were about [ph] 361 (01:08:18) for that mortgage warehouse portfolio. So as
we have over the last three years added customers through the customer account in mortgage warehouse but I'll
let BJ talk maybe about the outlook for this warehouse.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Yes. Casey I think as you remember in the first quarter, we had a very significant run up in the last five weeks of
the quarter and period-end balances top ticked at around $5.8 billion. They stayed pretty elevated because of
strong activity through the quarter and you saw our average balance is actually up pretty materially and loans to
mortgage companies first to second, the period end balances were down more in the $4 billion range right.
So the business does ebb and flow based on the flow of mortgage originations and the mix of purchase and refi.
Going into the third quarter, we see continued strength in the business and so we expect it to grow from the
period-end balances of $4 billion and likely be in the range of the average balances that we saw in the second
quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thank you. Bryan, just big picture question for you, when you guys announced this deal in early
November, obviously it was a much, much different world. Things seem to be tracking at least from a capital
perspective and cost save perspective plans. But is there anything strategically, either on the First Horizon or the
IBERIA side of the house, a loan vertical or [indiscernible] (01:10:13) portfolio strategy change that you guys are
thinking about, just given how different the world is today versus November?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, there are not any significant changes. No, we're still equally convicted about merits of the transaction. And I
am extraordinarily pleased with the way the team has come together. It has been remarkable and while we had
the first four months to bring people together in a face-to-face environment, since March, we've been doing it via
Webex and Zoom and all the other electronic virtual means that you can come up with, but the team has come
together and doing very, very well.
And as I mentioned, we're seeing some opportunities to leverage portfolios or businesses across both
organizations. I mentioned ABL, BJ mentioned the mortgage business and the title business that IBERIABANK
brings to the table, so we still see a lot of that. We'll fine tune some things, one is that if you look closely at the
numbers you'll see, for example, the commitments in energy were down a little bit this quarter. It represents on a
combined basis about 4% of the portfolio.
So we're willing to trim our sales as the economy continues to adjust to the pandemic and then the post pandemic
world. But on a macro basis, we're still equally convicted about the opportunities of bringing these two
organizations together. And I'm glad we're beyond the starting line and the hard work is in place. So it's an
exciting time to get that done. And I think as I said earlier, we're going to see a lot of shareholder value created
when we combine these two companies over the next 18 months.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
[indiscernible] (01:12:21) good morning. How are you? Just wanted to focus on the branch acquisition and sort of
strategically, Bryan, does that – do you look at it any differently than you did last fall, just given where we are and
also the high liquidity that BJ had addressed earlier?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, I think you raised an accounting and an economic point that excess deposits today are sort of different in a
zero rate environment. But from a strategic standpoint, I think it is a home run transaction for us and we're very,
very pleased with that transaction. As BJ mentioned earlier that conversion and acquisition is going on this
weekend. So those customers and those branches will be converted over the weekend.
And what it will do is, overnight, we'll do 30 years of branch building in the Carolinas in terms of average branches
with, call it, $80 million in deposits and give us meaningful share in the middle part in North Carolina. And back to
what we said in 2017 when we merged with Capital Bank, it was, we wanted to have a meaningful presence in the
Carolinas and to pick up a top five presence in the triangle – in the Triad area, Greensboro Winston-Salem, High
Point and to pick up meaningful share in Durham and Chapel Hill, the Triangle area in North Carolina is
significant. And from a strategic standpoint, if we started building these 30 branches, we couldn't create branches
of this quality in 20, 25 years. This is just a quality franchise and we were lucky to partner with SunTrust, BB&T
and now Truist that acquire these branches. So we're proud of what we're building in Virginia, Carolinas, and
Georgia with this transaction.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks. Thanks for that. And I guess, when you have the systems fully converted, you can do more
with those branches too, right. So we can stop thinking about it in that context?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Oh, yeah. Absolutely but the systems will be converted Sunday morning. So everything will be done this
weekend. So it's soup to nuts this weekend on a branch acquisition. So we'll hit the ground running and people
have worked really, really hard over the last few months. And it's one of the reasons we deferred. We wanted to
be in a position to do adequate customer communication, adequate training. We've got ambassadors in all of
these banking centers from the First Horizon perspective, who will be helping with systems and technology and

things like that over the next couple of weeks. But we're going to hit the ground running in these branches,
financial centers, banking centers, who will be part of the First Horizon franchise this weekend and we'll hit the
ground running Monday morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
It really does help, I mean, obviously having additional banking centers improves our ability not only to reach
additional consumers but small businesses in middle market companies still like to see a branch presence. And
so it enhances the work that our bankers have already done and calling on and bringing in business from all the
areas where we'll have expanded presence and in a few situations, presence that we didn't have before. So, we
look forward to that in addition to serving consumers, but also the business side.
