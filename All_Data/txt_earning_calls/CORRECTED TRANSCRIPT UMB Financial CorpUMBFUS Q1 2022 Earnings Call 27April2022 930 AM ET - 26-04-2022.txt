Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kay, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. 2022 is off to a great start. Solid performance in the
first quarter included 19.1% linked quarter annualized growth in average loans, and we posted a $6.5 million
provision release reflecting the quality of our loan portfolio. Additionally, we had strong fee income combined with
expense levels that moderated from the previous quarter.
For the first quarter, net income was $106 million or $2.17 per share. Pre-tax pre-provision income on an FTE
basis was $125.7 million or $2.57 per share. First quarter net interest income was relatively flat on a linked
quarter basis. The positive impact from asset growth and balance sheet moves we made was offset by the sale of
our factoring portfolio and the continued runoff of PPP balances, along with fewer days in the quarter. Noninterest
income for the quarter totaled $123.7 million, an increase of 4.1% compared to the fourth quarter. Ram will share
more detail on the various drivers, but we saw positives across many of our fee businesses highlighted in the line
of business update in our presentation.
In the current economic and regulatory environment, there are a few items that position us well from a fee income
perspective. First, we don't rely on mortgage gain on sale income, which is likely to be a drag for some of our
peers heading into a rising rate environment.
Second, NSF and OD fees are a very small portion of our deposit service charges and represent well less than
1% of total revenue. And, while early, we've begun to see a return of 12b-1 fees as interest rates rise. For the full
year 2019, brokerage income where those fees are booked, was $31.3 million. As rates fell in subsequent years,
that total dropped to just $12.2 million in 2021. A normalization of that income stream is a tailwind for us.
Total noninterest expense fell 3.5% on a linked quarter basis, as some of the higher than typical expenses we
discussed in the fourth quarter has moderated. Excluding contributions from PPP, we generated positive
operating leverage in the first quarter of 2022, a 6.2% on a linked quarter basis and 7.8% versus first quarter of
last year.
Moving to the balance sheet, slide 24 is a snapshot of our loan portfolio showing the drivers behind loan growth I
mentioned. Average loans for the first quarter, excluding PPP balances, increased 15.6% year-over-year and
more than 19% on a linked quarter annualized basis. We saw phenomenal growth in C&I balances with balances
increasing 35% on a linked quarter annualized basis.
Commercial real estate loan demand is strong, particularly in industrial projects, although developers are closely
monitoring the cost of materials and labor. Most of our year-to-date activity in real estate has been in our Salt
Lake City, Kansas City, Denver and St. Louis markets.
Average residential mortgage balances grew 4.4% from the fourth quarter to just over $2 billion. As I mentioned,
we don't rely heavily on mortgage gain on sale revenue. However, we continue to grow our own portfolio and
recently implemented a new down payment assistance program. The program, launched in December of 2021, is
geared towards underserved markets and it had 47 new applicants just in the first quarter.
Total top line loan production, as shown on slide 25, was again very strong coming in at $1.1 billion for the
quarter. Payoffs and paydowns were 5.1% of loans, in line with recent quarters. While estimating payoffs can be
unpredictable, we continue to see opportunities across all verticals in the second quarter. Based on what we see
now, gross loan production is likely to be stronger than the first quarter.

Asset quality, as shown on slide 26 and 27, remain strong with net charge-offs of 20 basis points for the first
quarter, consistent with our outlook and our historical averages. We did see an increase in nonaccruals from the
fourth quarter levels which is largely driven by one relationship. At this time, we feel like we're in a good position
there and expect a favorable resolution in the coming weeks. As we head into this cycle, I look back on prior
periods and how our credit metrics have performed. The real test of quality comes when conditions are negative.
Back to the balance sheet, strong deposit growth continued in the quarter with average balances increasing
nearly 12% on a linked quarter annualized basis. Despite our strong loan growth, our average loan-to-deposit
ratio remains low at just 53% for the first quarter. This provides us with flexibility in a raising rate environment. We
have plenty of opportunity to fund growth potential we see in our pipeline.
Yesterday, our board approved the quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share and renewed the standard annual 2
million share repurchase authorization. These remain important in our toolkit for capital deployment in addition to
our opportunistic M&A.
Finally, our latest Corporate Citizen Report has just been published and is available on our website. It highlights
our continued efforts and actions related to environmental, social and corporate governance issues. Our strong
first quarter results position us well for the rest of the year and we are encouraged by the activity we've seen so
far in the second quarter.
Now, I'll turn it over to Ram. Ram?

Ram Shankar
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Mariner. Net interest income was relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter at $210.4 million. The
impact of the $1.2 billion in average earning asset growth was offset by the $4 million reduction in PPP income
and fewer days in the quarter. We amortized $1.7 million of PPP origination fees into income and the overall PPP
contribution to the first quarter net interest income was just under $2 million compared to $6 million last quarter
and $13.4 million in the first quarter of 2021.
At quarter-end, our PPP balances stood at $77.2 million, down from $136.5 million at December 31.
Approximately $2 million in unamortized fees remain. Average earning asset yields decreased 2 basis points to
2.47% with loan yields impacted by the sale of the factoring book and the $118 million decline in average PPP
balances.
As shown on slide 21, our Fed account, reverse repo and cash balances moderated slightly and now comprised
18% of average earning assets with a blended yield of 30 basis points compared to 26 basis points in the fourth
quarter, as this shows liquidity balances still remain elevated from pre-pandemic levels. The 3% increase in
average deposits from the fourth quarter was driven by growth in DDA balances, and the total cost of deposits
including free funds remained at 8 basis points.
First quarter net interest margin fell 2 basis points from the fourth quarter to 2.35%, driven largely by changes in
loan mix, offset by positive impacts from changes in the AFS book, the decline in liquidity levels and number of
days in the quarter. We've added slide 30 in our deck to show the estimated impact of net interest income in
various rate scenarios. In a rate ramp scenario of plus 100 basis points on a static balance sheet, net interest
income is predicted to rise 1.7% in year 1 and 7.5% in year 2.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2022
On the asset side, 56% or about $9.7 billion of average loans are variable rates, and of those, 63% reprice within
12 months. They are tied to short-term rates with just under 60% tied to LIBOR. Additionally, the securities
portfolio is expected to generate nearly $1 billion of cash flow in the next 12 months, available to be reinvested at
higher rates. Notwithstanding our strong loan growth, our securities portfolio has continued to grow. And, as we
indicated in our press release, we transferred securities with a fair value of $2.9 billion from the AFS to HTM book
in March to help manage tangible capital and reduce the impact of rising rates on our equity. At March 31, 34% of
our securities portfolio was classified as held to maturity.
As expected, the rate environment drove changes in AOCI, which declined by $469 million from year-end.
Although fluctuations in AOCI don't affect earnings, we're mindful of the impact on tangible book value and will
continue to evaluate potential opportunities to mitigate that impact.
As you've heard us say before, we run our business by focusing on regulatory capital ratios which remain strong
with total risk-based capital at 13.55%, CET 1 at 11.81%, and leverage ratio at 7.53%.
Back to the income statement, non-interest income for the first quarter was $123.7 million, an increase of $4.9
million from the fourth quarter. Deposit service charges increased $3 million and included a $3.5 million increase
in client transfer and conversion fees in our healthcare business.
As Mariner mentioned, NSF/OD fees included in this line represent less than 1% of our total revenue and came in
at just $1.4 million for the first quarter. Derivative income increased $1.9 million from the prior quarter and
company-owned life insurance income increased $823,000 on a linked quarter basis. Both are included in the
other income line, and the COLI income has a similar offset in deferred compensation expense. Other drivers to
fee income including the $2.4 million gain on the sale of our factoring business and reduced investment security
gains are shown on slide 22.
Noninterest expense trends are shown on slide 23. A $7.7 million linked quarter decrease was driven by
reductions from the elevated fourth quarter levels in variable costs such as incentive compensation and lower
legal consulting and marketing costs. These were partially offset by the typical seasonal reset of payroll taxes, the
increased deferred compensation I mentioned, and higher bankcard expense.
Our effective tax rate was 15.7% for the first quarter. For the full year 2022, we anticipate it will approximate 17%
to 19%. That concludes our prepared remarks, and now, I'll turn it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion
of the call.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo.
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Timur Braziler filling in for Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Hey, Timur.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Starting – hey, guys, maybe just starting on the funding outlook. So, clearly with a 53% loan-to-deposit ratio, you
guys have options. I'm just wondering, as you look at the loan pipeline on the optimism that remains there, how
are you thinking about funding that growth in a rising rate environment? Are you going to primarily keep utilizing
cash to help fund that growth, going to utilize some of those securities, cash flows, or is there an expectation that
period end or end of period deposit balances will ramp higher as the year goes on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. Thanks for the question. I'd say we've got, obviously with the loan-to-deposit ratio and the shortness of our
investment book and what we keep at the window, we've got lots of flexibility to fund the growth and we can kind
of tap what we need to tap.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And, I guess, as you think about the deposit book and rising rates and deposit betas, is that going to be a
driver of keeping betas lower for longer? How are you thinking about deposit betas in a rising rate environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, Ram, you can take that. I mean, high level, we're – we've shocked that. We've analyzed in some ways to
Sunday, some level we are just going to have to monitor it and a lot of what happens to deposit betas will have to
do with what the three or four largest banks do with their deposit rates and we'll have to follow them. We have
some index funds. About 25% of them are hard indexed, and that's going to do what it will do. So, deposit betas
are something that we'll just be monitoring. We have a history of being just around 50% on the deposit betas.
We'll see where all that ends up.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2022
Yes. Just from a modeling perspective, Timur, we do assume like a similar deposit beta experience this last time.
So, – but, certainly, given the 53% loan-to-deposit ratio in the securities cash flow, there is a lot more flexibility on
the soft index than the non-index deposits for us to be a little bit more disciplined about it. So, certainly, that would
be a part of our thinking for 2022 and 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, Ram, I saw in the deck that the reinvestment yields in the first quarter were still kind of high 1%.
I'm just wondering what are you seeing today for reinvestments out of the bond book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. It's about 70 basis points higher than where the roll-offs are going to be. So, if you look at one of our slides,
for the next 12 months, we expect roll-offs to be under 2%. And, based on where the two-year and the five-year
are today, our yields are closer to 2.65% to 2.70%. So, there is a nice pickup assuming this stays the way it is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just last for me, nice to see continued line usage ticking up in the commercial book. I'm just
wondering is there any particular industry that you're seeing incremental optimism or much of that line usage
coming from, and, are we pretty close to a level of stability there or is the expectation that line utilization continues
to ramp higher through the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
We've got Tom Terry with us. Let Tom take that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. It's a good question. The utilization really has been across the board. Our C&I business has been very
strong. So, there is not one particular industry to look at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks for the questions.

Ram Shankar A

Morning, Nathan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Question just on the rate sensitivity. I appreciate the disclosures on slide 30. And, I think Mariner just mentioned
that about 25% of the deposit base is hard or soft indexed. I believe, Ram you threw out a number of close to
30% in the quarter. So, just want to confirm that, and if the 100% beta on those deposits is contemplated in the
interest rate sensitivity and I agree that you guys disclosed on slide 30.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. So, the hard index, Mariner mentioned, is about 28%. There is another 7% that's soft indexed. So, the hard
index one is formulaic and it's not a 100% beta. It doesn't mean that for every 25 basis points decline gets 25%. It
could be anywhere from 50% to 80% of that. So, it's not always 100% beta. The 7%, the soft index, is where we
have a lot of flexibility. We do it on a case by case basis as opposed to adjusting market rates. And, that is
contemplated in our projections on slide 30.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. And then, just thinking about the securities portfolio balance on an absolute basis, you had some
growth in this quarter. So, just curious what the appetite is to continue to grow the securities book on an absolute
dollar basis from here going forward versus maybe just allowing the cash that's on the balance sheet just to
reprice higher as that rate – increases rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. Our open strategy is to continue to increase the size of our securities book. So, what is understated in the
period end balances for investment securities, as I talked about in my prepared comments is, we add about $450
million of market value decline because of what happened with rates. So, each month, we talk about in our Asset
Liability Committee about reinvesting cash flows based on the current conditions. And, last few months and we'll
probably continue this, we'll also do some over buys with expected cash flows either from deposit flows or just the
cash on the balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And, we're keeping pretty short. So, that's the other part of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
And, yes, if you look at our AFS portfolio, the duration swap, adjusted duration is 52 months. The nice thing in the
last 90 days is the two-year part of the curve has – as you see, has increased about 150 basis points. So, we're
keeping some of our cash flows. 40% of our cash flow is invested on the two-year part of the curve, two to three-
year part of the curve. So, we're managing duration in the context of extension risk that's going to happen to all of
us, given where our rates are headed.

than the first quarter. So, that'll top up some of that also.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Just maybe turning to fees, just maybe first one clarifying question, the $3 million in healthcare solutions is
conversion costs, is that more kind of one-time in nature? Is that more of a seasonal item that impacts, would be
resolved each quarter?

grow for them – talking about the growth -

James D. Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. The growth on the book, that was by design that those were going to go away. On the book that we have,
the growth has been 12% year-over-year, and the card spend has been up 8% year-over-year as well, without
those relationships.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Understood, very helpful. Also on fees, as we look out over the next few quarters, curious where you guys see a
lot of the growth opportunities. Obviously, fund services and the corporate trust and institutional asset
management remain bright spots across the various fee income lines. So, just curious if you expect those two

lines in particular to be kind of primary drivers for overall fee income growth this quarter -- or I'm sorry, going
forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. That's -- those are areas we are very excited about. The backdrop for continued expansion and growth
continue to be great for both of those specific businesses you brought, corporate trust and fund services. And the
comments that I've been making in the past would be similar and so I'm about to make, which is the backdrop for
fund services, in particular, are twofold. One, what's happened in the public markets has really driven a lot of
success in the private markets. And our business is really heavily weighted towards being a fund services
provider for the private equity, hedge fund, REIT, real estate, markets where there is an enormous amount of
strength from an investor community perspective. We're positioned very well in that space as one of the leaders.
And the second piece is with the disruption, the activity from private equity firms in the space has created a lot of
disruption in the sector. And that has created an outsized opportunity for us within the space. And so, that
continues to be the case. We're very excited. You see the numbers.
On a linked-quarter basis, the numbers are downside. That's just market activity. Number of accounts is up. And
we continue to really -- on a year-over-year basis, it's about a little over $100 billion in assets under
administration. So, trends continue to be great there.
Corporate trust is a fantastic story, a bit of a latent earnings story. We continue to see the activity. But as we
talked about 12b-1 fees and also the eventual accelerated spending from state and federal government as we talk
about building bridges, highways, sewer districts et cetera, on a national basis, we stand poised to be the main
player. Certainly, in our footprint and with our offices in New York and Dallas, we continue to pick up now share
on -- in the coastal markets where the dollar volumes are larger.
So, we played heavily for years as number 3 player on a number of issues. But we're now number 3 on volume
because we're playing in the coastal space where the deals are larger. So, if you take a water district deal in
Illinois or Iowa or something, that's going to be a couple of hundred million. You do a water district deal in New
York and talking billions. So, that's the trend in that business, along with our aviation business, which has been
sliding sideways because of the pandemic, and we're starting to see that unleash as people are traveling again,
transactions are picking up again.
And so, we're super excited about what's going on in both of those businesses. I'd say, all the institutional
businesses have great profiles right now across the board. Our -- as Jim just mentioned, what the trends are now
for our health care business, those are nice go-forward trends. The investor solutions business, as all of our
clients grow their clients, we grow our business. And then, what isn't institutional, which is our wealth business,
we've seen really good trends for new business in wealth. So, we're pretty pumped about the trends for all of our
fee businesses and excited about what lies ahead. I don't know if you want to add anything, Jim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James D. Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, UMB Financial Corp.
I would just add, fund services, there is a crossover to the commercial division with the liquidity lines we provide
for those funds. So, commercial has been able to provide referrals over to fund services. Additionally, in the more
traditional lines, integrated payables is one of the – really one of the best ways we can increase commercial fee
income too. That has been a great product for us, producing 7-figure fees for first quarter as far as with the tail to
them and the backlog is very strong. So, -

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
That's great color. If I could just ask one more on investor solutions in particular. I noticed that you guys written
that in the deck banking-as-a-service solution. So, I'm not sure if that implies kind of any shift in your strategy
within that line or kind of how you guys are thinking about the opportunities. Obviously, it's a term we hear
increasingly among banks these days. They want to provide more depository services on the like to nonbank
entities. So, I was just curious if there is kind of an update along those lines and kind of how you think about the
opportunities going forward within that in particular?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, I'm not sure -- yes, I'm not sure exactly. I mean banking-as-a-service is what that business is. I mean, that's
what we've been doing. So, it's just providing -- so the historical part of that business has been wirehouses,
brokerage firms. And that's the mature part of the business. And we have seen a lot of growth, as you see in our
deck, with some of the fintechs that are wanting to provide banking services for their customers. We are a premier
provider for them as well to white label, our banking products to and through their customers as well. I don't know
if that answers your question, but that is the business is white labeling our banking products for broker dealers,
wirehouses and fintechs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Right. No, I understand that. The approach to that business isn't really changeable. I'm not sure if there's any kind
of shift in strategy going forward in terms of maybe working with some other entities outside the historical
wirehouses and fintechs historically, but I appreciate that color, Mariner.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. No, I think that's the path. I mean, the new path is the fintechs. So, as they create new ideas, the new
companies come up through the pipeline that we would be ready. As kind of a premier provider in the space,
we're a go-to player for folks with new ideas.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
We've continued to build out APIs to make it easier to access our systems. But as far as the shift in strategy, we
have not shifted that strategy.

Good morning, Chris.

Ram, I want to make sure I got the color on the 12b-1 fees. Could you just repeat the -- I think you said it was $12
million last year. Can you remember -- remind us whether it was precut? And also, how we should just be thinking
about the correlation between revenues and rates? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. So, in 2019, before the Fed cut rates by 150 points on the onset of COVID, our run rate for that line item was
$31 million. So, $31 million dropped to $12 million. And the point that we also make is, back in 2019, the $31
million was based on a book that was significantly smaller than what it is today. So, the potential for revenue with
interest rates being hiked the way they are is pretty significant on that line item for us. And we haven't given
specifics about the beta on that. There is a lag usually, typically between when the rate goes up and when we get
to see the benefit of that. But it should be a nice tailwind for us to hit in 2023 and 2024, if the future rates are
where we're going to be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And rates have been rising sooner than we anticipated. So, that lags shorter, so. But I would also just add, as
Ram mentioned, related to the old book and the new book of business. One example, a pretty decent size
example would be that back in '19 our aviation trust business would have been very nascent. And so, the
business -- that is one particular example. You've got all the growth we've had in aviation trust and will have an
aviation trust, corporate trust that will benefit from 12b-1 fees.

Okay. And -- so, would those revenues pick up this year, if you believe the forward curve? Is that -- and then
where exactly in the fee income line would that be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
It will be the brokerage and insurance line, and we expect to see some benefits starting the second quarter based
on what transpired in March.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
The other question I had relates to the indexed deposits that you referenced, the 20 -- kind of heard index. Could
you just remind us where -- certainly, you don't need the deposits from a liquidity perspective. Can you just remind
us where the other benefits to having these deposits lie? Like, where else in the full relationship do you realize the
benefit for these higher beta deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, I mean -- so I mean, broadly speaking, obviously, deposits are raw material, and we're willing to take the
pain and pressure for building our business for the long term. I think, you're asking specifically about some of the
hard indexed money and why we take it. And that would be like, for example, that would be an example would be
a government -- piece of government business that would come with treasury, would come with lockbox, would
come with bond issuance opportunities, et cetera.
So, you can't look at it at our deposits in a singular vertical. You got to look at the overall profitability. And we do
that, right? So, we'll move off something if the overall profitability isn't good. But we'll take on some index or higher
beta deposits because of the overall relationship that comes with lending, treasury, bond issuance fees, et cetera.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yes. That's what I was looking for. Thanks very much.

Yes, car service income. You name it...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. I guess, the final question I had would be we've seen so much liquidity flow into the system, and we're all --
as analysts trying to figure out what will stay and what will not. Are there any pockets of your deposit base that
you're particularly worried about given the growth over the last 24 months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Sorry. We have a little technical -- can you repeat that?

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yes, no problem. I guess, the risk of deposit, parked money from -- with the Fed unwinding the balance sheet.
Your deposit growth has been great as of a lot of banks. I'm just wondering if you've done any analysis to say,
hey, is there any more chunky deposits that might be at risk of flight.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I mean, we -- if you look at the pre- and post-pandemic volumes, we are up about $4.5 billion. We debate
internally a lot, how much of that $4.5 billion is excess and how much of that is based on new customer growth,
customer success, et cetera, just the growth of our business. And we all have different answers to that internally.
And I think what you're describing is really that dialogue, the whole country is having about what -- how much of
this is excess liquidity. I'm not sure that we want to claim to be any experts on that. We're watching it closely.
Ram, do you want to add to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. No, we do alternative scenarios on the interest rate modeling for precisely that surge deposits, right? So, if
you just go back to history, during the last rate cycle, just before the Fed started cutting rates, our DDA balances
were like close to 43% of our total deposits and what happened as the cycle transpired was it came down to 35%,
right? So, we are assuming some kind of disintermediation from DDAs to money market or other types of
deposits. So, that's all built into our alternative scenario beta assumptions. So, we do expect some of that to
transpire where our DDAs are not going to be always at 45% because of the interest rate cycles.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
But where that lands...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Where that land is anybody's guess, and where the DARP [ph] lies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
There is -- I mean, the good news for us is sitting at 50% loan-to-deposit ratio is whether $1 billion goes into other
products or off-balance sheet or $2 billion, we still have an enormous amount of room to run up loan growth and
feel very safe and sound about our liquidity and our loan-to-deposit ratio.

Good morning, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. I wanted to dig a little deeper into the drivers on your C&I growth, and your expectations
and your pipeline there. Is it driven by the PPP relationships that you gain? Is it just traditional market share gains,
obviously utilization? Have you been hiring veteran bankers within your footprint? Can you just talk about how
some of those are impacting that growth and what really the core drivers are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James D. Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, this is Jim Rine. It's a really been the same story, we've been telling the last several quarters, and it's been
the market penetration. It's coming really from all regions. And we are under penetrated in every market, except
Kansas City. And markets whether it be, St. Louis, Dallas, Phoenix, Colorado, there hasn't been one particular
industry. We are hiring the right talent. They are calling on the right types of companies. Said before, we have a
compelling story. We are able to turn things around quickly. We are competitive on rates, et cetera, et cetera. So,
it's -- we target the right types of companies that we want to do business with. And then, we're able to retain the
top talent that we need in order to handle clients to grow the business. So, it's been our formula and it's been
really what's made us successful for many years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
You can't turn on C&I overnight. So, when your mortgage business dries up and you want to turn on your C&I
business, which some talk about, it doesn't happen overnight, unless you're taking on stuff you shouldn't be taking
on. So, it's just -- it's a long, long calling cycle with people that have been around a long time, takes -- we've been
building this business for 109 years and the pipeline is built as such. So, it takes a lot of things to get to where we
are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James D. Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, UMB Financial Corp.
But we're not doing things we haven't done. We're doing more of what we do, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. Couple of areas, I think, that are benefiting right now, the energy sector is pretty strong. And so, we've had
some nice benefit in the energy sector. There's a nice rebound in agribusiness with commodity prices. And so,
we're seeing some nice activity there. Industrial on the CRE side continues to be very strong. Companies build
inventories on a national basis for same-day, last-mile distribution. And there's -- depending on the market,
particularly in our marketplace, which is in Mountain Midwest, there's a shortage of housing. So, the multifamily
15

continues to be strong. So, while Jim says, it's across all areas, those are some areas that are outperforming and
see some pretty strong directional trends.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. No, that's appreciated. Good color. And then, the -- on the competitive side, how is the competition
impacting spreads in the commercial side of the business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
It's always robust. And I don't know if there's anything else to say. It's always -- we go after the best business out
there, and everybody wants the best business, and it's always competitive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James D. Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, UMB Financial Corp.
So, the pricing is always competitive in this rising rate environment, people are willing to lock things in for a longer
periods of time. And so, we're doing what we're comfortable with. But, when you see a 10-year, the request for
the 10-year fixed rates, we would want to have those swaps versus fixing those on balance sheet. And so, you
see some people stretching right now, and we're not willing to do that. But, outside of a few folks reaching, it's as
competitive as it's ever been.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
You might see some continued back-to-back swap income for us over the next handful of quarters grow because
of what Jim just mentioned, which is as customers look to lock rates, we'll be increasing our swap fees.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

I might just add, on slide 21, for those of you who are interested in this excess liquidity, and we talked about that. I
think that we have a slide in the bottom right quadrant of slide 21 in our deck. I'd point to you there. It's a really --
it's a new little chart we put in place. It's very helpful, I think, to thinking about what's happened to excess liquidity
and where you find it on our balance sheet and likely others' balance sheets. I'd point you there.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2022
Just curious on how we should think about the trajectory of the reserve? It doesn't sound like charge-offs are likely
to deviate from the historical ranges that you guys have talked about in the past. So, just I'm curious if we can
expect the reserve to kind of hold around 1% over the next few quarters, or do you guys expect to build just given
at least high-single-digit loan growth expectations going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thanks. That's a great question. It's another one of those sort of million-dollar questions. Right now, I think if you
think about all of us staring at this uncertain forward-looking environment, whether it's recessionary or not or how
deep the recession might be, et cetera.
I'll do a little bit of a soapbox here for us. A guy who's been a CEO for 18 years and watched this happen a few
times, it seems as though pre-CECL, we all, as an industry, seem to draw down our reserves towards the end of
the cycle, so that we had less reserves at the end of the cycle, which is always a big mistake and has been a
historic repeated deal for our industry.
We have always pushed against that. And CECL has caused that to be a lot more of an algorithm, a lot less
optionality to how it works. And we've got to be -- it's very math-driven based on, in our case, Moody's. So, what
Moody's said is a big part of their forward-looking projections has a lot to do with how we have to set our reserves.
I am kind of concerned at the industry level that you hear a lot of banks bragging about what their charge-off rates
are. And I'm not sure it's much to brag about when everything is perfect. That's your charge-off rates are perfect.
It's really what matters about your charge-off rate is what they look like when times tough, not when they're good.
And so, I'm a little concerned at the industry level that we're seeing it again, that we're drawing down our
reserves.
So, that's a little bit of kind of philosophical statement I'd make just as it relates specifically to us. I -- we are -- I'm
concerned about what late this year and next year looks like, as it relates to the economy. I'm not worried about
our charge-offs or our performance necessarily. But, I think, the desire would be to hold -- you asked where they
should be. My desire would be that they should hold around where they are. And that's my hope that using CECL
now that our friends at Moody's will also project that there's slightly higher unemployment and some weaken
economic conditions that will allow us to hold our reserve around where it is.
So, I don't know if that's helpful. We have a lot of boxes when it comes to what our reserves look like. And so, my
hope is that our friends at Moody's do the right things and see the right things, and we can keep our reserves
around where they are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. Until that happens, Nate, as you know, a lot of our provision comes for loan growth. So, we see a lot of
organic loan growth, and that's what's driving our provision expense. But clearly, with the Moody's variables,
economic forecast becoming more and more favorable each subsequent quarter, the pressure on allowance ratio
to come down is there, right? So, if you look at what our day 1 CECL allowance was, it was 85 basis points.
And I echo what Mariner said, is we get back to 85 basis points, but this is not the right time to get there. But that
said, the quantitative part of the model is what it is, right? We use Moody's forecast, and we have to wait until
Moody's changes their forecast in anticipation of any economic conditions. So, at this point, it's hard to say. That's
a million-dollar question really.

Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. The good news about us, though, is we have a very, very long track record of having industry-leading
charge-offs, that being low charge-offs, right? So, we don't expect our performance to be any different than it's
been the last 20 years, regardless of what the environment is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yes. Got it. That's helpful. And I fully appreciate it's difficult to predict under the CECL framework, particularly with
all the uncertainty that exists out there. Perhaps maybe just one last one on capital. Obviously, TCE came down
with the AOCI swing this quarter. So, just curious to get an update just in terms of the buyback appetite.
Obviously, the stock has been under pressure over the last few months like a lot of your peers. So, just curious
how you guys are thinking about the appetite for buybacks over the near term? And then, also just any update just
in terms of what you're seeing from an acquisition opportunity perspective these days?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. So obviously, capital deployment as a broad statement, the first thing we want to do is invest in our
business, so loan growth, hiring people, et cetera. That's where our money is going to go, making sure our
technology is fresh. Second to that would be M&A type activity. And the same comments we've always made is
that we continue to look for companies that fit both, culturally and then add value that are accretive and add value
to what we're doing long term. And then lastly, you -- we always want to perform well enough to be able to
increase our dividend every year. And that is our goal is to be able to have the performance to allow us to
continue to be one of the highest performers in the country as it relates to consistency of approach with our
dividend.
And then lastly, would be by opportunistic buybacks, just keeping an eye on the market. So it's the last on the list.
We've demonstrated that we do it. We've done it in the past at the right time, and we'll continue to look at it and
see if the -- if all of those other things are not available to us at the time in which we believe the price is right, we
will be buyers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. The only thing I'd add is if you look at the period-end share count, we did have 200,000 shares bought back
early on in the first quarter. So, to Mariner's point, we will be opportunistic about buybacks. And then, I'll just echo
my comments from the script, which is even though TCE has gown down, it's -- what we focus on is more of the
risk-based regulatory capital ratios. That's what we base our capital decisions on. So, that -- even though TCE
temporarily might be impacted, based on what's happening with interest rates, our focus for running the business
is primarily the risk-based capital ratios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. And if I could just actually ask one more on just the expense outlook. It seems like the salary line
was seasonally impacted by the payroll impacts and so forth in the first quarter. So just Ram, maybe any thoughts
on just directionally how expenses trend into the second quarter and just kind of overall expense growth
expectations for 2022?

Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. Without giving specific guidance, so a lot of puts and takes from where our first quarter levels are. Generally,
the $214 million that you see is a good jump-off point. Obviously, as you mentioned, there's a lot of FICA and
payroll expenses that spiked in the first quarter, especially with our bonus payments, and so that should moderate
a little bit. But then, the first quarter also had two less days -- or one less day compared to the second quarter. So,
that should probably go the other way. And then, in April, our normal merit cycle kicks into effect. So, that will
have some wage inflation and that salary numbers. But generally speaking, I would say $214 million is a good
jump-off point for the remainder of this year.

Hey, guys. Timur here with two more follow-up questions. Just maybe for, Ram, looking at the kind of the variable
rate loans, what portion of that is currently at floors? And can you just give us an update on kind of floor run-offs
schedule?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. So, of the $10 billion or so of variable loans that we have, we have floors to our -- in consideration to the --
on $1.8 billion of those loans. And then, if the Fed increases by 50 basis points, more than $900 million of it will
be in the money. And then 50 basis points later. Most of the book will be in the money on the floor side.
