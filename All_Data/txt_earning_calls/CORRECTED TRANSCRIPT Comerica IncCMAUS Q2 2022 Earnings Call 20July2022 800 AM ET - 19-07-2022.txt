Thank you, Darlene, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, we reported first
quarter earnings of $261 million or $1.92 per share, an increase of 40% over the first quarter. Pre-tax, pre-
provision net revenue was up 53%, and our ROE increased to 17%. These results reflect the rising rate
environment, including prudent actions we have taken to lock in higher rates. In addition, we produced strong loan
growth and generated a solid increase in fee income. While the overall economic environment is uncertain,
overall, our customers are generally optimistic about the future. And while they may be seeing some pressure on
their margins, they remain in good shape.
As I discussed on our last earnings call, we kicked off several initiatives related to modernization as we continue
to evolve and adapt to meet the changing landscape and move into a new era of banking. We believe that our
brand identity should also reflect this change. Therefore, we recently unveiled a refreshed corporate logo that
represents our commitment to both our 173-year legacy and our vision for the future. Also last month, we
announced actions taken as part of our Retail Bank transformation, which included adding small business
bankers in strategic locations, updating our web and mobile banking platforms, and expanding our interactive
teller machine network.
In addition, we are consolidating 22 or 5% of our banking centers, which is expected to be completed by the end
of the third quarter. We have continued to work on other initiatives around optimizing our facilities. The goal is to

better accommodate flexible work arrangements that reduce our footprint, while maximizing locations that best
serve our customers. In addition, as we progress on our cloud journey and decommissioned data centers, our
technology facilities are being consolidated. We are excited about the progress we have made and the path we
are laying for our future.
As far as our progress in the ESG area, I encourage you to review our 14th Annual Corporate Responsibility
related report, which was recently published. In the second quarter, our green loans and commitments continued
to grow and totaled $2 billion at quarter end. Once again, our commitment to corporate responsibility has been
recognized with honors from the National Diversity Council as one of the 50 most community-minded companies
in the US. Also, we appointed our National Hispanic Business Development Manager to further support our
commitment to strengthening relationships with Hispanic business leaders, entrepreneurs and communities. And
finally, we've established a Renewable Energy Solutions Group.
Turning now to highlights of our second quarter results outlined on slide 4. Second quarter loan growth was one
of the highest in our history, with increases in nearly every business line. The biggest drivers were general Middle
Market, large corporate, Equity Fund Services, as well as modest growth in National Dealer Services. In general,
customers are rebuilding inventory levels, which has resulted in increasing working capital needs, while CapEx
spending remains relatively slow. We are strategically managing deposits and customers are putting their excess
liquidity to work, which resulted in a decline. Net interest income benefited from higher rates, as well as growth of
our loan and hedging portfolios.
Credit quality remained excellent, and fee income increased 10% led by syndication, derivative and warrant
activities. Expenses were driven by investments we were making to support growth and performance-related
compensation. Higher revenue combined with solid expense management, resulted in significant improvement in
our efficiency ratio to 58%. Overall, a strong quarter, and we feel positive about the path we are on as we move
through the remainder of the year.
And now we'll turn the call over to Jim, who will review the quarter in more detail.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 5, as Curt just mentioned, loan growth was very
robust, increasing $1.8 billion, driven by favorable environmental factors as well as our relationship focused
approach. As of quarter end loan commitments were up $2 billion or 4% and the line utilization rate held steady at
about 46%. National Dealer Services loans increased over $400 million. This included a $200 million increase in
floor plan loans to $840 million. However, these balances remained well below our typical run rate of about $4
billion. We expect it will take some time for inventory levels to rebuild as supply issues are resolved and pent-up
demand is satisfied. General Middle Market average loans were up over 3% and large corporate grew 7%.
Borrowing needs are being driven by higher material prices and inventory levels, as well as M&A, and to a lesser
extent, CapEx. We continue to have great success in our Equity Fund Services business where we provide
capital call and subscription lines to venture capital and private equity firms.
Of note, Mortgage Banker increased about $125 million. While home sales were seasonally higher, volumes
remained depressed due to higher rates, lack of housing inventory and shorter dwell times. We expect third
quarter Mortgage Banker loans to be stable. Commercial Real Estate loans decreased, however, production
remained strong and loan commitments were up. We expect moderate loan growth in Commercial Real Estate as

projects fund through the year. Loan yields increased 42 basis points, primarily reflecting the benefit from higher
rates.
As shown on slide 6 on a year-over-year basis, average deposits were up $2.1 billion. Relative to the first quarter,
deposits declined as customers continued to put their excess liquidity to work, and we prudently managed pricing
as it relates to non-relationship based deposits in highly rate sensitive segments. Approximately half of the
decrease occurred in our Municipalities and Financial Institutions businesses, which fall under general Middle
Market. Notably, Retail and Wealth Management deposits increased. The average cost of our interest bearing
deposits remained at an all-time low of 5 basis points.
We continue to monetize our asset sensitivity as rates increased by growing our securities portfolio. Average
balances increased $1.7 billion, as shown on slide 7. During the second quarter, we purchased $3.5 billion in
MBS with average yields of 350 basis points, and we had repayments of $650 million. As we continue to execute
our balance sheet hedging strategy, we will likely pivot towards swaps given the relative size of our securities
book and the desire to maintain adequate cash to fund loan growth.
The larger portfolio, along with the favorable new purchase yields resulted in a $23 million increase in securities
income. Holding balances and rates steady at June 30 levels, third quarter securities revenue would increase
about $16 million. The rise in rates resulted in a mark-to-market impact on our securities portfolio of $850 million,
which runs through OCI and affects our book value, but not our regulatory capital ratios. While we maintain the
portfolio as available for sale, mostly for liquidity purposes, we typically hold these securities to maturity, in which
case the unrealized losses should be recouped.
Net interest income increased $105 million and the net interest margin increased 55 basis points. The benefit
from higher rates lifted loan income $52 million and added 26 basis points to the margin. Loan growth added $15
million and 3 basis points. One additional day in the quarter provided $4 million and, as I mentioned, the increase
in the size of our securities portfolio at higher yields added $23 million. Higher rates on deposits at the Fed added
$29 million, which was partly offset by lower balances and, together, added 26 basis points to the margin. Higher
rates on our floating rate wholesale debt had a $3 million impact. All together, the rise in rates provided a net
benefit of $82 million in net interest income.
Credit quality remained excellent as outlined on slide 9, including no net charge-offs. Criticized loans decreased
to a record low level and non-accrual loans declined as well. Overall, our customers have continued to perform
well, and they maintain strong balance sheets despite supply chain issues, labor constraints and inflationary
challenges.
Strong credit metrics, loan growth and a somewhat weaker economic forecast resulted in a relatively stable
allowance for credit losses at 1.18% of loans and a provision of only $10 million. As always, we are closely
monitoring the portfolio for signs of stress. Nevertheless, with our consistent, disciplined approach to credit, as
well as our relationship-based diverse portfolio, we believe we are well positioned to manage through a
recessionary environment.
Non-interest income increased $24 million, or 10%, as outlined on slide 10. Syndication activity was strong and
increased from a seasonally low first quarter, resulting in an $8 million increase in commercial lending fees.
Warrant-related income also increased $8 million. Derivative income increased $7 million, including $5 million of
favorable credit valuation adjustments, along with increased interest rate derivative activity.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
Fiduciary income increased $4 million, mainly due to annual tax-related fees. Deposit service charges increased
with a pickup in activity relative to a slow first quarter. Finally, deferred comp, which was offset in expenses,
decreased $7 million to a total negative return of $14 million for the quarter. Of note, relative to the second quarter
last year, deferred comp decreased $20 million and card fees declined $15 million due to last year's stimulus-
related activity.
Turning to expenses on slide 11. Our efficiency ratio improved 9 percentage points to 58% as we continue to
maintain our expense discipline as revenue generation accelerates and we position for future growth. Salaries
and benefits increased $5 million with a number of moving pieces. Performance-based incentives tied to our
strong financial results increased $17 million.
Annual merit, higher staff insurance and technology-related contract labor each added $4 million. This was partly
offset by the resetting of annual stock comp and payroll taxes, which impacted the first quarter. Finally, as I
mentioned on the previous slide, deferred comp asset returns decreased $7 million. Of note, our staff levels were
stable as we are successfully retaining and attracting talent in a very competitive market.
Certain technology related costs, such as software, equipment and consulting increased $8 million. Litigation-
related legal costs were higher and the increase in occupancy includes our branch consolidation activity.
Operational losses decreased from the elevated first quarter level, and we received a $4 million state tax refund.
We are experiencing some inflationary pressure, particularly in salaries, travel and entertainment and insurance.
By leveraging technology investments to increase productivity, we have been working hard to offset this
headwind.
As Curt described, we continue to make progress on certain modernization initiatives which totaled $7 million in
the second quarter. This is a journey which includes transformation of our retail banking delivery model, alignment
of corporate facilities and technology optimization. The cost savings generated are expected to be reinvested as
we continue to evolve.
Slide 12 provides details on capital management. Loans and securities portfolio growth resulted in a decrease in
our CET1 ratio to an estimated 9.72%. We continue to closely monitor loan trends, and we expect to move closer
to the targeted CET1 ratio over the near-term through capital generated from strong earnings retention. As
always, our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive
return to shareholders. Our common equity declined in the second quarter as a result of the impact of OCI losses
from our securities and swap portfolios. Excluding the OCI losses, our common equity per share increased to
$1.35.
Slide 13 provides an update on our interest rate sensitivity. The bulk of our loans are floating rate and the majority
of our deposits are non-interest-bearing. Therefore, as demonstrated in the second quarter, our balance sheet
reacts very quickly to changes in interest rates. In order to provide a more sustainable earnings stream through
the rate cycles, we have been adding hedges to lock in market expectations for future short-term rates, while
importantly reducing the downside impact of a potential decline in short rates over time.
To provide an outlook for net interest income, we use the forward curve as of June 30th, as well as expectations
for loan and deposit activity for the remainder of the year. A slightly steeper curve and added hedges have
provided incremental revenue relative to the previous outlook. We now expect 2022 net interest income to
increase by approximately 31% relative to 2021, an increase about 21% in the third quarter relative to second
quarter. Of course, there are many dynamics that may cause results to differ, specifically the pace of changes in
short-term rates, deposit betas and loan activity.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
Our outlook for 2022 is on slide 14 and assumes a continuation of the current economic environment. Given the
robust broad-based loan growth we've generated so far this year, we are increasing our expectation for average
loans to grow 6% to 7% year-over-year, excluding PPP loans. Relative to the second quarter, we expect average
loans to grow 1% to 2% per quarter. In the first half of the year, in certain areas like Middle Market, for example,
we saw increased utilization as customers work to rebuild their inventory. In the second half of the year we expect
that trend to stabilize. Consistent with customers' increased borrowing needs, we expect they will continue to
draw down deposits. Also, the impact of the fed's tightening is expected to be partly offset by our typical fourth
quarter seasonality.
As far as rates, we are closely monitoring the environment and staying close to our customers. We expect
increased deposit rates in the second half of the year and start moving towards our historical beta as interest
rates continue to increase. Net interest income expectations were reviewed on the previous slide. Credit quality is
expected to remain strong. Assuming the macroeconomic challenges continue to remain manageable, we expect
criticized and non-accrual loans to remain low, and net charge-offs could begin the trend to the lower end of our
normal range of 20 basis points to 40 basis points. We believe our reserves are appropriate for the current and
expected environment.
Non-interest income is expected to decline 6% to 7% on a year-over-year basis. Recall, that 2021 was the highest
on record, and included elevated levels of warrants, derivatives, stimulus-related card fees and deferred
compensation. We expect third and fourth quarter levels to be consistent with the second quarter. Following
strong activity in the second quarter, we expect some pressure on commercial lending fees, derivatives and
fiduciary. This may be offset by deferred comp which is difficult to predict. Therefore, we assume, will not repeat.
We expect expenses to increase 4% to 5% year-over-year, excluding any notable expenses related to our
modernization program.
This year-over-year increase is primarily due to higher performance-based compensation, annual merit,
technology investments and inflationary pressures. Relative to the first half of the year, the second half is
expected to increase 5% to 6%, excluding modernization-related expenses. The increase is driven by annual
merit, higher staff insurance, advertising, business investment and outside processing expense, partly offset by
lower performance-based comp and deferred comp. Excluding the $21 million benefit from deferred comp in the
first half, which is not expected to repeat, expenses are expected to be up 3% to 4% in the second half of the
year. We expect the tax rate to be 22% to 23%, excluding discrete items. And finally, as I indicated on the
previous slide, we are focused on our CET1 target of 10% as we monitor loan growth trends.
In summary, our outlook for the full year has improved with the benefit of higher rates, including the execution of
our hedging strategy, more robust loan and fee income generation, partly offset by higher expenses in conjunction
with growing revenue and our strong financial performance.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Thank you, Jim. Many business lines continue to show good momentum with very strong loan growth and
increases in commitments in our pipeline. Our unique expertise in many areas, as well as our geographic
footprint, offers significant opportunities. Credit quality remains excellent, a testament to our strong credit culture.
Our expense discipline was evident as we continue to invest to provide a high caliber customer and colleague
experience. Our balance sheet structure has quickly produced benefits from rising rates, and we expect to

continue to appropriately add hedges with the goal of providing a more consistent earnings performance through
the cycles. It was a strong quarter, and I'm very grateful for the dedication of my colleagues who work hard every
day to ensure Comerica's success. We believe we are well positioned to continue to produce strong results as we
move through the remainder of the year.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Scott.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, thank you [indiscernible] (20:59) question. Just wanted to discuss the NII trajectory a bit. So I think the guide
sort of parsing between the full year and the third quarter would imply it reach a fourth quarter 2022 NII of about
$720 million or so. So is that a sustainable level? And I guess, more broadly, the question is, can you just sort of
describe in layman's terms how your NII will react once it reaches its peak, and what exactly happens to the
margin this time around when rates either stabilize at a higher level or begin to come back down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Great. Scott, good morning. Thanks for the question. Yeah, your math is correct. It would imply assuming the
June 30th forward curve holds, say, fourth quarter net interest income of $720 million, I think that's a pretty good
jumping off point for 2023. Of course, we're not offering 2023 guidance at this time, but there are some puts and
takes there. We do not realize the full impact of the December and November hikes in the fourth quarter. On the
other hand, deposit betas do lag, and you could see some upward pressure there once we get beyond the fourth
quarter. And so with that said, I think it's a pretty good jumping off point in the fourth quarter. Of course, we'll have
loan volume increases and other balance sheet movement, but it does position us very well for 2023.
In terms of how we react to interest rate changes, our goal all along has been to reduce the asset sensitivity to the
point where we can produce a very high level of net interest income. And I will note that $720 million, if the
forward curve is realized, is by far and away the highest net interest income we've ever earned for a quarter. So I
think we will have achieved our goal. We left enough asset sensitivity to achieve record levels. Yet at the same
time we're protecting that net interest income. And to answer your question more directly, our goal once we enter
2023 is to have our asset sensitivity to the downside at a low single-digit percentage. So that would imply that if
short-term rates do drop, we should be largely protected. Now, over time, you will have swap securities roll off
and rolling back on. So there will be a little bit of up or down depending on what happens to the long end of the
curve. But we think we're very well positioned for 2023.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
All right. That's perfect. Thank you. And then just wanted to ask on deposit costs, the 5 basis points of deposit
cost is just terrific. You noted betas will start to ramp up in the second half here. Just curious, sort of broadly, how
you balance pressures on costs with a desire to ultimately hold certain balances.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Scott, we are paying very close attention to deposit costs. We're staying extremely close to our customers.
Those conversations are going on daily. We will clearly see those costs rise in the second half of the year. There
is a little bit of a lag typically between when those discussions happen and when they're fully realized. So I've
heard in some other earnings calls in terms of when the real pivot point is. And frankly, I don't think you can ever
point to any one fed hike when these hikes are so close to each other. But we will certainly start seeing us move
towards not just our standard betas in the third quarter, but by the end of the year we'll probably be approaching
our standard beta for the accumulated standard beta that we publish also. But those conversations will go on. And
I'll just stress that it's a very relationship based model here. So it's based on the forward relationship with the
customer, it's based on those conversations. And we feel like we're in very good communication with the
customers and feel good about our positioning there.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
Can you help us understand what you're seeing and hearing from borrowers in terms of the economic outlook?
We're all on recession watch. And I guess, I'd love to hear your views. And maybe for you, Melinda, can you just
touch on what kind of an economic outlook your 1.18% reserve level reflects?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Jon, this this Peter. I'll go first on customers and then Melinda you can talk about the economic outlook. But I think
recession watch that you used there, that's not unique to you or all of us. Our customers are probably in the same
boat. That said, I think that they are doing really well. Our pipeline is strong. Our activity levels are good. So it's
hard to see sort of immediate concerns.
I think a lot of their concerns that we hear are a lot or further out, they don't feel like 2022 concerns, but obviously
inflation, interest rates, all the things that we're dealing with. But the outlook, we said generally optimistic, we still
feel that way. We're encouraged about what we're seeing. It does depend a little bit on geography, and it does
depend a little bit on line of business. But overall, we feel like our sentiment of our customers is still pretty good at
this time. Melinda, do you want to comment on [indiscernible] (26:28)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Jon, thanks for the question. So as you know, we use a variety of third-party forecasts, and the Q2
economic forecast, although it was still positive, did show some deterioration from the first quarter with weaker
growth, higher likelihood of recession and a much higher degree of uncertainty. So our baseline forecast, I would
say, was slightly worse than our Q1 forecast.
We also use a severe recessionary scenario [ph] of the (26:57) stress, certain parts of our portfolio, and this is
really used to inform the qualitative component. And those qualitatives continue to comprise a meaningful
component of the total reserve. So we feel really good about our reserve levels at this point. We believe that they
are appropriately conservative for the economic environment, including kind of the near-term uncertainty.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So general message on provision would be growth plus charge-offs, and that's generally adequate in your
view at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Assuming the economic forecast remains sort of stable and the portfolio metrics don't change to the
downside, the reserve build will tend to tie pretty closely to loan growth, and then obviously if the economic
forecast worsens, then we'll see reserve builds. But as you know, this is a complex process that we go through
each quarter, and it would be pretty impossible to guesstimate what that would actually be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q

Hey, Steve.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone. So first to drill down on deposits, historically speaking, companies drawing down
on deposits to fund business investment was a good thing, but we also have companies now drawing down to
earn a higher yield. Curious, when you guys look at the $42 billion of non-interest-bearing, how much of that do
you see that could be a risk of outflows?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Hey, Steve, good morning. If you look at where we were pre-pandemic, our mix of non-interest-bearing deposits
was just under 50%. I think it was 48% to 49%. You see that we're closer to 55% this quarter. I think that might be
a good proxy for where we could end up if rates go up to where the forward curve is predicting right now. So it's
going to be a little bit dependent on ECA rates and other levers we pull to either keep customers on or off the
balance sheet, but I think that would be a pretty good proxy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Steve, I might add, this is Peter. I mean, a lot of our deposits that are going to be rate-driven are going to
be in our bigger businesses, you might say, so call it US banking or business deposit services businesses where
they're moving higher deposits but – we have relationships, but it's not – we don't have like all the treasury
managers, we don't have all the relationships. So they're deposits that are going to move for rate, but we can
negotiate that if we need to. We can be more aggressive if we need to. But I mean, we feel like we can have
conversations and handle that appropriately.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
Okay. Actually to follow up on that, so if we think through this, the Fed actions are going to have an outsized
impact on deposit markets. How do you see that playing out into the business, and do you think that you might
continue to see deposit run-off in 2023, could this just continue through next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
I think we will see the bulk of it likely in that fourth quarter of 2022 to first quarter of 2023 range, at least that's our
forecast right now. Predicting deposits is always a little bit challenging, not just pricing can lag a little bit but
sometimes customer reaction can lag a little bit too. Having said that, these outsized changes by the Fed do put
the antenna up on some customers, so maybe we won't see quite the same lag we've seen in the past. But I do
think it's kind of in that crossover range of fourth quarter to first quarter.
But having said that, you'll recall earlier from my opening comments, we usually get seasonality in the fourth
quarter. So it may not be apparent when you see the fourth quarter results, it would probably manifest more in the
first quarter. But I would expect most of that to shake out by the first quarter of 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q

Okay. That's helpful. If I could squeeze one more in, going back to Jon's question on customer sentiment, when I
look at line utilization – not line utilization, but commitments increasing, it could be a sign that customers are more
optimistic, or it could mean a sign that they're more cautious on recession coming. Are you guys really convinced
that what you're seeing is because of optimism in their business and not just companies historically want to get
more credit before a recession comes? Thanks.

Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Steve, again, it's Peter. Yeah, I would say that that is true. We don't really see this as defensive ask or recession
concerns. Certainly nothing like what we saw when the pandemic started and we saw tremendous asks for
recession lines of credit insurance, that's not what we're seeing. Right now we're seeing business reason asks for
all those things that Jim and Curt outlined of working capital needs, everything costs more money. There's good
M&A opportunities for some of these companies. So no, it's all pretty legitimate business needs. And at this time,
it doesn't appear to be, or we're not seeing indications of it being recession preparation sort of asks.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
Good morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I guess just one, Jim, to follow up on Scott's initial question around NII, and just want to make sure we understand
your comments correctly. In a world where the fed stops hiking by the end of the year, potentially gets to cutting
interest rates at some point in 2013, do you expect NII in that backdrop to stabilize compared to, and I'm looking
back to 2019 when NII peaked the same quarter when the fed stopped hiking. I'm just trying to make sure the
impact of your swaps essentially implies that that $720 million plus kind of NII will still hold for the foreseeable
future until some of these swaps roll off, which is in the out years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yes, Ebrahim. We feel we are much, much better positioned. If rates were to drop in 2023 than we were in 2019,
we were somewhat exposed there and had not finished the hedging program. We feel much better about holding
on to the higher levels of net interest income this time around. And as I mentioned, the goal by the end of the year
is to get down to the single-digit percent of net interest income at risk, for a gradual 100-bp hike or 50 bps on
average. So we should hold on to most of that income as we move to 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jim, [ph] I'd just add (33:44) with some puts and takes around where deposit betas might go and what loan growth
does in 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
That's right. Yeah, certainly some ins and outs there. As I mentioned, the full impact of November, December
hikes isn't factored into that fourth quarter guidance. Loan volume [ph] is not (34:03) factored in, but deposit betas
made leg into the year. So you definitely see moving parts go in different directions. But I mean, the whole goal all
along, Ebrahim, as you know, and you've heard us say, is to protect ourselves, better protect ourselves from a
drop in rate. So that's what we've been working on, and we're largely successful up to this point, and we plan on
being done with the overall program by the end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Sure. And I'm sorry if I missed this. Did you mention, Jim, what's the deposit beta you're assuming by the end of
the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Well, we typically think about a 30% standard beta. I do think that we will, through the third quarter, be
approaching that with hikes, and probably go a little past it for individual hikes by the end of the year. I don't know
that the accumulated standard beta will be fully reflected in the fourth quarter results just because of the lag and
the full quarter effect. I mean, it could be, but at this point, I think it's more likely to be early the first quarter of
2023. But we'll see how market forces react and respond and how we work with our customers.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And if I could one on the lending side, I think you mentioned dealer finance close to $840 million versus $4
billion pre-pandemic. I mean, one, I'm assuming inventory build for cars will help that. But do you think that
business may have structurally changed where we never get to that $4 billion? I would love to hear your thoughts
in terms of what you're hearing from your clients. And second, I think, the other thing that you mentioned, I think,
Curt, was you're not seeing a high degree of CapEx spend driving demand. Just give us a sense of what's holding
back customers around CapEx. We heard some of your peers talk about actually CapEx contributing to growth.
So would loan any perspective on both those.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Ebrahim, it's Peter. So on dealer, the question you asked was about whether or not we'll ever get back to the $4
billion levels, and that's a question the industry in general is dealing with. What do days inventory look like on the
other side of this cycle that we're in, and I don't know that there's a clear answer to it. As of right now, we still see
really low inventory levels on dealer lots. Our floor plan usage is still really, really low compared to historical
levels, and whether it gets back to the $4 billion is to be determined. We believe, and I think when you talk to a lot
of customers, that it's probably somewhere in the middle. I don't think you're going to see 90 days of inventory,
but I don't think you're going to see 10 days either. It's probably 50 to 60.
But at the same time, different OEMs are communicating different things to the dealers. And so we'll just kind of
see what that looks like on a go forward basis. As far as the CapEx, I don't want to suggest to you that there's no
CapEx going on. I think that most of our customer base, though, is being, as we have said, recession watch,
making sure that they don't do something that stretches themselves too much. So we are seeing a little bit of
CapEx, but it's not probably the main driver of the borrowings that we have mentioned. So you do see some of it. I
think that it's all been very prudent, and we make sure to talk to our customers about what sort of investments
they're wanting to make and understand those. And so far we're seeing really good decisions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ken Usdin Q

Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, just on the cost side, I know you're recalibrating in the second half versus
the first, and that deferred comp is a part of it. But just wondering, with the inflationary environment, just can you
14


Comerica, Inc.
(CMA) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
talk through the types of pressures you're seeing there built into that. And then how you think about that translates
as you look further ahead relative to the all the points that have been made about the NII strength in terms of
operating leverage and how much of that incremental NII falls to the bottom line as we look further out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Hey, good morning, Ken. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we are seeing some inflationary pressures. We're seeing
it certainly on the salary side in terms of attraction and retention of talent. We think we're doing a really good job
of calibrating that and hitting the right balance. We're seeing it a little bit, as contracts renew there's a bit of a lag
effect there. So I think that will probably stick with us over the next year since contracts obviously don't renew on
a frequent basis. T&D, we're seeing it, as I mentioned. I think anyone that's even personally travelled have seen
that. Insurance, the insurance market has been hit a little bit hard. That's probably for factors in addition to
inflation, but it is going to put some pressure.
I mentioned earlier this year that, I thought overall on a full year basis it would perhaps add 1% to the overall
expense base. And I think we're probably looking at least probably about 1% for the second half of the year alone
in terms of pressure. And we'll probably see that continue a little bit next year. In terms of operating leverage,
that's always our goal to achieve positive operating leverage. We obviously did it this quarter. The goal is to do it
going forward now that we're stabilizing net interest income. Having said that, we're not prepared to offer
guidance in 2023 yet, but that is always the goal to generate positive operating leverage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jim, I might just add from a bigger picture perspective. I mean, we are managing the business for the long-term,
and we're taking advantage of the current rate environment to make sure that we're appropriately balancing
expenses versus revenue growth and trying to find ways to be relevant from a revenue perspective on a go-
forward basis. So we've had eight consecutive quarters of double-digit ROE, 17% this quarter or 58% efficiency
ratio. And so, continuing to invest in technology and digital will be relevant there to our customers and to our
colleagues.
We've made some geographic expansions into the southeast and as well as into the Denver and for the Mountain
Central region, we've been adding some capacity in terms of REMs and advisors in our Commercial and Wealth
Management business. We talked about the new Renewable Energy Group [Renewable Energy Solutions
Group]. So there are some things we're doing to continue to add capacity as we sort of go forward and sort of
take advantage of this higher rate environment. But we've done a good job historically of managing expenses.
Certainly if the environment changes, we know how to manage expenses appropriately. But sort of balancing the
two is really important for us, taking the longer term view.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Got it. I appreciate that. And just one follow-up question on the loan side. Almost all of the specialty businesses
showed good direction, and I think that might have been a little surprising, especially in what's going on in dealer
mortgage Equity Fund Services. Can you just kind of flush out, as you expect the loan growth to continue, how do
you expect some of those to act, and are you seeing just better underlying trends in some of the supply constrain-
related areas? Thanks.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Ken. It was a great quarter with all of our businesses kind of moving in the right direction. The only one that
we didn't really see was Commercial Real Estate. But as we mentioned, we booked a ton of business and we
expect that to continue. So the outlook for all of them continues to be pretty positive. As I think we've said, maybe
not in the second half of the year, what we've seen in the first half, but it does feel positive. I think mortgage
bankers probably going to be flat to maybe down into the fourth quarter. We haven't seen the type of activity, as
everybody knows, with interest rates, housing inventory, affordability. I think that business will probably stay a little
flat. But the rest of the businesses have got really good pipelines, really good outlooks, and we feel good about it.
So it was nice for it to all be moving in the same direction this quarter, and we're encouraged that we would see
that again this next quarter. Thank you, Ken.

Hello, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Good morning. I want to start with just the earning asset aspect of the equation, a lot of discussion on
deposits. Can you help us with kind of targeted or minimum cash levels, given the liquidity that's being removed
from the system? And also, I think you touched upon in your prepared remarks, back in office securities
purchases I was trying to see, trying to gauge what the asset levels will be for the next two quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Hey, Chris, good morning. Yeah. Historically, we have always maintained probably a little larger cash buffer than
perhaps other regional banks just because of our commercial banking model. So typically we like to hold at least
$2 billion to $3 billion in cash, and if we have a little more than that it doesn't necessarily bother us. Obviously,
we're starting to approach those levels. We certainly have very strong and efficient borrowing channels, whether it
be broker deposits or FHLB line. So to the extent we start getting down to those minimum cash levels they need
to borrow, that's not necessarily worrisome for us whatsoever. It's been contemplated and it's really what we've
been preparing for. So we feel really good about how we're managing that.
Where earning assets go overall, that's obviously going to be dependent on loan growth and where deposits go.
So there's a lot of ins and outs there. We're not necessarily forecasting earning asset levels themselves. But we
feel really comfortable with what we're mapping out over the next couple years in terms of managing cash and
being able to fund loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And then if I could, as a follow up to Steve's question about the DDA reversion, I guess – mean reversion.
If I'm looking at the mix of deposits, you said a couple of years ago it was high-40s, now it's mid-50s. If you look at
16


Comerica, Inc.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
the dollar difference, it's pretty meaningful. So I'm just a little more interested in how do you get to your target, call
it 50% mix. Is it growing others and shrinking, or is it purely shrinking DDA by multiples of billions? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
It's going to be a combination. We will see overall deposits, of course, go down, and you'll see some of that from
both DDA and interest bearing. But at the same time you will see, even for balances that stay on the balance
sheet, you will see for rate sensitive customers and where we're price competitive, you will see some of those
DDAs move to interest bearing. So I feel like it's a little bit of a 50-50 mix in terms of how that mix changes. It'll be
a combination of both overall DDA leaving the balance sheet, but also DDA moving into interest bearing.

Morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Morning. Just want to follow up on the loan front. I think it was follow-up to Ken's question. I know you gave your
expectation on the components, specifically around the mortgage warehouse [ph] – let me get it – (45:45) stable
to down. Can you maybe give us your thoughts on the other buckets specifically? I believe you said modest
growth you expect in Commercial Real Estate, but I want to confirm that, and then maybe if you can talk about
Equity Fund Services outlook, Corporate Banking and Middle Market. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, John, it's Peter. So I guess I'll try to take those one at a time. The Equity Fund Services outlook is still
pretty good. There's been a lot about private equity funding, fund formation and so forth. Our utilization was
actually down in EFS this quarter, but our commitments grew, our outstandings grew despite that. And so we're
encouraged by what we're seeing. We feel like we're a leader in that business and feel really good about the
opportunities, knowing that there is some challenges in the fundraising space. But overall, we've got a really good
pipeline there.
Our corporate business, so US banking has had really good success. That is probably – on our customer
sentiment, I think larger companies with more geographic or international [ph] national (46:56) exposure, that's
where our sentiment probably did drop a little bit more than the rest of our portfolio. That said, we did have a
really good quarter and our activity level there continues to be really good. Within US banking, we've got some
17


Comerica, Inc.
(CMA) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2022
great specialty businesses around our gaming business, around our sports franchise lending business. And so
the activity level there continues to be really, really solid.
And then Middle Market in general you asked about is really encouraging in all of our geographies. We've got a
great activity level in Texas. Michigan continues to be really strong, California has come back from kind of where
it was last year, a little bit behind, although we did see a little bit of drop in sentiment in California versus the other
two markets. But our activity level is still really, really strong. And then we're starting to see really good
opportunities out of Southeast. We have told you all that we've invested down there. We're hiring relationship
managers, and we feel really good about the opportunities that we're starting to see there.
And then on Commercial Real Estate, John, what I said there is we didn't see maybe as much outstanding loan
growth in the second quarter, but we did see a tremendous amount of commitment production. We bank a lot of
really great developers. Most of the business we're doing there is with existing customers. So it's not like we're
reaching with new customers, and the opportunities for those customers have been really, really good. And so we
expect to see outstandings increase from here with Commercial Real Estate just with the amount of activity that
we have closed so far. So I hope that gives you a little bit more, John, on each of the businesses that you're
asking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
No. That does. That's helpful. Thank you. And then my follow up is just around loan growth overall. I know you're
looking at 6% to 7% growth, ex-PPP, for 2022, which is pretty solid. And I know you're not formally out there with
2023 expectations, but wanted to see if you could maybe help us think about the trajectory of that growth rate as
you look at 2023, particularly with the expectation of potential economic slowing. Is it fair to assume a growth rate
somewhere below that level, or could you see it hold in that mid to high single-digit range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
John, it's Peter. I'll comment first, and I don't know if Jim wants to add. But we're going to continue to do
everything we can to keep that growth rate, as we have said, above GDP. We're striving to do that in all of our
markets. And if you look at the outlook for Texas and California and Michigan, those GDP outlooks are better than
national averages. So we're going to continue to try to achieve that. Whether or not that looks like 6% to 7% in
2023 versus the overall economy, I don't know. But we do believe that our company can perform at a level better
than what you might see on national GDP levels, is how I would answer your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's good. I think we would be optimistic, but a lot of it's going to depend on the economy and how
we move through 2023.

Good morning, Jennifer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Good morning. With the deposit growth slowed down significantly for the industry, just wondering what Comerica
is doing in terms of tweaking its strategy there, whether it be employee incentives related to deposit gathering, or
adding more small business bankers. Can you just give us some details on how you're thinking about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jennifer, this is Curt. I might make a couple of comments and then turn. First of all, I mean, perspective is really
important here, we're at a 68% loan-to-deposit ratio, and we do not chase sort of transactional hot deposits.
Everything we do is from a relationship based focus. And so whether it's in our Commercial Bank and our Retail
Bank, in our Wealth Management organization, we've got the ability to flex up on pricing if we need to do that, and
sort of watching we're going to do the right things from our customer perspective. And then we've got access to
plenty of other funding sources leveraging our securities portfolio, FHLB, et cetera. And so on the list of things
that I'm concerned about as CEO, this is way down that list. And you look at sort of where we were post-
pandemic, we were in the 90% plus range on loan-to-deposit perspective. And so we still got plenty of funding to
take care of our customers and appropriately grow the balance sheet. And so we're just trying to make sure we're
staying focused on the relationship side of this, leveraging treasury management services, and so maybe Peter
you want to talk about that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Jennifer, this is Peter. I was just going to add to Curt's comments, that we are investing a lot and looking at
our digital experience on the commercial side and making sure that we're a leader in that space, and making it as
easy as we possibly can for our customers to interact with us digitally and providing all those products and
services. So that's where we're leaning in on this issue when it comes to gathering deposits into the future,
particularly as you mentioned, I think you'll see more talk from us about the small business space, which is a great
deposit business. But we're focused on that investment as it relates to products and services. I think the digital
customer experience for commercial customers is one that we can lean into heavily and that we can lead in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. And I would just say, along with digital deposits, I'd love the emphasis we're putting on treasury
management investment. And I love treasury management, we love treasury management not just for the non-
interest income, but the deposits that come with it. So I would certainly lean on that as part of the mix also.

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. Hey, my questions were largely answered. So I just thought I'd ask in terms of capital. I
don't believe you were active in the buyback this quarter with your CET1 under 10%. As you think about kind of
building that back up over 10% late this year or say early in 2023, if that comes to pass, given the kind of
uncertainty in terms of the economy and growth, would you [indiscernible] (54:02) maybe being more constrained
on the buyback, even in that scenario where you're back over 10% over the next several quarters, let's say?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Gary. We do think we will, at least in our baseline forecast, likely get back to 10% by the end of the
year. I think we can accrete capital at 10 to 15 bps per quarter, maybe closer to 15 bps. I think once we get there,
we'll do an assessment of where we stand, where the economy is. On one hand, I am really excited about the fact
that we will stabilize net interest income, stabilize a lot of earnings. That makes it a little easier to activate things
like the share buyback. On the other hand, we are very aware of the volatility of CECL, what that can do to capital
ratios, and we would certainly give that a fair amount of consideration as we start reaching 10% and going above.
We would look at the credit environment, and that would certainly weigh on how quickly we weigh back into a
share repurchase program.

Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Morning. Just following up on your asset sensitivity here. You guys talked about next year wanting to be in the, I
guess, single-digit range for downside to NII in the event of rate cut. I just want to confirm, I see on the deck that it
looks like no more swaps are needed for the loan book, or maybe how much more do you guys need to add to get
to that level?

James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Yeah. I think we have on the slide that we will likely need up to $10 billion of hedges to get
to the low single-digit percents. That is likely to be more of a swap strategy as opposed to a security strategy at
this point given our cash levels. But I will emphasize up to, it is going to be dependent upon how the balance
sheet shifts, deposit levels will probably be the most important variable there. So it could end up being far less
than $10 billion. But I would just say up to $10 billion, and then it could be far less than $10 billion depending on
how the balance sheet shapes up.
