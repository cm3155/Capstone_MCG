Executive Vice President-Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and
CEO, Bruce van Saun, and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our first quarter results. Brendan
Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking, and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide
additional color. We will be referencing our first quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations
website. After the presentation, we'll be happy to take questions.
Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page 2 of the
presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on
page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix.
With that, I will hand over to you, Bruce.

Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. There clearly have been changes
in the external environment relative to what was expected coming into the year, along with significant volatility.
We feel we've executed well in this environment and are positioned to perform well over the course of 2022.
Among the highlights of the quarter, we had a successful conversion of the HSBC branch and online customers,
which was then followed by closing the Investors acquisition on April 6. We continue to take actions to position
our balance well for rising rates. And we've made further progress on our strategic initiatives, including our digital
agenda and TOP 7 program.
With respect to our financial results, we are off to a good start with underlying EPS of $1.07 and ROTCE of 13%.
This is generally our softest quarter from a seasonal standpoint, given fewer days in the quarter and the impact of
payroll taxes on expenses. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially, given 3% average loan growth and
higher NIM, which more than offset a sizable drag from lower PPP loan forgiveness revenue and day count. We
saw lower revenue in capital markets and mortgages, given the environment, so high volatility benefited our
global markets hedging business.
We maintain strong deal pipelines in capital markets and remain optimistic for a significant revenue pick-up if
markets stabilize. We managed the expenses well in the quarter, and turnover has normalized somewhat. Credit

metrics are all excellent. And so far, both our consumer and corporate customers are navigating well through the
current challenges.
Our balance sheet remains in great shape with a CET1 ratio of 9.7%. We have the capacity to grow loans, pursue
fee-based bolt-on acquisitions, raise our dividend in the second half of the year and buy back some stock. Our
loan growth has picked up on the commercial side, and we plan to throttle back our growth in mortgage and auto,
which will maintain an attractive LDR.
I'd like to shift gears to emphasize a few key points that are topical for investors at the moment. First, and to be
clear, we will benefit nicely from the accelerated path to higher rates. Our funding base is vastly improved from
where it was entering the last rate upcycle. We had a 7% benefit from a 200 basis point gradual rise in rates, a 10
basis point cost of interest-bearing deposits and 83% loan-to-deposit ratio. We project roughly $300 million in
higher NII, given the current curve, which annualizes to much more in 2023. This will more than offset roughly
$100 million in lower fee income from the environment. John will take you through this in detail in his remarks.
Second, while inflation pressures are real and the possibility of recession in 2023 has increased, we feel our
credit risk position is in very good shape. We have maintained a super prime to high prime risk appetite in
consumer. And over time, we have migrated our credit exposure in commercial to bigger companies who have
better credit profiles. As a result, our overall credit profile has improved over time. Our real-life and CCAR stress
test results demonstrate that our credit profile is slightly better than middle of the super-regional pack. And we
have carefully assessed Investors' credit book and loss history and remain confident in their positioning, which we
will further harmonize over time.
Lastly, with respect to acquisitions, I would like to highlight that our focus in 2022 is on integrating the acquisitions
that we made last year and getting each of those off to a strong start, particularly our New York City Metro area
initiative. We will still look for acquisitions in the wealth space, but we are a highly disciplined acquirer and have
not been able to get much done as a result. With respect to Florida, we now have eight branches in the state and
job one is bringing them to network performance levels. There does not appear to be much to do that's attractive
inorganically, and the likely path is that we will open several more wealth centers in additional cities down the
road. In short, you can count on us to maintain the strong financial discipline we've exhibited since the IPO.
All in all, we feel very good about how we've started the year and how we are positioned to navigate the
challenging environment. Given the significant move in rates and the closing of the two bank acquisitions, we've
provided detailed guidance in our earnings presentation to assist analysts and investors in updating their models.
We continue our journey to building a great bank that can do ever more for our stakeholders.
And with that, I'll turn it over to John.

Great. Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with our headlines for the quarter. We reported
underlying net income of $476 million and EPS of $1.07. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 13%, which
includes the impact of a modest credit provision benefit. Net interest income was up 2% linked quarter, driven by
stronger loan growth and a 9 basis point improvement in margin. Period-end loan growth was up a solid 2% linked
quarter. Our retail loans are up about 3%, while commercial loans are up 2% or 3% ex PPP impacts. Average
loans are up 3% linked quarter paced by commercial, up 3% or 4% ex PPP and retail up 3%.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Fees were down 16% linked quarter, driven primarily by lower capital market fees of a record prior quarter, given
market volatility, seasonal impacts and some pull forward of transactions into the fourth quarter. On a positive
note, we had our best quarter ever in interest rate and commodities revenues as we helped clients manage
through the volatile environment. We remain disciplined on expenses, which were up 3% sequentially, excluding
acquisitions, reflecting seasonal payroll tax impacts. Year-over-year expenses were up a modest 2%, excluding
acquisitions.
We recorded an underlying credit provision benefit of $21 million, which reflects strong credit performance across
the retail and commercial portfolios. The near-term macroeconomic outlook remains positive, though we are
monitoring whether Fed actions to slow inflation can do so while engineering a soft landing for the economy. The
underlying credit benefit for the quarter excludes $24 million for the double count of day one CECL provision
expense tied to the HSBC transaction.
Our ACL ratio stands at 1.43%, down slightly from 1.51% at the end of 2021 and the 1.47% day one CECL level.
Our tangible book value per share was down 10.5% linked quarter, driven primarily by the impact of rising rates
on securities and hedge valuations that impact AOCI. We continue to have a very strong capital position with
CET1 at 9.7% after a 20 basis point impact from the HSBC transaction.
Next, I'll provide some key takeaways for the first quarter while referring to the presentation slides. Net interest
income on slide 6 was up 2%, given strong loan growth and the benefit of higher rates more than offsetting the
approximately $41 million combined impact from the lower day count and the reduced benefit from PPP
forgiveness. The net interest margin was 2.75%, up 9 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher rates with front
book yields rising, which more than offset reduced PPP benefit.
Margin is also benefiting from lower cash balances as we continue to redeploy some of our excess liquidity into
loan growth. Of note, PPP spot loans were down to roughly $400 million at quarter-end and forgiveness benefits
headwinds are substantially behind us. We made continued progress lowering our interest-bearing deposit costs,
which are now 10 basis points, an all-time low, down 3 basis points linked quarter.
Moving to slide 7, given the Fed's recent rate hike and the expectation for Fed funds rate to end the year in the
225 basis points to 250 basis points range, we thought it would be helpful to discuss why we are confident that we
will realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out. We entered this race cycle with a
much higher level of asset sensitivity at 10% before the first rate hike in March. This is already starting to benefit
NII in the first quarter and is driving a significant improvement in our full year outlook, and those benefits will
continue to accumulate into 2023. Importantly, our expected asset sensitivity reflects how we have completely
transformed our funding base since the IPO.
We are beginning the current upcycle with a very strong liquidity profile. Our LDR is much lower. Our deposit
costs are as low as they've ever been, and our overall funding profile has greatly improved. Our period-end
demand deposits sits are our 32% of the book compared with 27% at the beginning of the last rate cycle. And
within our interest-bearing deposits, our consumer CDs are now less than 3% of total deposits compared with
about 10% at the start of the last cycle.
We are also starting this cycle with a much lower level of floating wholesale funding. This improved deposit profile
reflects the significant improvements we've made to our deposit franchise since the IPO with improved and
expanded retail and commercial deposit offerings. We have also enhanced data analytics that allow us to attract
and retain more stable deposits.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
With a better starting position and the improvements in our deposit mix and capabilities, we expect our interest-
bearing beta to be about 35% over this rate cycle, which is meaningfully lower than the last cycle. Our overall
asset sensitivity stands at 7% at the end of the first quarter. This is down modestly from 10% at the end of 4Q with
the decrease primarily driven by the denominator impacts of our higher NII outlook, given the benefits from the
April 6 forward curve and the evolution of the balance sheet. Pro forma for the Investors acquisition asset
sensitivity is slightly over 6%.
Since the path of the rate cycle is uncertain, on the bottom left side of this page, we've given you an estimate of
our sensitivity to further changes in rates, either up or down from the forward curve. Potentially, a 25 basis point
instantaneous change in the forward curve is worth about $20 million to $25 million a quarter with most of that
coming from our exposure to the short end of the curve. This includes the pro forma impact of Investors.
Moving on to slide 8, we delivered good fee results this quarter despite headwinds for capital markets,
demonstrating the strength and diversity of our businesses and we drove solid performance across other fee
categories. Capital markets delivered solid results despite the market volatility, seasonal impacts and some pull-
forward into the full fourth quarter of 2021. Given the strength of our pipelines, capital markets fees could rebound
nicely as markets settle down and there is more certainty regarding the path of the economy. Demonstrating the
diversity of our business, we delivered our best quarterly results ever in global markets, up 46% quarter linked
quarter as we work with clients to manage their foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity exposures.
Mortgage fees were down 9% linked quarter against the backdrop of lower industry origination volumes, given
rising rates and seasonal impacts. Strong competition and excess industry capacity continued to pressure
margins. Mortgage servicing income improved as higher mortgage rates resulted in slower amortization of the
MSR. Card fees and service charges and fees were slightly lower linked quarter given seasonality. Debit
transactions and credit card spend continued to exceed pre-pandemic levels and wealth fees also remained
strong.
On slide 9, expenses were well controlled, up 3% linked quarter and just 2% year-on-year, excluding acquisitions.
Our TOP 7 efficiency program is well underway, targeting $100 million of pre-tax run rate benefits by the end of
the year.
Period-end loans on slide 10 were up 2% linked quarter. We were pleased to see strong commercial loan growth
again this quarter up 2% or 3% ex PPP. Average loans were up 3% linked quarter, driving this was average
commercial loan growth of 3% or 4% ex PPP impacts led by C&I with growth across almost every region,
including our expansion markets. Average retail growth was also 3%.
Line utilization began to rebound a bit with an increase of about 150 basis points to a little over 36% on a spot
basis, primarily driven by corporate banking, led by manufacturing and trade as companies look to build
inventories to get ahead of supply chain issues and rising input prices and facilitate some M&A activity.
On slide 11, our period-end deposits were up 3% linked quarter as we added $6.3 billion of lower cost deposits
with the HSBC transaction. Excluding HSBC, period-end and average deposits were down slightly, given
seasonal impacts as well as continued normalization from elevated liquidity levels.
Moving on to credit on slide 12, we saw excellent credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial
portfolios. Net charge-offs were up slightly at 19 basis points for the first quarter with good performance across
the portfolio. Non-performing loans increased by $87 million linked quarter, primarily driven by residential real
estate secured loans exiting forbearance.

Other credit metrics continue to look excellent across the retail and commercial portfolios and criticized loans
were lower. While we are mindful of inflationary pressures and the higher possibility of recession, we feel good
about the improvements to the portfolio we've made over the last few years and the overall positioning of our
credit risk.
In the event, on slide 21, you'll see that the risk profile of our commercial portfolio has significantly improved,
given changes through the pandemic, including prudent lending and a focus on growing the bigger mid-corporate
credit portfolio, which is higher rated, as well as reductions in stressed sectors, such as retail malls, education and
casual dining. On the retail side, we continue to focus on the super prime and prime segment. Our risk profile has
improved, given our disciplined risk appetite and changes in our portfolio mix, including the runoff of our personal
and secured product. Of note, Investors' portfolios have performed well in prior cycles and we feel good about
them.
Moving to slide 13, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remained strong at 9.7% at
the end of the first quarter after closing the HSBC transaction, which had a 20-basis-point impact. We also wanted
to mention that we have widened our target CET1 operating range to 9.5% to 10% from 9.75% to 10%, reflective
of the continued progress we've made in improving profitability, revenue diversity and overall risk management.
Our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed and you can expect us to remain extremely
disciplined in how we manage the company.
Shifting gears a bit on slide 14, you'll see some examples of the progress we've made against the key strategic
initiatives and other work we are doing across the bank to better serve our customers and make Citizens a great
place to work. As you know, we closed the acquisition of Investors at the beginning of April, further expanding the
foothold we established in the New York City Metro area through the HSBC branch transaction and significantly
advancing our growth plans.
In the consumer business, we were excited to complete the upgrade of Citizens' access to a fully cloud-enabled
core platform, which enhances the capabilities of our national digital bank and is the first step toward our
multiyear objective of convergence with our core banking platforms. We also recently announced Citizens
EverValue Checking, a new overdraft-free checking account designed to meet Bank On National Account
standards and increase banking access for underserved communities.
On the commercial side, we continue to perform well in the league tables, consistently ranking in the top 10 as a
middle market and sponsor bookrunner. On the right side of the page, we've included some digital metrics. We
are very excited with how our digital-first approach is increasing engagement with our customers and how this is
all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction.
Given the significant change in the rate environment and the closing of our two bank acquisitions, we provided a
comprehensive update to our 2022 guidance on slide 15. The good news here is that our guide is up in our
standalone business. Rates are helping NII, more than offsetting the fact that we are down a little on fees. So,
PPNR is higher and there is no change in our positive view on credit and we remain confident in the outlook for
the bank deals. I'll focus my comments on the full year outlook, including both HSBC and Investors. But we've
also added the standalone outlook without the bank deals to help isolate performance.
We have also included a comparison to our original guide from January to help highlight what is driving the overall
improvement in the full year outlook. The rate scenario used in our outlook is based on the forward curve as of
April 6, which implies a Fed funds target of 225 basis points to 250 basis points by the end of the year.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
On the long end, this rate curve implies the 10-year treasury to be above 270 basis points at the end of the year.
It is also useful to keep in mind that the cumulative benefit from rates would also represent meaningful full year
effect upside to NII in 2023.
For 2022, we expect NII to be up 27% to 30%, driven primarily by the improved rate environment and solid
average loan growth of 20% to 22%. On a standalone basis, NII is about $290 million to $330 million better than
our prior guidance given the higher rates. Average interest earning assets are expected to be up 14% to 16%.
Fee income is expected to be up 3% to 7%. On a standalone basis, fee revenue will be about $100 million lower
than the January guide as the environment will impact mortgage revenue as well as capital markets somewhat.
Non-interest expense is expected to be up 16% to 18%, given the full year effect of HSBC and Investors as well
as our commercial fee-based acquisitions.
Credit is expected to remain excellent with net charge-offs broadly stable to down slightly for the year. And we
expect to end the year with a CET1 ratio of about 9.75%, which incorporates an anticipated increase in our
dividend in the second half of the year. Our capital projections include the impact of our expected notable items
for the year, including the integration expenses for the acquisitions and our TOP 7 costs. You can see those in the
appendix on slide 20.
Importantly, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage of approximately 2% on an underlying basis for the
year, excluding the acquisitions. And if you set aside the impact of PPP, that would be over 4% operating
leverage. Including acquisitions, we expect operating leverage of over 4% and over 7%, excluding PPP. Overall,
we expect our full year ROTCE to land solidly within our 14% to 16% medium-term target range.
Moving to side 16, I'll walk through the outlook for the second quarter. On a standalone basis, we expect NII to be
up 6% to 8%, driven by the benefit of higher rates and solid loan growth. With the bank acquisitions, we expect
NII to be up 27% to 29%. On a stand-alone basis, average loans are expected to be up 1% to 2%, led by
commercial with interest-earning assets up slightly. Fees are expected to be up 3% to 5% on a stand-alone basis,
reflecting some improvement in capital markets and seasonal benefits. Including the acquisitions fees are
expected to be up 7% to 9%.
Non-interest expense on a stand-alone basis is expected to be up 1% to 2%, given higher revenue-based
compensation. Including the acquisitions, expenses are expected to be up 12% to 13%. Net charge-offs are
expected to be broadly stable, and we expect our CET1 ratio to land at around 9.75%.
To sum up, with slide 17 and 18, we started 2022 with a solid quarter. We have a winning strategy and are well
positioned to succeed, given the strength and diversity of our businesses. We are very optimistic about the
outlook for the rest of 2022 and beyond. We expect to materially benefit from a higher rate environment and
strong loan growth. Our capital markets business is well positioned as markets stabilize, and we are very excited
about the opportunity to grow our business in the New York Metro region as we integrate and build on HSBC and
Investors. We will continue to focus on execution in building a top-performing bank that delivers for all our
stakeholders.
With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.

Okay. Thank you, John. Operator, let's open it up for some Q&A.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper
Sandler. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I was hoping maybe you could spend just a moment discussing sort of the magnitude of recovery you're assuming
in the capital markets environment in the forward guide. It looks like you assume some recovery in the second
quarter but, of course, moderated the full year target a bit. Just curious for some thoughts or color on how you see
things trajecting from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go ahead and start off on that. I mean I think you had a number of impacts there that we're building into
the guide. I'd say that we mentioned our $100 million guide over guide, which is driven primarily by mortgage. But
there's some capital markets implications there as well, given the fact that 1Q we have some pull forward into the
fourth quarter. If you look back at the fourth quarter, we had a record quarter. But our pipelines look excellent.
And so there could be a little bit of time to build that back into delivering in the last three quarters of the year. But
as markets stabilize, we really think that the momentum there is strong. And so maybe Don can cover...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think it's a tale of a couple of different cities. So one thing we're seeing is quite a bit of strength in the loan
markets, the syndicated loan markets. So while the bond markets are particularly high yield and the equity
markets have been pretty much closed for the last few months, we're seeing some rotation into the syndicated
loan markets as liquidity there kind of rebuild. And you've seen quite a dramatic rally in the loan markets over the
last couple of days actually, and that's been quite supportive. So I think the second quarter will be really a story
about syndicated lending. And then if we get a reduction in volatility, we think we're going to begin to see the bond
markets reopen a little bit and the equity markets reopen.
I will say what John said, which is our pitch activity, our pipelines and are mandates are extremely strong. And so
it's really a matter of waiting for the constructiveness in the markets to return, and then we'll begin to bring deals.
And we saw three or four deals start to emerge last week, which we were on, and we feel pretty good about
particularly the back half of the year.

Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
The other thing you didn't mention is the M&A pipeline, which I think still looks really, really good. And again there,
if the markets stabilize a little bit, I think we'll start to pull those deals through. And it's typically seasonal but the
fourth quarter is huge, which it was for us in 2021. And then the first quarter is usually softer seasonally. Pipelines
look good. And I think as the year goes, we should see a nice build in M&A revenue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll also just amplify that, Bruce, to say a lot of our capital markets and M&A activity surrounds private
equity. So private equity is still flush with cash, and they actually are looking at quite interesting valuations in the
market right now. So it's a matter of matching sellers' kind of desires and buyers' desires, and that will just take a
little time to kind of work through the system.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Wonderful. That's good color. Thank you. And then, John, I was hoping you could talk just a bit about how your
rate sensitivity changes as the cycle progresses. Meaning effectively, how do the first few rate hikes look in your
mind versus the next several?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
So did you say asset sensitivity? Or was it Fed? I missed it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
In other words, how much more powerful are the first few rate hikes than the next few?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean I'd say that the – we mentioned our $20 million to $25 million per instantaneous 25 basis points rate
hike and that's really an average. So you get a little more on the front and maybe a little less as you get to the end
of it. And that's really driven by deposit betas, which are going to be extremely well controlled in the first 100, and
then that starts to build into the second 100 and then beyond. So yeah, I think you will see possibly a bit more on
the front end when we're seeing those – that lag effect in deposit betas contribute a touch more and then a little
and then it will be a little lower on the back end.
I will mention this the other point, that $20 million to $25 million is an average, but it's also a first year average.
And so there's actually more upside when you get into – even if it's instantaneous, you still get a lag effect benefit
from the asset side as well as assets reprice. So you might see, for example, in year two, even for an
instantaneous 25 basis point change, you would see upside from there in the 15% to 20% range on top of that as
you getting to roll in year two.

Perfect. All right. Thank you very much.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thank you so much for a slide 7. And I guess, John, maybe let me start my line of questioning here. So your
current asset sensitivity from here is percent pro forma for Investors. I guess I want to understand the comment
that Bruce made earlier about acceleration, right? So on one hand, we do expect deposit betas to accelerate as
we are deeper into the rate cycle. But on the other hand, you have some swaps on your portfolio today. Can you
talk a bit about the interplay of both? And how should we think of this asset sensitivity as we move forward in the
rate cycle? And does the swap portfolio give you a different trajectory for enhanced sensitivity later?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I think if you're on page 7, I mean, I think that the drivers there are that we're entering this
cycle but much better positioned than the last cycle. When you think about just the starting point with interest-
bearing deposit costs being at 10 basis points an all-time low for us, we started the last cycle at 34 basis points
and a balance sheet position, the mix on the deposit side is much better with 32% non-interest bearing. So we
feel just much better prepared to benefit from rising rates this time around. We still benefited from rising rates last
time around, by the way, but we're much better prepared to benefit from this side around – this time around on
deposit betas, given all the strength on the balance sheet.
I think when you ask about balance sheet, I mean, I think – and swaps, you really have to think about in the
context of the entire balance sheet. So we do have a significant amount of asset sensitivity left to play out. That
will decline over time as NII keeps rising, as I mentioned in my remarks. The denominator effect as we as we
update and increase our NII, that alone reduces the percentage further benefit that could occur for future rate
hikes. Just dollar for dollar is fine but the percentages fall. But I do think that there is significant firepower left both
with respect to the balance sheet, loan growth part of the story as well as much more hedging left to do before
asset sensitivity gets anywhere near neutral. So that's how I would describe it.
I mean in terms of deposit betas, again, 2022, you're going to see a lot of lag, a lot of lag in the first 100. It will
start to catch up maybe in the second 100. And then if we really do get to 300 basis points in Fed funds, you'll see
some of that catch up in 2023. And then I'll just close out with our conversation about NII being up $290 million to
$330 million guide over guide is an important thing to focus on, and that's on a gradual rate rising scenario. It may
be – it could be it's much higher in a full year effect when you get to 2023, approaching maybe 2x that.

And I would just add, Erika, that we've been, I think, very keen to leave the asset sensitivity high and not do
significant additional swaps. We've done a bit. But anyway, we're still, I think, of the view that rates could go even
higher here. So feel good about how we're positioned right now.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And the second question is for you, Bruce. The stock is having a good start to the day, but the valuation on
tangible book value is underneath your ROTCE landing point for the year, either on a stand-alone or a pro forma
basis. I guess what do you think in your estimation that the market doesn't understand about the improvements
that the bank has made since the IPO? And wondering I think part of that is the asset sensitivity and deposits.
Wondering if you could answer that question the way however where you want to. But also, could you give us a
sense of how much checking accounts you have, for example, on the consumer side versus previous? And
maybe remind us why you have to keep what seems like a 50 basis point to 100 basis point higher capital level
than a lot of your regional peers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. There's a lot in that. I'll try to unpack that, Erika. But I think partly the – our objective here is to continue to
perform well through cycles, and so we're a relatively new company with a relatively fresh management team.
And so I think when the market goes into a risk-off posture, some assumptions of how are they going to do, we're
not as – we don't have the historical track record of some of our peers, I think. I think we've done a good job of
dispelling some of those worry beads when we went through the pandemic, and our credit performance was very
good. I think there was some concern for a while that we've grown the balance sheet fairly quickly to get
releveraged after the IPO and was that going to end in tears. And we've said all along that we've been very
disciplined in terms of where we were lending money and how we were allocating capital, and I think that's borne
fruit.
I think now with an upcycle at the beginning of the year, when the environment looked like rates were going to go
up gradually, to use a Goldilocks example, that was the porridge was just right scenario. And so our stock
performed quite well out of the chute. I think once it became clear that the Fed was behind the curve and was
going to start to raise rates much more aggressively, I think then you kind of tipped into, well, maybe the porridge
is too hot, and will our deposit betas go up too fast and curtail some of the benefits from higher rates. And I think,
again, with all the work we've done and analysis we've provided, we're quite confident that the liability side of this
bank is much, much better than it's ever been. We've done a lot of hard work on that. And so we still think,
whether the path is fast or whether it's more gradual, we're going to benefit significantly in terms of interest rates.
I'd say also on fees, there's probably a concern that we've built up some areas that maybe are more volatile in
capital markets and mortgage is kind of a big fee element for us. Having said that, I think you've seen that there's
good diversity in our fees. And so in a pandemic period when capital markets were a bit softer, mortgage
revenues were really, really strong, given lower rates. And we can see that flip around. But I think the fact that
we've assembled an excellent commercial bank with very strong capabilities and a targeted focus on private
capital and serving private capital and helping the industries that are really are the engine of the economy,
technology, healthcare with our JMP acquisition, I think we're very confident that we can grow revenues
sustainably. And capital markets, they'll move around a little bit from quarter to quarter. But I think the trend line is
upwards and to the right.
And again, on the mortgage business, I think we've built that out to have a nice diversity of revenues across
wholesale channels and our retail channel. I think we can combat some of the lower production volumes by
building market share. So we plan to hire more fellows this year. So I think all of these aspects take time for the
market to come around and fully appreciate, and we'll just keep doing what we're doing and putting up good
results and executing well. And then I think ultimately the stock will take care of itself.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
With respect to the non-interest bearing liabilities, I mean the DDAs as a percentage of the total deposit base is
up to about 32%. I think when I walked in the door at the time of the IPO, that was probably in the low 20s. So
that's been a dramatic improvement, focusing on total value proposition to certain target customer segments on
the consumer side and then also on the commercial side, actually just building out our capabilities and investing in
our core platform and cash management offering. And so it's just been a gradual improvement over time as we've
enhanced our capabilities and our targeting, and we've had nice growth as a result.
So I think I'll stop there. Does anybody want to add to that? Brendan, do you want to talk about consumer
deposits or, Don, on commercials?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Executive Vice President & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'm happy to give a – Erika, you asked about sort of accounts – of checking account customers. Just a
couple of quick points. When you look at total relationships in the consumer bank, when we went public, we had
about 2.9 million to 3 million customers. We now have over 7 million customers in total. Now some of those are
loan customers. So when you unpack that to core deposit customers, that number is sort of we went from 2.9
million to 3.5 million customers. So that's good growth. But that's really not where the action is in the story versus
sort of heading down this path. Really under the covers on that growth, which we've been in sort of top quartile
growth of our peers, has been a quality transformation.
So, there has been a dramatic overhaul in how many customers view us as their primary bank. And more than
100% of the growth in the household base has come from mass affluent and affluent customers. So, when you
combine the higher quality customer with deeper relationships, that's what's driving a lot of the improvement in
DDA and non-interest bearing deposits which is very sustainable. That's kind of ground game, a lot of work over
multiple quarters over a lot of years to get that to scale. And, look, we still have some running room. I think there's
still oxygen left in that tank for us to continue to improve the quality of the customer base.
We've made a lot of progress in catching up to peers, but we still have momentum. It does not seem to be
slowing. I think you should expect more and more of that, putting aside what happens with the excess stimulus
deposits. I think, under the coverage, the quality story is still continuing and continuing at scale.
The other point I'd make – mentioned of as you think about betas for this upcycle, last time, because of the low
DDA balances that we had in consumer, we had about $10 billion in CDs. Now we start that period with only $3
billion. And we look a lot more like a bigger sized bank in terms of deposit composition than we do a smaller size
bank where we're not as rate sensitive in how we're driving deposit because of that quality transformation that you
see in the customer base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll just emphasize, Bruce, what you said in terms of – we've gone through a complete reconstruction of our
treasury service business. It was frankly a basket case six years ago. And now, I would put it up against any other
companies' treasury service business. And that's driving an above trend growth rate, 7% to 10% in terms of year-
on-year growth and also driving a skew towards non-interest bearing deposits. And we didn't even have a deposit
team six years ago. And now we have a built-out team, which has got fantastic analytics, bringing new offerings
like green deposits on the ESG agenda and also building a liquidity portal. So, it's in a totally different place and
we're seeing results in terms of deposit levels and we're seeing the skew towards non-interest bearing also.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So we're giving you a long-winded answer, Erika, but I wanted to just come back to the last thing you
touched on which was ROTCE and also our capital targets. So, I think we're pleased that we can say that will be
solidly in the range for our medium-term targets this year of the 14% to 16%. And you can see that where we
were in the first quarter, that should ramp. And so, we could be even stronger, I think, as we exit the year. So, we
feel very good about that.
We did move the targets from 9.75% to 10% to 9.5% to 10%. So we moved them modestly. I'm still a big believer
in being somewhat conservative on the capital particularly. As I said, we're a relatively new company. And so, I
think all our stakeholders take some comfort from maybe being slightly higher than our peers. But if you look at it
over time, we've been converging to peers. And honestly, when you look at the CCAR results and our risk profile,
there's no reason that, longer term, we'll need to have that premium.

Brian Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Hey, good morning. Maybe to follow up on deposits, you've been very clear and convincing on the improvement in
the books. So, that's appreciated and great information. As you think also about the ability to grow deposits over
the next two years, I wonder – I know there's a lot of moving parts. There's no one answer. But if you could just
give your thoughts on the ability to grow deposits overall and maybe touch on consumer versus commercial and
how that might behave as rates go up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Great question, Brian. Appreciate it. I think that you basically look at excellent opportunities to grow
deposits over time as our product lineup on both consumer and commercial have improved. And I think if you
separate the expectation for – as rates rise, there's some impact on how those deposits play out and there's also
the surge deposits that came in, in the pandemic that all appear to be a lot stickier than maybe a lot of us thought
when they first showed up. I do think more broadly, when you think about the macro, deposits have grown
consistently over the last several decades under a number of different macroeconomic scenarios.
Even through quantitative tightening and the like, the banking industry deposit growth seems to continue to chug
along. So, we're optimistic that the industry as a whole and we, in particular, given our significantly expanded
product capabilities, we'll be able to continue to drive really strong deposit growth on both consumer and
commercial side. So maybe I'll just turn it over to Brendan and then maybe Don.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Brendan Coughlin A
Executive Vice President & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Look, I think we've demonstrated, in a variety of cycles, the ability to drive deposits at scale. The question
is always at what cost? And I think we're in a dramatically different position in this upcycle than we were certainly
in the last upcycle. We continue to make improvements sort of on the consumer side, starting with just the
breadth of the levers that we've built, whether it's the Citizens Access platform nationally to raise deposits away
from our core book, the new markets that we're entering, where we've got a solid and stable deposit base, but we
think there's a lot of running room.
In fact, we're starting to see early signs already of – we've got $100 million in inflow of balance sales already in
the New York market from great execution and solid sales. So we're optimistic continuing and going forward, that
can continue. And as we bring and convert the customer base from Investors closely as they went into the
platform, we think that same opportunity will exist in New Jersey.
And then, our analytics have improved materially over the last couple years, which allows us to be even more
targeted. And when you marry that with what I said a minute ago around just the quality and engagement of our
customer base, the confidence of being able to grow deposits with highly engaged customers at more market
rates than needing to reach for promo rates is high. So, I feel really good that we'll be able to grow at the pace we
need with a much more moderate cost.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll just – I think I said a lot of it in the last comment around treasury services and the growth of that
business. But also remember, we're expanding aggressively in terms of our client base. So, we're in expansion
markets. We're adding a lot of clients and with that comes the opportunity to gather deposits at reasonable costs.
So we feel pretty good about it.
But I'll go back to what Brendan said also, it's really a matter of the day-to-day balancing of volume versus cost
and managing that against the asset side of the balance sheet and where we can redeploy capital. So it's
something that we managed carefully, but I feel confident that we're going to continue to expand the deposit base.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Two questions. One was just on the most recent conversation that we had on deposit growth. I was intrigued by
that relative to Bruce, your comment about flowing resi and auto lending growth to – I don't know if this is the right
word, but keep the LDR, protect the LDR at around the 83% level. So I guess I just wanted to understand if that
comment about LDR was more about the deposit growth rate that you were talking to just now or was that
because of the just opportunities in resi and auto that you're not seeing as much as maybe you have had over the
past few quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'd say it's a kind of a factor of a number of considerations. One is that we're already seeing very strong
loan demand on the commercial side. We're seeing line utilization tick up. So, there can be somewhat of a
rotation over into more growth on commercial. Therefore, when we look at consumer and in that higher rate
environment, some of the margins on the lending in areas like auto and mortgage aren't what they used to be.
And so, we can still get to the loan growth assumptions that we had coming into the year with that rotation up to
more commercial and throttling back a little bit on the consumer side.
And we could keep the pedal to the floor and keep pushing on bringing in those consumer assets, but we think we
don't need to do that at this point. We've got NIM going up. The rate hikes is providing a big lift. And if the
marginal return on that incremental lending in the consumer side for mortgage and auto isn't hitting our hurdles,
then we have no problem backing off that. The net result of that is that benefits the LDR versus keeping the pedal
to the floor. So we think that's a trade-off worth taking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then just, your – I guess the underlying question is how high up are you willing for LDR to go? And
then I also had just a quick question just on yields in general. This past quarter, you had some nice uplift in resi
and the securities book, other retail loans. And I'm just wondering, was that a function of swap activity that drove
up those yields QQ? Or was there – it didn't look like the balances would have driven that QQ. So just wondering
how do you approach what's there. Thanks.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Let me start off and then maybe John and Brendan can add on the yield question. But we've been – historically
since the IPO, we've had a relatively higher LDR that we worked hard to bring down from the high 90s down into
the mid-90s. And then with this big influx of liquidity into the market, we've been able to bring the LDR back down
to 80-ish and it's inching up a little bit here with all the loan growth that we're experiencing. I think we should still
be able to manage that in the 80s. I can't really call exactly where that is likely to be, partly depends on the
amount of loan growth that we see. But I think just the way we over time brought it from high 90s down into mid-
90s and I think we can take another step function here with all the liquidity that we have in the house and continue
to manage that in a reasonably conservative position with lots of liquidity. So that would be my answer there.
John, maybe you want to pick up the yields?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll start off on securities and maybe Brendan can take mortgage. But I can tell you overall that it's not
swamp activity that's having an impact on either of those. And as it relates to securities, just to give you a sense,
there's two dynamics going on there. One is the front book where current yields on the stuff going into the portfolio
are north of 3%. So we're in the 300 basis point to 330 basis point range. That's a driver in 1Q. It wasn't at that
level during 1Q but it was well over 2%. It was probably 230 basis point to 250 basis point during the first quarter,
and that was compared to maybe 175 basis points in 4Q. So that's the dynamic you're seeing, 175 basis points in
4Q, 230-ish basis points in 1Q and now it's over 3%. So that will continue into the second quarter.
But the other dynamic is the back book premium amortization tends – it declines when rates rise. So you're
seeing the tailwind from that into the securities book. And so that's the driver there. And maybe Brendan can talk
about mortgages.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Executive Vice President & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. There's a handful of things on the consumer side. So on other retail, there's a good percentage of that book
that's variable linked to the market with our merchant partners and such. And you can see that kind of ramp up as
the market changes. On the resi side, we're obviously a very big lender in HELOC, which is essentially all
variable. And we've had four sequential quarters in a row in net balance sheet growth, and I believe we're the
number one originator in all of the United States in HELOCs. We're really striking while the iron hot and taking
advantage of that business. So you're seeing that flow through in the resi book with the yield improvements there
as the rates kind of march north.
On the mortgage side, so a couple of things. One is front book pricing. We've been disciplined on front book
pricing to the point of being a little out of the market at times as the market lags capacity. But we're going to make
sure we're using our balance sheet for deep relationships and try to push our rates up as fast as we can with the
market. The other just technical dynamic that you're seeing, if you're looking at linked quarter on mortgages in Q4,
we did have a one-time reserve adjustment to the yields in Q4 that is non-recurring and didn't happen in Q1. So if
you look back a couple of quarters, you'll see a little bit of noise on what we saw in Q4. But that's kind of gone.
That's sort of washed out. So we should start to see the mortgage book begin to climb with the percentage of that
book that isn't variable rate and continued expected discipline on front book pricing.

now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I was hoping you guys could remind us with Investors. Is there any portion of the loan book or
securities book that you're looking to kind of de-emphasize or run off?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll just start off there. I mean I think that the securities book at Investors looks as a profile that we would
migrate and, frankly, have already been migrating to our profile, which is mostly clean duration plus mortgage-
backed securities, agency-type paper. So we've been in the process of migrating the securities book on that front.
In general, we like the loan book that comes over from Investors has performed well from a credit perspective.
They have a nice core portfolio over there. Maybe Don could talk about anything else that might be migrated at
the margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. There are certain elements of the book that might be a little bit different as we move forward, but it's not
going to be quick and aggressive. We're going to do it – we're going to migrate it over time. But a lot of the
business that they do is very diversifying for us. They're in different elements of the CRE business than we are.
So it looks quite different. And then a lot of the C&I businesses is smaller company business banking, and we're
looking to grow that segment as we move forward. So you'll see some adjustment at the margin but no aggressive
asset sales, I think, out of the blocks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Other than, I will say, Matt, on my side, we are doing roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion of DSO adjustments on the
Citizens side, and you'll see us do some of that as we move around low-yielding assets that we might be
acquiring. But we don't have full plans on that yet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then I guess, obviously, there's some opportunities as well to potentially cross-sell. But as we think about
layering in Investors to the kind of medium term, do you think it will have any net impact as we think about your
loan growth, either a little bit less than Citizen stand-alone or a little bit more or roughly the same?

John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Well, I mean, I look at it as what Don and Brendan have been able to accomplish when we go into expansion
markets, right, in particular, Don's business in commercial. When we enter the Southeast, it's a good playbook for
how we've been able to grow those expansion markets a little faster for a period of time until it converges over
time. So I think you would expect that once we get the engine running with respect to all of the integration and
conversion, and we've been able to make our investments that we plan to make in New York Metro. I would
suspect for a number of years, you could see the growth rates once that all settles out and baselines. You could
see those growth rates actually being higher than Citizens stand-alone for a number of years until it balances out
in terms of the expected market share that we plan to take in that Metro.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, John, I'll also add that they have a very limited product set on the C&I side. So bringing in the variety of
products that we can offer and capabilities that we can offer, we think there's an opportunity to go after larger
companies and also serve their clients in a much more substantial way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Executive Vice President & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, same comment on the consumer side. Our product set is significantly more diversified than both HSBC and
Investors, which is great, and we didn't build those revenue synergies into the deal model. So we're seeing early
signs of significant sales opportunity in New York. We're delivering on that. We're starting marketing middle of the
year. We're going to convert early on mortgage and wealth for Investors inside of 2022, and then the rest of the
platform will convert in 2023. So it will take some time, but we see an outsized opportunity for sustainable revenue
growth over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Let me just chime in here as well is that we think these deals are going to be a big success. And it's really
not just the expense synergies, which we're going to go get. But if it's a big success, it means that we were
successful in cross-selling more to the customers who haven't had the benefit of our broader products and
services and then just gain market share. And I think we have some very clear ideas about how to go after that,
both on the commercial side and the consumer side. And really, none of that has been put into our forward
forecasts at this point. So our goal would be like within three to five years, if New York starts to take on a look and
feel of what we built in Boston and what we built in Philadelphia, it's going to be a home run for us.

Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. That's a good question. I mean I think the first thing I would say, when you're saying blended, if you were
speaking about Investors on a blended basis, I think that their profile is actually quite good. And when you look
back in different cycles, their loss rates actually are lower than not only ours, but the regional bank peer set and
given the collateralization, et cetera, and a number of other things that help that profile. So pound for pound, they
come on with a slightly lower ACL and CECL hit to what a CFG stand-alone is. It's not by a lot and they're smaller,
so it won't have a huge impact. But they come in a little lower than, call it, the 1.43% where we are. So from that
perspective, it gives you a sense for how that might cause us to tick down on a blended basis. CECL day one was
1.47%. We're at 1.43%. We've cleaned out a lot of the portfolios of concern that might have existed back at the
end of 2019 when CECL was adopted.
And there's been significant, as we mentioned earlier, and we have in the slide deck in the appendix, significant
improvements in both commercial and kind of retail businesses since then. So you could see some opportunity all
else equal for back book needs as long as the macro holds for those needs to tick down. I think all of the
variability will be on loan growth. And so we're just going to provide for our loan growth and all-in probably be a
little lower than we are here but not by a lot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
The other wildcard, obviously, Ken, is what does the kind of long term or the medium term macro forecast look
like? And can the Fed engineer a soft landing if there's a higher possibility of recession, which could change that
dynamic somewhat? But I think certainly right now with respect to 2022, we feel really good about our position
from a credit standpoint. And I would – if you ask me to make a call, I'd say it's unlikely we'll have a recession in
2022. So at least the clean credit metrics should continue for a while. Whether we can still show net benefits on
the provision line, I think those days are probably numbered. But in any case, I think there's still going to be good
numbers. And as John said, the ACL may tick down a little more from here, but we're kind of starting to feel like
we're not going to go a huge amount lower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. And Bruce, as a follow-up to that, it was good – nice to see the commercial line utilization up 150 basis
points. You talked about you're reiterating your full year loan growth guidance. Just wondering if you can give us
some on-the-ground color about business activity, supply chain constraints, just in terms of – and also the trade-
off possibly between loans going on the balance sheet versus out the door in capital markets. And just kind of a
feel for just how the commercial side of the economy is feeling and how that influences your views on commercial
growth. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Let me just say a word and then Don really has the best color. But clearly, it's nice to see the line utilization
pick up. Some of it is a little defensive in nature, so people have been worried about their supply chain and
inventory levels. And so when they can get a hold of the materials that they need, they go out and buy it. So I'd
say inventory build in light of supply chain issues probably has been the biggest driver. And a little of that also is
20


Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
(CFG) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
inflation, which is causing those materials to cost more. So that would be, I'd say, number one. There's still people
doing deals, doing smaller deals and playing offense in terms of growth. There's a little bit of that ticking in as well.
I think what continues to give us confidence is the thing that Don mentioned earlier, that there's private capital has
amassed tons of firepower to put to work in the markets and is looking to get deals done. And so there's still deal-
related activity that should continue to fuel some loan growth. But with that, let me turn it over to Don.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So I think you covered most of it. And back to the second half of the question, a lot of the capital markets
activity we do is in the leveraged buyout area and things like that. So that's an origination for distribution business,
which it should be. We don't want a lot of that on our balance sheet, and we continue to maintain average holds of
about $12 million in our sponsor business. So very diversified, very careful from a risk profile. I will say that the
utilization trend that we're seeing is actually even a little bit higher as we sit here in mid-April. So that trend really
is driven by cost of goods, so there's an inflation aspect and some of the stockpiling.
But the broader question is we're hearing generally positive things from our customers. The credit quality, as we
said, feels pretty good. There's a little bit of pressure on margins as companies have varying degrees of inability
to pass on cost increases where they're seeing them. But remember that these companies have been through hell
over the last two years with the pandemic. And they've cut their costs. They've restructured their businesses. And
they're entering whatever we're entering, whether it be a slowdown or something that's just slower growth, in a
much better position from a management standpoint that they were just two years ago. So that gives us a lot of
confidence.
And certain clients are being optimistic, where they're seeing – as Bruce said, where they're seeing competitors
that are slightly weakened, we're seeing a little bit of M&A activity in the middle market channels that companies
are buying each other.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
The one last thing you might also add, Don, is on the subscription line financing and some of the securitization for
private equity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So we're seeing significant volume in our subscription line financing for private equity and significant
volume in our asset-backed securities businesses in the warehouses. So, those markets are very strong and we
continue to see growth in the loan books on both of those activities.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. I appreciate the color you gave there in terms of the commercial drivers and the trend behind the
demand. Are you able to perhaps help unpack the high-single-digit loan growth expectation ex the deals and ex
PPP for 2022 in terms of how you think about C&I growth and perhaps growth in your CRE portfolio as well?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So, why don't I start with that? So, we're down to basically almost nothing on the C&I side on PPP. So,
that's in the rearview mirror. So, that's not in any of our loan growth projections. The loan growth that we've
referenced is really CFG loan growth. We've assumed a little bit of growth on the Investors' bank side, but not a
lot for the rest of 2022.
So, all the comments we're making are CFG specific. I would say subscription lines are growing the fastest. C&I is
growing the second fastest. And CRE, we're seeing very, very modest growth. And we're basically on our CRE
business really still focused on purpose-built office, industrial and life science and a little bit on multifamily, but not
a lot. We're really off-risk on hospitality and retail. So, not a lot of CRE business there.
The issue that we're fighting and continue to fight, although it's getting a little bit better, is our originations are
really strong. We're seeing lots of activity, both coming into the book and also in the pipelines. But pay-downs
have been quite high and this was the first quarter where we saw pay-downs begin to decline. Maybe that's a little
bit of the volatility in the capital markets. Maybe that's a little bit of the loan market aggressiveness right now. But
we're seeing a little bit of a benefit from lower pay-downs, which were running very, very high last year for almost
the whole year and really eating up a lot of the origination activity that we're seeing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, separately, on the credit side, just have a question there. In terms of the
increase in the NPAs and the increase in the 90-day delinquencies, I know you indicated that's mainly mortgage
coming off forbearance. Just want to give you – if you can give us a little color in terms of your confidence there in
terms of the resolution of those items. And then, separately, any signs of a faster-than-expected credit
normalization on the consumer side, perhaps in your merchant partnerships or anything? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Executive Vice President & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. It's Brendan. I can take that. On the mortgage side, look, this is fully expected. These are sort of an
administrative move of customers that have been in forbearance for quite some time. We've done extensive
analytics on how much loss exposure we have to folks that are coming off of forbearance on to a full repayment
schedule and it's de minimis, especially in the mortgage side, we've got very significant coverage on our loan to
value and so we feel really confident in that.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Just broadly on the consumer book, we haven't seen much of any early signs that we're starting to see a tick up
and return to normal. We're expecting one, but the delinquency levels generally remain in very strong spot and
significantly depressed. Some of the newer portfolios that we've talked a lot about over the years on these calls
and others around student loans and merchant point of sale maintained incredible strength and have not shown
any signs of uptick in early delinquency whatsoever. So, we feel really confident around the outlook. The state of
credit and consumer is at the lowest levels that's ever been. And we continue to sort of beat to the positive almost
every month on what we're seeing on NCOs. So, I feel really good.
And I think – and when you look at the other side of the ledger for the average consumer, they're still showing a
lot of excess liquidity. The money in consumer checking accounts are still at all-time highs, really hasn't moved
down. While we're seeing a lot of velocity in customers using credit cards and spending and paying for things, it's
not adding to outstanding.
So, in order to believe that you'll start to see a meaningful correction on the credit line, I think you'd have to see
some deflation on the excess cash built-up in the consumers' wallet and start to see a rebound in receivables
building up on the credit cards. So, we haven't seen that. So, all the early indicators just aren't moving yet. Of
course, we do expect it will. But just right now, it's not. So, we'll take it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I'd just add to that, John, is all the early warning signs are flashing green, which is great. So, on the consumer
side, delinquency roll rates, some of the things Brendan quoted, all appear really, really good. Similarly, on the
commercial side, the credit class ratio continues to go down and the heightened – there's very few credits that are
in heightened monitoring. So that also bodes well for the future. You can – at these very low levels for things like
charge-offs and NPAs, you can see kind of one item can kind of move that number around a little bit. But overall,
we feel really, really positive about the outlook for credit for certainly the balance of this year.

line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Thanks. I was just curious, are there any plans to manage the available for sale securities portfolio just given the
rising rates? Or any plans to move any of it into like held to maturity or hedge some of this?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. It's a good question. I mean I think we're in about a little bit less than 10%, call it, high single digits with
HTM in the first quarter. I think you'll see that, that number will rise in the second quarter based upon a number of
things that we're doing. We've put a lot – we're putting a lot of securities to work just in CFG standalone just given
the environment now that there's a highly attractive place to grow the securities book at north of 300% yields just
on standalone.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
And then, of course, we've closed on the acquisition of Investors and there's about $4 billion of securities there
that we're rotating out of the profile that they had into the profile that looks like the kinds of securities that we own.
So, there's lots of opportunities to address that and you're likely to see the HTM percentage rise in the second
quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then, so, secondly, just on the HSBC acquisition, I think at the time of the announcement in
May, there was about $9 billion in deposits and you closed it with $6.3 billion in deposits. Do you think at these
levels, deposits hold steady, you can grow them? Just that – if you could just talk about that change in the
outlook.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Executive Vice President & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. A pre-legal day one, the rundown in deposits is principally driven by their online business and a segment of
international customers that we're rotating into banks that have more global capabilities. And so, the good news
on that is that we didn't have to pay a premium of any kind for those customers that we weren't really going to
consider core. We had modeled in essentially twice the level of deposit attrition post-legal day one than you would
normally expect in a deal like that, given the profile of the customers that were banking at HSBC.
The good news is since legal day one, it looks like a lot of that attrition had accelerated pre-legal day one. And
we've seen the portfolio at a broadly stable level with good sales, very strong sales and normal expected ins and
outflows on the back book. And so, we do expect that to be stable now and start to get into growth mode as we
ramp up our marketing activities, which would obviously be a bit of a benefit on the deal model side offsetting
some of the shortfall in deposits we got on legal day one. So we feel really, really good on the early signs that
we're seeing, here we are, six or seven weeks in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I was just going to add, given we had the transition pre-legal day one, that we don't have to pay for it and it
produces the trend with the attrition happening post-legal day one. I just wanted to add that data point.

John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Bruce, you said in your opening comments that obviously the focus this year is to integrate the acquisition you did
in the Metro New York marketplace. But in the wealth space, if something was priced right, that would be
something you'd consider. Thinking about the Florida franchise as you build that out, if a depository came up at
attractive pricing, and again I know you've played this full with what you're doing in New York. Is that something
that you could consider? Or really, no, we're going to wait until we get these things fully integrated before we
consider a depository deal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I don't see us looking at a depository there any time soon. I think we've got enough on our plate that getting
off to this really great start and launching New York Metro is job one. We do have a strategy in Florida that I think
is interesting. So we had a couple of de novo wealth centers, one in Palm Beach and one in Naples, that we've
focused on launching and starting to get those to the right customer levels and the right staffing so that we can
really make some traction in those markets. And then we had five or six come over from HSBC, very attractive
locations and branches with good staffing in the Miami area.
And so again, that's job one is to try to really make that work, what we have, and really drive up the performance
of those sites and keep getting smart on the market, keep talking to people, keep trying to figure out kind of where
would the next city be where we think we could come in and make an entrance and gain some share. So that's to
me the focus. And we'll keep trying to get smart in the market, but let's digest what we have and make that
productive.
The other point I'd make with respect to Florida and elsewhere where we're kind of outside of our core footprint is
we're investing heavily in the digital bank. And very recently, we've migrated to a new cloud-based core platform,
which is really exciting for us, and it's going to unlock the ability for us to really broaden our offerings and integrate
those offerings on the digital platform. And so that's kind of also twinned with some light branches in markets like
Florida, can we really start to bang the opportunity through our digital platforms. And then over time, we'll figure
out what physical presence do we need to complement those digital offerings. So it's pretty exciting.
We have a similar opportunity in the greater Washington area where we picked up, I think, it's 9 or 10 branches
from HSBC. So we can try to attack that market through digital and decide is nine or ten the right number. Are
they in the right locations? Do we need to alter that? And then using test and learning from Florida and from D.C.,
are there some other attractive cities where we might want to go next and really put effort into growing the digital
presence combined with some thin branch presence?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good, Bruce. And to pivot, the next question is on deposits. How do you guys weigh – you talked about how
certificates of deposits have come down dramatically. You've got a very strong DVA balance core now, much
higher than when you went public, of course. But with rates moving up so quickly now, the 10 year is almost at
3% today. When does long-term funding with low-cost CDs make sense? And then, Don, when do your
25


Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
(CFG) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
customers start asking for higher compensating balances as rates move up? Have you guys seen more
discussions there as well on the compensating balances on the commercial side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go ahead and start, a couple of thoughts there. I mean I think as you heard from Brendan earlier and you
saw on our slide 7, our CD portfolio was much smaller than it was before and what that – at the start. And I think
what the point there is, is that CDs could be part of the story and – but we would do it in a way that's connected to
a deep customer relationship rather than sort of a pseudo wholesale funding approach, which is, I think, how
things got played out early in the last cycle for us. Whereas this cycle, it's all going to be about customer
relationships.
I think the other thing to keep in mind is that over the last cycle, we expect CD betas to be lower during the cycle
in part due to how quickly you think the cycle is going to go. The last cycle took a longer time, two to three years,
and so you kept getting that ratcheted up cost to CDs every time they came to maturity. So I do think CD is going
to be part of the story. Given deep customer relationships and a shorter cycle, CDs can absolutely be something
of a tool that we'll utilize coming off a lower base. So that's the first point.
And the second point is that on the commercial side, you will have balance migration that's natural as
compensating balances don't need to be quite as high to – as earnings credit rates actually rise over time. So
yeah, there will be some of that migration that's built into the deposit betas that we articulated earlier and built into
our deposit costs overall. And so – but it's the same point there, that given the number of ways that we can
interact with our customers on the commercial side, we're deepening our relationships there and expect that those
migrations will be well controlled and as expected.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I think that's exactly right, and we've actually gone out over the last month or so with a full core
information package with all of our bankers to discuss deposit and pricing levels as part of the overall relationship
with all of our relationship managers. So we're well on top of it. We have had some people pull deposits, but we
haven't had a problem backfilling in and bringing in other deposits to basically cover any outflows.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thank you for the color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and your support. Have a great day. Thank you.
