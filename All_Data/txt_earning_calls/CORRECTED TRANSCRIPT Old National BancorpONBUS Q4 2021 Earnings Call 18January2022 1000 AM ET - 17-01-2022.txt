Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning and happy New Year. We are pleased to host our call to discuss our 2021 results and update on
our pending partnership with First Midwest Bank.
Let's start on slide 4. We are pleased to share our full-year 2021 results. I would categorize this year's results as
better than planned. 2021 EPS was $1.67, adjusted EPS was $1.73 with an adjusted net income of more than

$286 million. Our adjusted return on average tangible common equity was north of 15% and our adjusted
efficiency ratio was approximately 57%. Highlights include7% commercial loan growth driven by record
commercial production of $3.9 billion, coupled with net recoveries of $4.8 million for the year.
We also saw record wealth management revenues in 2021. I'm particularly pleased that commercial loans are
now up 20% in total from 2019 levels, excluding the impact of PPP. That's significant growth amid a global
pandemic, and we've maintained a consistently strong credit profile in the process. We've opportunistically leaned
in when several of our competitors froze, and we continue to benefit from that stance, taking share by doing what
we do best, consistent quality growth.
Moving to slide 5, our fourth quarter EPS was $0.34. Adjusted EPS was $0.37. We saw strong commercial loan
production of $1.1 billion during the quarter and excellent credit quality. Our pipeline ended the year at a robust
$2.5 billion.
A quick update on hiring. We opportunistically added significant talent during the quarter, especially on our
commercial and wealth management teams. Building upon our recent success in St. Louis, we've hired two
industry veterans to start an LPO in Kansas City, which should be operating at full strength later in the quarter.
We've also begun recruiting talent in Chicago, anticipating that Chicago and Minneapolis will be a significant focus
in 2022. In summary, our talent pipeline remains strong. I am personally active in recruiting key team members
and we will continue to make these vital investments throughout the year.
Moving to slide 6, which contains a quick refresher on some of our accomplishments and next steps with our
partnership with First Midwest. As you know, both companies have tremendous integration history and
experience, and as a result, our work is going very well. We have decision and communicated the organizational
structure and leadership positions for all client segments and support areas. We've also settled on our core
processing system and supporting applications. Our team member excitement – our team members' [ph]
engagement and excitement (04:00) remained strong, and as a result, we've seen minimal client-facing roles –
minimal attrition on our client-facing roles.
Our combined leadership teams continue to meet and build a collective long-term strategy and develop tactics to
accelerate our combined growth. While we're still waiting on Federal Reserve approval, we continue to have
frequent and constructive dialogue with the Fed staff, who assure us our application is complete and ready for
review at the board level. We expect we will hear positive news this quarter. As soon as we hear, we will move
expeditiously towards the close.
With a more elongated-than-expected regulatory approval and the global pandemic-related issues affecting the
availability of labor and IT equipment, we now expect our systems to – conversion to occur in July. Given the
delayed systems conversion, we expect to achieve closer to 50% of the run rate savings we modeled in 2022. We
still expect to achieve 100% of the original model savings of $109 million in 2023. Lastly, despite potential
distraction from the lingering pandemic-related issues and our transformational merger, we remain highly focused
on serving our clients and communities.
I think our results for the quarter and the year illustrate the success of those efforts. Our success would not have
been possible without one of the strongest teams in the industry. I'm also grateful for the hundreds of team
members who are focused on the successful integration of the combined companies.
Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to Brendon.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
Brendon B. Falconer
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Jim. Turning to slide 7, our GAAP earnings per share was $0.34 and our adjusted earnings per share
was $0.37. Adjusted earnings exclude $6.7 million in merger-related charges as well as $400,000 in debt
securities gains.
Slide 8 shows the trend in commercial loans and the related pipeline and production trends, all excluding the
impact of PPP loans. Q4 represents our sixth consecutive quarter of organic loan growth with 2021 commercial
[ph] outstanding (05:57) increasing over 7% with both CRE and C&I showing solid growth. Strong commercial
production of $1.1 billion was well-balanced across all our major markets. We're also pleased that the strong
fourth quarter production did not have a significant impact on our pipeline, which ended the year at $2.5 billion,
the highest year-end level on record. The size and quality of the pipeline that includes almost $500 million in the
accepted category, supports our optimistic outlook on loan growth heading into 2022.
Turning briefly to pricing, new money yields on C&I were 3.39%, which are now well above portfolio yields. New
CRE production yields were slightly lower for the quarter at 2.59%. More than 80% of that production is indexed to
short-term rates with good spreads but relatively low absolute coupons. While this puts some pressure on margin
in the near term, it does position us well for a rising rate environment.
The investment portfolio increased this quarter as deposit growth once again outpaced total loan growth. We
continue to put much of the excess liquidity to work in our invest portfolio. New money yields on investments
improved 18 basis point quarter-over-quarter to 1.8% with portfolio duration shorter by a [ph] quarter year (07:07).
Moving to slide 9, we again saw meaningful increases in both period end and average deposit balances.
Quarterly growth came largely from our retail clients with business clients drawing down on noninterest-bearing
accounts. Total cost of deposits for the quarter was 5 basis points while total interest-bearing liabilities was 28
basis points, both down 1 basis point from Q3.
Next on slide 10, you will see details of our net interest income and margins. Net interest income excluding PPP
decreased just $300,000, which was consistent with both our expectations and goal of maintaining stable NII
throughout this challenging rate environment. Net interest margin decreased 15 basis points from prior quarter to
2.77%. And core margin, excluding accretion and PPP, declined 11 basis points to 2.59%. Excess liquidity and
interest collected on nonaccrual loans accounted for 6 basis points of the decline.
Slide 11 shows trends in adjusted noninterest income. Adjusted noninterest income for the quarter at $51 million
was $2 million lower than Q3, largely due to seasonal declines in mortgage. Our wealth line of business finished
with a strong fourth quarter, which resulted in record revenue for the year. Our capital markets business had
another strong quarter. It finished the year just shy of last year's record revenue. Mortgage production was up
slightly in the quarter, but a seasonal decline in the size of the pipeline resulted in a $3.9 million decrease in
revenue.
Next, slide 12 shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses. Adjusting for merger charges and tax credit
amortization, noninterest expense was $123 million. The quarter-over-quarter increase was driven by additional
lending incentives related to strong commercial and mortgage production. Additionally, increases in marketing
and professional fees categories were related to investments in Minnesota marketing efforts and the
establishment of a new brand for a high net worth wealth division that we discussed last quarter.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
Turning to PPP loans on slide 13, you will see a roll forward of those balances which finished just $169 million at
quarter end. Unamortized fees on the remaining loans totaled $6.4 million. We anticipate most of the remaining
loans will be forgiven in the first half of 2022 and the related fees recognized accordingly.
Slide 14 shows our credit trends. Credit conditions continue to be benign and our commercial and consumer
portfolios continue to perform exceptionally well. Delinquencies ticked up 1 basis point to end the quarter at a very
low 11 basis points. We were pleased to post a fifth consecutive quarter in a net recovery position, resulting in full
year net recoveries of $4.8 million.
The nonperforming loans to total loan ratio once again hit a new cycle low at 92 basis points. And while this metric
remains higher than peers, the net charge-offs to NPL ratio is significantly better than peers. We believe our
approach to downgrading troubled credits early and a patient approach to workout results in better outcomes for
our clients and ultimately lower costs for the bank.
On slide 15, you will see the details of our fourth quarter allowance which stands at $107 million, a slight decline
from Q3. Credit loss expectations showed a slight improvement quarter-over-quarter, but the related reserve
release was largely offset by additional reserves for loan growth. While our outlook on credit remains optimistic,
we believe it is still prudent to maintain above average levels of qualitative reserves, which showed a $37 million
to quarter end. As a reminder, we also continue to carry $34 million in unamortized marks from our acquired
portfolios.
As I wrap up my comments, here are some key takeaways. We are very pleased with the fundamental results of
the quarter and year. Strong commercial loan growth led to stable core net interest income despite interest rate
headwinds. Our fee-based businesses led by wealth, mortgage and capital markets continue to perform well and
provide a great launching point for 2022. Expenses remained well controlled and our strong credit quality
continues to keep credit costs low.
Slide 16 includes thoughts and our outlook for 2022. We ended the quarter with a healthy $2.5 billion commercial
pipeline, which supports our favorable outlook on loan growth. This historically low interest rate environment will
continue to put pressure on net interest income, which should be mitigated through continued earning asset
growth. Rising short-term rates will have a positive impact on earnings as we have gradually repositioned the
balance sheet to a more asset-sensitive position.
The PPP loan forgiveness process continues for our clients. We expect runoff of most of the remaining balances
and related fee recognition to occur in the first half of 2022. We expect our fee businesses to continue to perform
well. We are encouraged by the momentum in our wealth business and the strong commercial activity should help
maintain the high level of performance in our capital markets business.
Mortgage revenue should follow industry trends and be seasonally lower in the first quarter. Our other fee lines
are expected to be stable in the near-term. ONB standalone expenses are expected to rise 2% to 3% in 2022 and
should follow typical seasonal pattern. The estimate includes an expectation of slightly higher merit increases
related to inflation and continued strategic investments in both revenue, talent and technology.
A brief update on taxes. We continue to expect a reduction in the volatility caused by our tax credits as we work
through the last of the remaining one-year historical tax credit commitments. In total, we are expecting
approximately $12 million in tax credit amortization for the year with a corresponding ONB standalone full-year
effective tax rate of approximately 17% to 18%. The pro forma [indiscernible] (12:25) for the combined company
would be in the range of 21% to 22%.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
In light of the delayed close of our merger with FMB, we want to provide an update on the combined company
expense expectations. Our June 1 announcement assumed 75% of the annualized cost synergies would be
realized in 2022. The first quarter close of the deal and a corresponding July conversion date is now expected to
reduce the 2022 impact to approximately 50% of the total synergies with the majority realized in the second half of
the year. That said, we are still confident we will realize 100% of the $109 million in targeted savings, which will
help us deliver meaningful positive operating leverage. In other words, the magnitude of the saves is unchanged
but the timing has now elongated by 90 days.
With that, we are happy to answer any questions that you may have, and we do have the full team here including
Jim Sandgren, Daryl Moore, and John Moran. Also joining us this morning is Mark Sander, President and COO of
First Midwest Bank.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ben Gerlinger with Hovde Group.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Ben.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Good morning, everyone. Good morning. I was curious if we could take a minute to talk kind of high level loan
growth. Through the pandemic, Old National and First Midwest did a pretty solid job growing loans pretty
consistently throughout the pandemic, especially when you compared it to like Fed H.8 data. So when you look at
the fourth quarter, Old National was a little bit lower, which makes sense. If you look over fourth quarter run rate,
you guys have done a better job. And then with the commentary about 1Q boding well for future growth, I was
curious in kind of what you guys are seeing from kind of the ground level in terms of your clients, their loan
demand. Typically, fourth quarter kind of pulls in from first quarter's demand and first quarter is usually flat. Just
kind of curious if you could just spend some time thinking out loud about how your clients are approaching their
need for loans and what it might mean for you guys in the first half of 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Ben. This is Jim Sandgren. I think you nailed it. Obviously, really strong production in the fourth quarter.
Pipeline's down a little bit seasonally, in the process of building those back up. I will tell you I think from grassroots
our clients feel really optimistic in spite of the challenges that they continue to face around labor and supply chain,
but the other thing that caused a little concern in the fourth quarter was high level of payoffs. Again, highest level
that we've seen in a number of years and don't know if that will continue in the first quarter or not. But I do think
the pipeline continues to reflect that our customers are investing and growing if they can find the labor. So again,
we think we'll get off to a good start, just not knowing exactly where that – those payoffs will continue to land.

And, Mark, would you like to add anything from your perspective?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, First Midwest Bancorp, Inc. (Illinois)
I think it's very similar to what Jim said. Pipelines are strong. Customers I think are optimistic. There is still a fair
amount of liquidity in the system, of course, and payoffs are elevated. But our production is good and solid and
should put – position us well for loan growth coming right out of the box in Q1.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Great. That's helpful. And then, Brendon, if you can kind of just look at the yield curve expectations going forward,
I know that you have two balance sheets coming together, you have [indiscernible] (16:10) so if you – if the
market's kind of expecting to have three to four hikes in 2022 and beyond a couple more, I was curious if you had
any idea of where the margin might shake out as we end 2022 with the two – like kind of combining everything
together?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Sure. Yeah, Ben, I think you're right. I think short of rate changes, I think we're getting close to the floor. I don't
think we're all the way there yet. I think there could be – continue to be some margin compression without some
help from the Fed. We have looked at both balance sheets and the margin impact from rate increases and how
we'd like to model that up, Ben, is against the floor curve. And so we think the ONB standalone is going to get
some upward movement to about 2% to 3% in NII on a standalone basis, and when we fold in FMB, which has a
slightly more asset-sensitive balance sheet, has a little more cash on hand, we think that's closer to 3% to 4%.
Again, I get the forward rate, which is now kind of 3.5% to 4% for rate hikes embedded in there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. Great. That's helpful. I will – I'll step back [indiscernible] (17:20)

Good morning, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Brendon, wanted to follow on some of those rate sensitivity
comments. Can you maybe talk a little bit about where you're most sensitive on the curve, or I guess, ideally,
where on a pro forma basis you'll be more – most sensitive? Do you benefit most at the beginning of tightening
cycle or will it take a few hikes for you to feel the full benefit?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
No, I think we benefit right out of the gate with short-term hikes. Yeah, it shouldn't be a significant difference from
quarter-to-quarter. Ultimately, long-term impact of this will be what happens – where does the middle and long
end of the curve shake out from a long-term perspective, but in this first few quarters, we'll benefit right out of the
gate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. And maybe, how do your thoughts on deposit betas fit into the equation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. So what we modeled was, I think, a fairly conservative view of deposit betas that are a little below for the
long-term full-cycle rate cycle but in that 10% to 20% which, frankly, could be very conservative assumption given
how we reacted for the first three rate hikes last cycle. I think we'll be able to manage deposit betas very well for
the first year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then just as it relates to the closure of that transaction, how quickly would you
guys be able to close after you do receive Fed approval? I imagine you're pretty much good to go just sort of
waiting on the – that green light, but what kind of a timeframe would we be looking at?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Well, we need at least 15 days from whenever we receive approval. And more than likely, we would do it at the
beginning or – end of a month or beginning of the next month just to keep the accounting clean and smooth. So
just depends on when we might hear and how close we are to the next kind of beginning of a month, Scott. But,
again, other than that, hope we're ready to close.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

there anything that I'm missing out there that maybe I just haven't picked up on and is there anything you can
share with us that gives you confidence that the transaction can close here in the first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Well, all that I can say is we continue to have very constructive dialogue. And I think it's just a matter of timing.
And as you can imagine there's a lot of priorities right now at the Fed. We had two Fed governors just as recently
as last week going through their confirmation hearings. [indiscernible] (20:19) a lot on their plate, right? They got
lot of changes. So we are patiently waiting. And those three prior announcements were ones that were in the
queue longer than us, right? So I have nothing – no reason to believe that we won't hear positive news. And so
we're just – we expect that we'll hear that news here soon and we'll move towards close, like I said, but nothing –
there's no outstanding questions or issues that we're aware of and feel like we're in good shape and ready for
approval.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. And it seems like every week, a large bank announced a – announces a new deposit product to reduce
overdraft fees. Could you maybe just talk about the Old National kind of overdraft structure and product? How
does that compare to First Midwest and whether you think you need to make any changes going forward when
the two companies combine?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
I would just say we are aligning our process and process together as we come together during the conversion in
July. We've been spending a lot of time on that. That probably means slightly lower income for the Old National
deposit service charge program. And we are looking at, like everybody else, what's going on in the industry. We're
not going to be immune from those changes in the future. I think it's a little early to know exactly how it's going to
shake out for banks our size. But, clearly, the national banks are moving towards a program. So we're going to
continue to watch it. We're going to continue to do the right things. And I would say our programs are kind of right
in the middle with everybody else, as we align the two programs. And we'll just have to wait and see ultimately if
there's a standard that gets set and how that might impact us in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. And maybe if I could squeeze in one more, you mentioned recruiting in Chicago. Is that because you see
the pro forma company just having the ability to have a larger kind of platform and the need for more lenders, or
do you expect some attrition and you want to fill some holes, so to speak, in the company?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
We've really seen almost no or minimal attrition so far, and don't expect to have any. I mean, our teams from day
one saw the opportunity, right? And we're excited about what that might mean for them. I just think there's an
opportunity to continue to invest. We have a great story to tell. When we get a chance to tell the story to potential
team members, they like it. They feel the energy. They feel the opportunity that's in front of them. And so it's being
more opportunistic around that. And I just believe there's always an opportunity to add talent. And so we're just
going to continue to go out and do that, but nothing that we're worried about in terms of our existing team. We got
great team members in Chicago today who are completely capable of doing the work, but I do think there's more

opportunity and we will have a bigger balance sheet. I think there'll be more middle market opportunities for us,
just we combine the two companies. And we'll continue to take advantage of that client set and make sure we got
team members who can fill those needs.

James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Morning, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, Jim. Question on just the balance sheet position in the close in pro forma. Brendon, maybe a
question for you, any tweaks that you might be doing on either side of the balance sheet to kind of put your best
foot forward pro forma?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Chris. Yeah. We're taking a look at that. I guess what we can tell you now is anything that we do will not be
material to the overall balance sheet and certainly anything we do, we'll be looking to do in an EPS and capital
neutral way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then once you close, obviously, you're in a very strong capital position, what are the philosophical
thoughts on a buyback at these levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Well, obviously, don't want to do anything ahead of any kind of Federal Reserve approval. So I think once –
hopefully, we receive approval very soon. I think we can look back at our capital and just make any actions going
forward. We're obviously going to be at a low point once we close and mark the balance sheet, and so we'll be
looking at that and we'll be looking at it, quite frankly, as what's the best return of capital, right? And so we'll just
continue to do what we've always done. We've probably run a little more capital on average than some of our
peers, especially given our credit quality. But we'll make sure we do the appropriate things for shareholders and
manage capital and take a look at that. But as Brendon said, it's still little too early. We're looking at the balance
sheet and any potential actions we might take. But if we do anything, it's going to be pretty minimal.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. But post-closing, the message on a buyback is it's on the table, but it's balanced against the growth. Is that
the right interpretation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Absolutely. Absolutely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe one more on deposits. I think we as analysts continue to be surprised by the pace and the
stickiness of the deposits. What are you seeing like incrementally on deposit growth? What are your expectations
for maybe the next six to nine months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Chris. So, I think we were a little surprised to see acceleration of the growth again here in the fourth
quarter. It had slowed a bit in the third and picked back up pace. And as we study this and look at past cycles, our
view is that this sticks around for longer and that growth may moderate a bit, but we don't see that at least in the
near term this is going to run out of the bank very quickly. That said, we are prepared. We have a tremendous
amount of asset liquidity. If this does get ahead of us, I think we have a really strong balance sheet and great
liquidity position to manage through that, too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Thanks. Thanks, Brendon.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Maybe obvious here but on slide 16, your NII guide, I'm assuming that assumes
no rate increases. Is that right, Brendon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
That's correct. That's exactly how we're [indiscernible] (26:41)

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
Okay. Yeah...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Good. And then in terms of your expense guide, the 2% to 3%, how much of that is hiring
versus just call it natural pressures on expenses like comp and technology?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, those are the two biggest factors, right? And clearly our merit process is more outsized than it has
been in the past. We anticipated this and we tried to get ahead of this a couple years back, but we're also
accelerating some of those increases particularly at the lowest wage side. And then, obviously, our hiring – I think
we'll be pretty consistent with what we did last year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
So that's kind of built in the run rate at some level, but – and on average, they are more expensive. The people
we're hiring today are more expensive than maybe kind of our average team member today. So I think like any
other bank that I've seen so far, we're not going to be immune from that. Historically, would have thought our
expense growth would have been flattish year-over-year and today we're saying it's up 2% or 3% depending on
kind of those needs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then if you set aside the synergies from the merger, safe to assume that we should expect similar type
growth at First Midwest on their core?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Similar, yes.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
Yeah. Okay. And then one more thing on lending. It's obviously picked up a little bit for the industry in terms of
commercial. You guys have certainly bucked that trend and had better growth. But do you expect the pipeline
numbers to continue to increase? Is there anything different in terms of the loan growth story that's emerging right
now or is it just really more of the same?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Jon, I would think that pipelines would continue to rebuild and grow like they did last year. We haven't seen
anything to the contrary, but certainly stay very close to our customers. But again, optimism for our customer base
continues to be good in spite of the challenges that are facing them with supply chain and labor.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
And I would also add some of our new talent coming online, Jon, and their ability to run out their non-competes
and things like that, I think, gives us more confidence. The team we're just putting in place right now in Kansas
City, again, those will all be kind of net additive to the pipeline as we continue to hire new talent and get them in a
ready place to be successful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Okay. And any theme on the new talent you're hiring and is it just big bank fatigue wanting to come
to a company like yours, but any thematic story behind that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, I think it's a lot of it. I think it's – sometimes it's hard to do your job, to serve your clients, serve your
communities at some of the largest institutions. And I think they see a growth story here, an entrepreneur – little
bit entrepreneurial story here. And all that is pretty exciting to be a part of, right? And for better or worse, some of
those largest competitors we face in our markets have lost that ability to do that and so – but we feel really good
about the story, and clearly, it's working. It's an interesting time. Right now, we're just kind of working through
year-end stuff, but I'm confident we'll continue to hire new talent as we enter the New Year here and continue to
have lots of opportunities in front of us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: At this time, there are no additional questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan
