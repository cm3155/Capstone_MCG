Q2 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2023
For the next few minutes, I'll discuss HTLF's highlights for the quarter, then turn the call over to Bryan McKeag,
Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our performance and our financials. Also joining us today is Nathan
Jones, Chief Credit Officer, who can answer questions regarding the stable credit quality across our portfolios.
The HTLF Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share on the company's common
stock, payable on August 25, 2023. The board also approved a dividend of $175 for Series E preferred stock,
which results in a dividend of $43.75 per depositary share payable on October 16, 2023.
For more than 40 years, HTLF has increased or maintained our common stock dividend each quarter. This
reflects our strength and stability and confidence in our strategies and performance. In the second quarter, HTLF
strength and diverse geography enabled us to continue executing our strategies despite recent industry
challenges. We delivered strong loan growth and new customer relationships and our stable deposit base and
growth strategies give us momentum heading into the second half of the year.
For the quarter, net income available to common stockholders was $47.4 million and EPS of $1.11. These
numbers were negatively impacted by two items; a charge-off of $5.3 million related to a previously disclosed
overdraft, the result of a fraud incident impacting the account of a single long-time customer, and $1.5 million of
premium write-offs related to an unusually high level of purchased SBA loan payoffs that were processed during
the quarter. These were partially offset by the $4.3 million gain from the sale and transfer of the recordkeeping
and administration services component of our retirement business to July Business Services. We view these as
notable items this quarter. Together, they decreased pre-tax income by $2.5 million and EPS by $0.05.
Our growth strategies are delivering results. In the second quarter, HTLF added new customers, delivered solid
loan growth, and significantly increased fee income. From the linked quarter, we added 1,300 net new commercial
accounts and more than 1,400 net new consumer accounts. Commercial and ag loans grew $224 million or 2%,
and loan yields increased 44 basis points on newly originated loans.
Service charges and fees increased $2.5 million or 15%, including an annual VISA incentive of $1.6 million. And
capital markets fees increased $1.6 million or 65%. Customer deposits were flat and expenses were slightly
elevated, including a $1.1 million increase in advertising spending. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet
and increased borrowing capacity by more than $500 million to a total of $3.3 billion, with less than $1 million
outstanding. Our capital ratios, including all unrealized gains and losses as of June 30, exceeded all well-
capitalized regulatory ratios. Bryan will go into more details.
Let's start with deposits. HTLF Banks have a diverse and granular deposit base. As a result of our strategic
diversification, our customer deposits are diversified by both geography and industry, with no industry
concentration higher than 10% across our portfolios.
Overall, total deposits for the quarter were flat from the linked quarter at $17.7 billion, and 66% of total balances
are insured or collateralized. Total customer deposits were also flat from the linked quarter. While we maintain a
favorable deposit mix, customer demand accounts decreased from 35% to 34%, which reflects the ongoing
transition to interest-bearing accounts.
We've launched a commercial deposit campaign with enhanced customer outreach and product offerings in small
business and commercial. The campaign drove new commercial deposit balances in the second quarter, and
positive trends have continued in July. With increased marketing spend, resulting in additional customer contact
and accounts opened, we've also continued our consumer deposit campaign that launched late in the first quarter.

Turning to loans. In the second quarter, we saw continued strength across our commercial loan portfolios. From
the linked quarter, commercial and industrial increased $92 million or 3%. Owner occupied real estate increased
$86 million or 4%. Non-owner occupied real estate increased $109 million or 5%. Construction decreased $89
million or 8%. And our ag portfolio increased $30 million or 4%.
In total, commercial and ag loans grew $224 million, an increase of 2% from the linked quarter and in line with our
guidance. 58% of loan production was commercial and industrial and owner occupied real estate. We delivered
loan production across all of our regions with particular strength in the West, Mountain West, and Southwest.
In the second quarter, we added more than 300 new commercial relationships, representing $214 million in
funded loans and $48 million of new deposits. On average, new originations were of higher credit quality than the
overall portfolio, as measured by risk ratings and credit scores, and 81% of these loans have variable rate
structures, an increase from 75% in the first quarter. Our commercial pipeline remains strong at over $1 billion,
with 60% in commercial and industrial and owner occupied real estate. Loans are distributed across all regions.
Our consumer loan portfolio increased $11 million or 2% from the linked quarter, while residential mortgage
decreased $13 million or 2%. We expect total loan growth of $150 million to $200 million in the third quarter,
which we expect to substantially fund through customer deposit growth.
Turning to key credit metrics. Our disciplined credit approach is delivering stable credit quality across our
portfolios. Delinquency ratio remains low at 12 basis points. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total
assets remains flat at 33 basis points. Non-pass rated loans increased slightly from the linked quarter to 4.8%.
And excluding the previously disclosed $5.3 million overdraft, remaining net charge-offs were $4 million, most of
which had been previously reserved in the prior quarters.
Market conditions have been applying additional pressure on the commercial real estate office market across the
country. We feel good that our office exposure is 3.5% of our total portfolio. We continue to place emphasis on
targeted reviews of our portfolios and recently conducted in-depth reviews of each office credit over $1 million.
We believe our portfolio is well constructed, granular and generally situated outside of central business districts.
We continue to enhance our ongoing portfolio management and surveillance and refine how we screen new
opportunities for underwriting. For more on our CRE office exposure, please see page 21 in the investor deck.
HTLF is executing our strategies and delivering new customers, new deposit relationships, strong loan growth,
increased fee income, stable credit quality, and we're driving long-term efficiency. Bank charter consolidation
continues on budget and on schedule. We started at the beginning of 2021 and we expect to finish early in the
fourth quarter.
We've successfully consolidated 9 of our 11 banks today, demonstrating we can consolidate charters to drive
greater internal efficiency while delivering external growth. We also enhanced the products and services offered
by our Retirement Plan Services business through our partnership with July Business Services. HTLF sold the
recordkeeping and administration services business to July and retained investment management oversight and
participant education and support business. The transaction was completed and recordkeeping services were
transitioned in the second quarter. Both firms are stronger together as July's technology enhances the customer
experience.
Our strategies and accomplishments continue to be recognized locally and nationally. Nielsen report ranked HTLF
among the top US commercial credit card issuers for the eighth year in a row. We continue to demonstrate

consistent strength in the commercial payments space, as HTLF saw a 30% increase in purchase volume growth
in 2022.
Last year, HTLF surpassed $1 billion in annual purchase volume as a commercial credit card issuer. And we
continue to be one of the fastest growing VISA commercial card issuers. HTLF earns this recognition each year
through our employees' dedication and commitment to serving our customers, communities, shareholders and
each other. We consistently deliver strength, insight and growth during good and challenging times. Together, we
are HTLF.
I'll now turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our performance and
financials.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thanks, Bruce, and good afternoon. As Bruce described, we continued to move forward in a challenging
environment this quarter, reporting earnings per share of $1.11, loan growth of over $220 million, and a stable,
albeit, more costly deposit base. In addition to the two – to the items Bruce mentioned in his comments, I would
mention two other items this quarter, the charter consolidation restructuring cost of $1.9 million and the $300,000
of loss on sale of securities.
Before I go into more detail, I want to remind everyone that our second quarter earnings release and investor
presentation are both available in the IR section of HTLF's website.
I'll start my comments with the provision for credit losses, which totaled $5.4 million, or $2.3 million higher than
last quarter. This quarter, the provision, consistent with last quarter, incorporates an economic outlook that
anticipates a moderate recession developing over the next 12 months.
Net charge-offs increased this quarter to $9.3 million, $5.3 million of which is related to the previously mentioned
customer overdraft and directly impacted the provision. Most of the remaining $4 million had previously been
reserved for in prior quarters and, as such, did not impact the provision.
At the end of the quarter, total allowance for lending-related credit losses, which includes both the allowance for
credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments decreased $4 million to $129.8 million, or 1.1% of total loans
compared to 1.16% last quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet. Bruce already discussed loans and deposits, so I'll start with investments.
Investments declined almost $300 million to $6.7 billion, representing 33% of assets, with a total – with a tax
equivalent yield of 3.87% and will generate cash flows of nearly $1.3 billion over the next 12 months with
approximately $250 million next quarter. The unrealized loss on the AFS portfolio worsened by $43 million this
quarter to $618 million.
Our relatively small HTM portfolio of $835 million or 12% of investments has an unrecorded negative fair value
mark of $28 million. We utilized nearly $250 million of cash flow this quarter from the investment portfolio to fund
loan growth and pay down borrowings.
Moving on to borrowings. Total borrowings declined $48 million to $417 million, or 2.1% of total loans – total
assets, sorry. The reduction was primarily in customer repos, and we had less than $1 million of Fed advances

outstanding at quarter end. To summarize our liquidity profile at quarter end, we have $1.3 billion of cash flow
coming off our securities portfolio over the next 12 months, with $250 million next quarter.
We have a low level of outstanding borrowings and $3.3 billion of available capacity at the Fed and FHLB. We
have several Fed fund borrowing lines and brokered deposit sources that remain open and available. Our
customer deposit base is granular and well-diversified with over 66% of balances either secured or collateralized.
Our loan-to-deposit ratio is 66%, and when removing wholesale deposits, it remains low at 80%.
We have cash and unpledged available securities totaled – totaling over $4.1 billion. And lastly, the holding
company cash position stands at $268 million, or 3.5 times our current annualized interest and dividend
payments. In addition, our dividend payout rate is relatively low at 27% of current EPS.
With regards to capital, regulatory capital ratios remain strong with common equity Tier 1 at just over 11.3% and
total risk-based capital of nearly 15%. Adjusted for unrealized losses on our investments, the ratios remain above
well-capitalized level at approximately 4 point – 7.4% and 11%. The tangible common equity ratio increased 14
basis points to 5.86% at quarter end. The decline in market values of investments was partially offset by an
increase in fair value swaps this quarter, resulting in a net decrease of 6 basis points from accumulated other
comprehensive income or AOCI.
Moving to the income statement, starting with revenue, net interest income totaled $147.1 million this quarter,
which was $5.1 million lower than the prior quarter. And the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis fell 16
basis points this quarter to 3.24%. The main drivers of the decrease were $1.5 million of premium write-offs
related to a higher level of purchased SBA loan payoffs that were received and processed during the quarter,
which reduced NIM, net interest margin by 3 basis points.
And a continued shift in deposit balances from lower costing non-maturity deposits to much higher cost in time
deposits reduced net interest income by nearly $2.5 million and decreased net interest margin by 5 basis points.
Non-interest income of $32.5 million this quarter was up $2.5 million from the prior quarter. Excluding security
losses, core non-interest income was up $1.9 million to $3.8 million, which exceeded our expectation of $30
million to $31 million. Strong capital markets fees were primarily the driver again this quarter.
Shifting to expenses, non-interest expenses totaled $109.5 million this quarter, that's down $1.6 million from last
quarter. Excluding restructuring, tax credit costs and asset gains and losses, the run rate of recurring operating
expenses increased $3.1 million to $110.8 million, coming in higher than our forecasted $108 million to $109
million. The increase was driven by $1.1 million higher deposit-related advertising costs and a $2.4 million
increase in professional fees due to several items, most notably higher legal costs for credit issues and an
increased consulting activity level compared to last quarter.
Looking ahead to the rest of 2023, HTLF expects to see loan growth of $150 million to $200 million, or 2% per
quarter, and customer deposit growth of $100 million to $150 million, or 1% per quarter. Achieving these loan and
deposit growth expectations would enable the bulk of investment cash flows to be available to decrease
wholesale deposits. The net interest margin is expected to stabilize near our June run rate in the low to mid-320s
on a tax equivalent basis.
Provisions for credit losses are projected to range from $3 million to $5 million per quarter. Obviously, any
declines in market conditions and projections could impact future provisions if a worse than moderate recession
develops or credit quality metrics decline significantly.

Core net interest – non-interest income, that is excluding investment gains and losses, is expected to be $31
million to $32 million per quarter. Recurring operating expenses are expected to be in the $109 million to $110
million range per quarter. Our charter consolidation, restructuring costs are forecasted to be between $2.5 million
and $3 million per quarter over the next – for the next two quarters. And finally, we believe a tax rate in the 23% to
24% range, excluding new tax credits, is a reasonable run rate.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce.

Just a question on, I guess, the slide – your beta slide. It looks like the total deposit beta at just under 35%. Any
thoughts on where that terminal or peak level would be and kind of timing of that as you guys forecast?

Bryan R. McKeag A

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
So, I think we're doing pretty well there. If you look at what happened this last quarter, it was pretty high at over
105%. So, we, in this last cycle or two, have had to really follow the rate increases, at least, on a percentage
basis given the competition. Our belief is and our hope is that now this next raise, and if there is another one, that
we can get back to more normally a 30-or-so-percent deposit beta for the next raise or two and which would keep
us probably in that 25% to 30% range in total cycle for our customer deposits. And that's about normal for us in a
total cycle move. So I think that's reasonable, but really depends on competition.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. So, you think you'd kind of bounce along the top side of that and maybe rein it in, in coming quarters. Is that
– did I capture that right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So slowing down to maybe that 30% beta here in the next move or two [ph] on that – (26:40) whatever that
calculates out to, but that should keep us within our normal beta move for customer deposits, I think.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Got it. Thanks, Bryan. And then just to jump in gears to the charter consolidation, I get a sense for – I think
you've talked about $20 million annually. What amount of saves have been achieved to-date and maybe I'll just
leave it there – just what percent have you got to so far?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Bryan, do you want to take that one?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. I think I would – it's hard. Expenses tend to be a little bit – [ph] to use the term right, goo, (27:22)
there's a lot of things that go in and out that it's hard to isolate what's just related to consolidation as we move
forward. Our goal, and I think if we can get the leverage, that if you look at our slide 14, we were down – I think, in
the fourth quarter, we were down close to 2.12% or 2.10% on our core cost per asset. That's what we're shooting
for. So, we've got about half to three-quarters of it, I think, today. And I think it's going to come at the end when
we can finally get to one bank and we're doing things one way across everything. So, little ways to go, but a lot of
that is in.

Okay. And that aligns with maybe end of year, I mean, you talked about the expectations or Bryan did about
expenses for the next couple of quarters. Is that kind of the charter cost kind of that stops and fully achieved by
year-end? Is that, generally speaking, the expectation?

Bruce K. Lee A

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Bryan, you talked about the assumptions on the NIM going forward maybe in low to mid-320% range. What type
of assumptions do you have baked in there? Is that assuming the Fed futures are accurate and we may be done
with the rate hikes and then from the non-interest bearing deposits coming down at 28%. What are you thinking –
where are you thinking that goes in that 320% – low to mid-320% outlook?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2023
Yeah. I think it's a fairly flat assumption on the non-maturity deposits and we might need this – we might need to
keep this last move at that 30% beta so we can get just a little bit of NIM help. It'll be – it won't be a lot, only 1
basis point or 2 basis points. But that 1 basis point or 2 basis points in this environment is a lot. So, we need both
this last move to kind of come through a little stronger on the earning – the income side than the expense side
and then we need to hold our non-interest bearing deposits relatively flat.
We did a decent job last quarter. If you look at customer deposits, they only went down 1 percentage point of the
mix. So, hopefully, we can hold somewhere in that range.
Bruce, I don't know if you have any other comments around – thoughts around that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So, David, when we think about kind of our modeling, it's being able to fund the loan growth with deposit
growth as we've mentioned. We think $150 million to $200 million of loan growth. We think we can grow deposits
plus or minus $150 million. And then the other thing that happens with that is, as Bryan referenced, when you
include the wholesale funding, it's 28%. But if you take the wholesale funding out, it's 34%, is demand. And if
we're able to take all of our cash flow off the investment portfolio and pay down the wholesale funding by $250
million, that shift helps us as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Makes sense. Thank you. And then, separately, more of a bigger picture strategy question, but there's a lot
of disruption in the industry now after the events from March. Within HTLF, how much time would you say is spent
focusing on offense versus defense? And then, how does that compare to maybe how much time you're spending
on offense versus defense a year ago?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Great question, David. I'd say, right now, we're probably 60% on offense and I'd say, a year ago, we were
probably 80%. So, we're still spending a lot of time on offense. And part of that is just outreach to our existing
customers and to prospects. We're spending almost all of our time doing that. And when you think about
offensive, I would also include recruiting. We're very active in the market recruiting talent as well.

Just wanted to follow up on the margin here. Some of this margin stability also benefit from the earning asset mix
if you're reducing securities book by another $250 million, and that helps reduce some of funding side, so just
maybe a better earning estimate. Is that also helping the margin there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. That's...

Go ahead, Andrew.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I was going to say that it seems like if you're going to take out another $250 million for the next few quarters, that
trend should have – should remain consistent for the, at least, in the next year. And then, if you have that plus an
eventual stop in the Fed raising rates, I mean, where do you think the margin ultimately bottoms out when you
think it can start rising again?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2023
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
That's a good question. Again, if we can pull off what we think, we're going to be trading out deposits at – on an
average should be, probably, today in, what, the mid-3s. If it's all CDs, it will be a little bit higher. But if we can get
a blend and hold our deposits, and that will fund loans that are now in the upper-7s to 8%. And then if we can take
the investments and use that to pay down, you're taking probably 4% and paying down 5% costing deposits. So,
all of that is positive to the NIM. So, but to me, it's all about the deposit side. Can we hold the deposits and can we
hold the betas that we need to? So that whole kind of moving parts can happen.
If that doesn't happen, you will see the margin probably continue to slide a bit. How low could it go if that
happens? I would say, without doing a lot of math, I think, it could be a little bit 5 basis points, 10 basis points
more. But that's a lot of moving parts.
So, Bruce, I don't know if there's anything, obviously, comes in mind on this question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think – yeah. Andrew, for us, it's all about doing what we did this quarter in opening up all those net new
accounts, over 3,400 on a combined basis and continue to grow the new relationships and being able to fund the
loans with deposits. We're able to do that. We're able to actually grow our margin. And that...

Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. All right. That's helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I mean, that's the entire strategy that we have. That's why we're playing so much offense. That's why we were
spending the advertising dollars. And we're definitely seeing the account growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Just on the fee income side, does the increase in the service charges, the new customer accounts
contribute to the uptick there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I would say probably not a lot yet, but they will...

We had a one-time VISA...

Bruce K. Lee A

business, Andrew.

Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with
Stephens. Your line is open.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good evening, guys. How are you doing?

Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Terry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Bryan, thanks for all the forward-looking commentary. Maybe my first question, I looked at the annual meeting
presentation, and you talked about recruiting and hiring in markets. I guess, the question is, how has the market
disruption from March assisted you or maybe worked against you on the hiring front? And then last week, when I
think about that bank merger that was announced, there's a lot of overlap with your markets. And could that
presents an opportunity for you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So, Terry, I'll take that one. So, the comments both in at the annual meeting as well as what's been going
on since the annual meeting, Denver is clearly one of the markets we've been very successful in, in recruiting,
also in Arizona and a couple of others. So we're on that path and we clearly think that the disruption on the

acquisition will help push some of the people over the edge. There was a lot of loyalty to the one bank where we
have a lot of overlap. And I think now, just in the last week, we've seen some activity there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then, a question for Nathan. What are you monitoring and looking at within the C&I portfolio? Any areas
you're deemphasizing and there's some red flags and yellow flags?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan R. Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. We feel pretty good about our C&I portfolio especially. It really continues to perform. We've had a couple of
one-offs we continue to launch. But really if we're just looking at the industry there, I'd say probably focusing on
the ones that might be most susceptible to potential downturn. So contractors, construction-based firms and other
type service providers are probably getting the most focus now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my questions.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Damon DelMonte with KBW. Your
line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good afternoon, guys. I hope everything is doing well today. So just to kind of follow up on the credit topic.
Just wondering what your maturity schedule looks like for commercial real estate loans over the next few
quarters? Do you have a lot coming up for renewal?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
No, not really. It's one of the real positives for us. We really do have a very elongated maturity schedule. I think
we even have that highlight in our Investor Day, which you can see there. But I'd say about 50% of our portfolio
from the CRE, general CRE portfolio is going to mature over the next year and a half. So very little. The vast
majority of it is in out-years, much further out, around the [ph] 4% to 5% (40:06) range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, Bryan, with regards to the expense guide, should we anticipate
the advertising expense staying elevated like we saw this quarter or does that kind of come back in during the
next couple of quarters?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2023
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Probably going to stay about where it was, maybe a little bit lower, but I'd say about where it is.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Damon, this is Bruce. I would say probably for the third quarter, it will remain where it is. We'll probably
begin to reduce it a little bit in the fourth quarter. At least, that's been our history.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then should we also think about the outside services line item coming down as well because of
some kind of one-time things that occurred this last quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. That's where we need to focus. That's one of the discretionary items that we need to get. And there's lots of
pieces in there. So, it takes a lot of different areas. But that's where I think we need to focus.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
