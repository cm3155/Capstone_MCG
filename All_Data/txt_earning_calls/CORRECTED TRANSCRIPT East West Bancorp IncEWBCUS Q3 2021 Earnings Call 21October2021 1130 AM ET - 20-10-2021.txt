Thank you, Julianna. Good morning. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our earnings call. I will begin the
review of our financial results with slide 3 of our presentation. This morning, we reported third quarter 2021 net
income of $225 million, or $1.57 per share. Strong organic balance sheet growth drove a 21% annualized
increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter to $469 million. The increase in revenue solidified with expense
discipline, drove pre-tax, pre-provision income growth of 26% annualized for the third quarter to $302 million. Our
pre-tax, pre-provision profitability ratio continues to be industry leading and was 2% for the third quarter of 2021.
We recorded a negative $10 million provision for credit losses this quarter. Asset quality continued to improve,
nonperforming assets decreased quarter-over-quarter and net charge-offs remained low. At the same time, we
maintained a healthy allowance for loan losses at 1.38% of loans as of September 30, 2021.
In sum, we returned an attractive 1.5% on average assets, 15.7% on average equity and 17.2% on average
tangible equity for the third quarter of 2021.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Slide 4 presents a summary of our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2021, our total assets crossed $60 billion
and total loans reached a record of $40.5 billion. Excluding Paycheck Protection Program loans, total loans grew
[indiscernible] (04:03) or 11% annualized from June 30, 2021.
Third quarter production and loan growth were well-diversified across all our key loan portfolios of C&I, residential
mortgage and commercial real estate. Year-to-date for the first nine months of 2021, loans grew 10% annualized,
excluding PPP. For the full year of 2021, we are increasing our loan growth outlook to a range of 10% to 11%, up
from our prior range of 9% to 10%.
Throughout 2021, loan growth has been broad-based across all our portfolios and teams, and at this point, we
expect this will continue for 2022. Overall, we anticipate that C&I loan growth will be the strongest based on
continued good execution from our front-line and a rebounding economic backdrop.
In the third quarter, deposit growth continued to be very strong. As of September 30, 2021 total deposits reached
a record of $53.4 billion, up $774 million or 6% annualized from June 30. Noninterest-bearing deposit grew $1.4
billion or 25% annualized to a record $23.2 billion as of September 30, making up 43% of total deposit at quarter
end and up from 36% a year ago.
Turning to slide 5, you can see our strong capital ratios. As of September 30, 2021 we had a common equity Tier
1 ratio of 12.8%, total capital ratio of 14.2% which provide us with meaningful capacity for future growth. Book
value per share and tangible equity per share were both up 3% quarter-over-quarter. East West board of directors
had declared fourth quarter 2021 dividends for the company's common stock. The common stock cash dividend
of $0.33 is payable on November 15, 2021 to stockholders of record on November 1, 2021.
Moving on to a discussion of our loan portfolio, beginning with slide 6. C&I loans outstanding, excluding PPP,
were $13 billion as of September 30, 2021, an increase of 21% annualized from June 30. Total C&I commitments
were $18.9 billion as of September 30, a sequential increase of 26% annualized. We achieved a strong rate of
C&I growth despite a slight lower utilization rate, which was 69% as of September 30, compared with 70% as of
June 30. On an average basis, C&I loans, excluding PPP, grew by 16% annualized in the third quarter. We
expect to continue to see strong growth in C&I loan balances and commitments in the fourth quarter.
Third quarter loan growth was spread across our lending teams and geographies. By industries, we saw strong
net growth this quarter from technology, private equity, consumer goods, general manufacturing and wholesale,
and entertainment. It was indeed a well-diversified quarter in terms of growth.
I would also highlight that the private equity growth this quarter well-exemplified our cross-border business.
Growth came from clients domiciled in the United States, Hong Kong and in Mainland China. Accounting for 4%
of our total loan portfolio were $1.7 billion of loan domiciled in our China subsidiary bank and our Hong Kong
branch. 98% of this portfolio consists of C&I loans, well-diversified by industry. These loans are up from $1.6
billion as of June 30.
Slide 7 and 8 shows the details of our commercial real estate portfolio, which is well-diversified by geography and
property type and consists of low loan-to-value loans. Total commercial real estate loans was $15.5 billion as of
September 30, 2021, up by 4% annualized from June 30. This quarter, we saw strongest growth by property type
in industrial CRE and multi-family mortgage.

In slide 9, we provide details regarding our residential mortgage portfolio, which consists of single-family
mortgages and home equity line of credit. Residential mortgage loans were $11 billion as of September 30, 2021,
growing by 9% annualized from June 30. During the third quarter, we originated $982 million of residential
mortgage loans, which was down from a record-setting second quarter, but up by 28% from origination in the year
ago third quarter.
I will now turn the call over to Irene for a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement.
Irene?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thanks, Dominic. I'll start with our asset quality metrics on slide 10. Overall, our key asset quality metrics continue
to improve quarter-over-quarter. Total criticized loans were down sequentially by 2% to $1 billion, or 2.5% of total
loans as of September 30, 2021. Year-to-date, criticized loans decreased by 17% and the criticized loan ratio
improved by 67 basis points from 3.2% of loans as of December 31, 2020. Quarter-over-quarter, non-performing
assets were down by 24% to $173 million or 28 basis points of total assets as of September 30. Year-to-date,
non-performing assets decreased by 26% and the non-performing asset ratio improved by 17 basis points from
45 basis points of assets.
The third quarter improvement in non-performing assets was largely driven by commercial real estate and oil and
gas resolutions. Our oil and gas loan portfolio has continued to decrease and commitments are now below $1
billion. As discussed previously, our goal was to reduce commitments to this level. This is about the right size for
us.
On slide 11, we present the components of our allowance for loan losses. Our allowance totaled $560 million as
of September 30, 2021, 1.41% of loans excluding PPP, compared with $586 million or 1.52% as of June 30. The
quarter-over-quarter reduction in the allowance largely reflects an improved macroeconomic forecast. Net charge-
offs were essentially unchanged at $13.5 million in the third quarter, compared with $13.3 million in the second
quarter. The net charge-off ratio was 13 basis points of average loans annualized for both the third and second
quarters. During the third quarter, we recorded a negative $10 million provision for the credit losses, compared
with a negative $15 million provision in the second quarter. Currently, we expect to record a negative provision of
approximately $10 million for the fourth quarter, similar to this quarter.
And now, moving on to a discussion of our income statement on slide 12. This slide summarizes the key line
items of the income statement, which I'll discuss in more detail on the following slides. [ph] In non-interest income
included in interest rate contrast (00:12:19) and other derivatives are mark-to-market adjustments, which were a
positive $2.5 million in the third quarter, compared with a $5 million loss in the second quarter. These primarily
relate to changes in the credit valuation adjustment. On this slide, the CBA marks are included under the other
line of non-interest income. Amortization of tax credits and other investments increased this quarter to $38 million,
compared with $27 million in the second quarter, reflecting the impact of investments that closed during the third
quarter. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate that the amortization of tax credits and other investments will be
approximately $30 million.
The third quarter income tax expense was $48 million and the effective tax rate was 17.5%. The year-to-date
effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2021 was 16% and we expect that the 2021 full year effective tax rate
will be approximately 17%.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
I'll now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slides 13 through 16, starting
with the average balance sheet. Third quarter average loans of $40 billion grew by $338 million or 3% linked
quarter annualized and by $1.1 billion or 12% annualized, excluding PPP. $645 million of our PPP loans were
forgiven by the SBA during the third quarter.
Third quarter average deposits of $53.5 billion were up by $3.3 billion or 26% linked quarter annualized, led by
growth in non-interest-bearing demand deposits, which increased by $3.5 billion. With a strong deposit growth,
our average loan-to-deposit ratio was 75% in the third quarter, down from 79% in the second quarter. Average
earning assets growth in the third quarter reflected the strong deposit growth. On an average basis, interest-
bearing cash and deposits with banks grew $2 billion, securities increased by $786 million and repurchase
agreements increased by $253 million.
Turning to slide 14, third quarter 2021 net interest income of $396 million was the highest quarterly net interest
income in the history of East West, growing by 20% linked quarter annualized. Income related to PPP loans was
$15 million in the third quarter, consisting of $12 million of deferred fees and $3 million of interest income. As of
September 30, we have $13.5 million of PPP deferred loan fees remaining to accrete.
Quarter-over-quarter, the GAAP net interest margin contracted to 2.70% in the third quarter, a decrease of 5 basis
points from the prior quarter. Excluding PPP, the third quarter adjusted net interest margin of 2.64% contracted by
9 basis points sequentially. As you can see from the waterfall chart on this slide, the variability of our net interest
margin comes from excess liquidity. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in the net interest margin for the third
quarter was largely driven by the increase in average cash and interest-bearing deposits with banks due to the
strong average deposit growth.
The impact of this was a negative 10 basis points to the margin. The margin headwind from incremental lower
asset yields was offset by a lower cost of interest bearing funds and a higher share of [ph] DDA balance – non-
interest-bearing DDA (00:15:46) in the deposit mix. Quarter-over-quarter, our robust net interest income growth
came from loan growth and incremental purchases of securities, and repo agreements, and for the full year, we
expect NII growth of 10% to 11%, excluding the impact of PPP.
Turning to slide 15, the third quarter average loan yield was $361 million, and excluding the impact of PPP, the
adjusted loan yield was 3.56%, down by 2 basis points from 3.58% in the second quarter of 2021.
Turning to slide 16, our average cost of deposits for the third quarter dropped to 12 basis points, an improvement
of 2 basis points from the second quarter. The spot rate on total deposits was 11 basis points as of September
30, also down by 2 basis points from June 30. Our cost of deposits declined as maturing higher rate CDs repriced
to current market rates, and we lowered the rates paid on other accounts.
The average cost of CDs in the third quarter was 35 basis points, a drop of 5 basis points from the second
quarter. In the third quarter, we originated or renewed $5.3 billion of domestic CDs at a blended rate of 19 basis
points and weighted average duration of four months. Over the course of 2021, many of the higher price CDs
have already repriced down. In the fourth quarter, we have $4.1 billion of domestic CDs maturing at a blended
rate of 25 basis points, of which, $900 million have originated when deposit rates were higher at a blended rate of
37 basis points.
Moving on to fee income on slide 17, total non-interest income in the third quarter was $73 million, an increase
from $68 million in the second quarter. Customer-driven fee income and net gains on sales of loans was $63
million, essentially flat compared with the second quarter and up 31% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter

growth in deposit account fees and interest rate swap revenue and SBA loan sale gains were offset by decreases
in lending fees and in wealth management. Year-over-year, the growth in fee income reflects new customer
acquisition, particularly for GTS and FX beyond rebound from COVID related troughs. Beyond quarter-to-quarter
volatility, we are positive about the year-over-year trends in fee income and momentum for future growth.
Moving on to slide 18, third quarter non-interest expense was $205 million. Excluding amortization of tax credits
and other investments [ph] and quite a positive tangible (00:18:19) amortization, adjusted non-interest expense
was $167 million in the third quarter, an increase of $5 million or 3% sequentially. The largest quarter-over-quarter
change was in other operating expenses, which increased largely due to higher loan related expenses and
charitable contributions.
The third quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 35.6% compared with 36.3% in the second quarter. While
achieving industry-leading efficiency, we continue to make investments in people and technology to expand our
banking capabilities and product offerings. With that, I'll now review our updated full year outlook for 2021 on slide
19.
We've updated our full year 2021 outlook relative to a quarter [ph] to go (00:19:06). For the full year of 2021
compared with our full year 2020 results, we expect year-over-year loan growth, excluding PPP, in the range of
10% to 11%, up from the prior range of 9% to 10%. Year-over-year adjusted net interest income growth,
excluding PPP, in the range of 10% to 11%, unchanged from our prior outlook. Our increased loan growth outlook
is a good foundation for robust net interest growth, net interest income growth in 2022, even though it does not
materially shift the full year 2021 growth outlook. Adjusted non-interest expense growth excluding tax credit
amortization of 5%, unchanged from our prior outlook.
Based on our macroeconomic forecasts and loan growth outlook, at this point, we expect to book a negative
provision for credit losses of $10 million in the fourth quarter, similar to what we recorded in the third quarter. This
is a change from our prior outlook of zero provision expense in the second half of the year. We currently expect
that the full year 2021 effective tax rate will be approximately 17%, excluding the impact of tax credit investments.
We also anticipate that the amortization of tax credits and other investments will be approximately $30 million for
the fourth quarter. This is an update from our prior outlook of a 15% full year tax rate.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Dominic for closing remarks.

Hey.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess, Dominic, you mentioned your expectations for strong loan growth into 2022 driven by C&I. Just talk to us,
I mean, you had pretty strong growth even this year, you revised guidance for the last three quarters. As we think
about 2022, why loan growth probably is not going to be somewhere in the mid-teens, 15%, 16% range? Just give
us a sense of like what could be the risk to that level of growth next year, given the rest of the industry is talking
pretty positively about a pickup in loan demand and activity levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I mean, at this point, we see that the trajectory is – for 2022 will be somewhat similar to what we're currently
experiencing. It's too early of a stage right now for us to provide guidance for 2022. We always provide our 2022
guidance in our January – fourth quarter call. So – but, so far, if I look at the pipeline in the fourth quarter, things
are going pretty good. I mean, particularly in the C&I sector that we feel that we will be able to continue to have
that kind of growth based on what we share in our guidance to end the year at 10% to 11% annualized growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just tied to that, you mentioned the loans in the China sub up from $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. Just
remind us in terms of the strategy there, are there things that you're doing a bit differently today versus two or
three years ago that could lead to a lot more growth contribution from the China sub over the next year and going
forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
In terms of China, our – in fact, I would say that overall East West bridge banking strategy, we pride ourselves to
be the financial bridge between the East and the West. And we've always looked at – our value proposition comes

from our knowledge and expertise of knowing the regulatory change in both US and China, and because of that,
we can help business, like Chinese business to do business more effectively in United States and vice versa.
So, we actually are able to, in fact, for the last 12 months, I would say that we benefited tremendously from
continuing to build new business in US that have cross-border banking needs. You see that in our C&I loan
growth, you see that in our – some of our CRE loan growth and absolutely so in FX and treasury management,
fee income growth. So, the cross-border banking business has helped us tremendously in the United States.
Now, the China part and Hong Kong, both Hong Kong and Mainland China, our strategy have always been that
because we have the knowledge, because we also have the presence that will continue to feed good, high quality
cross-border business in US. That is the main part. Now – but in the meantime, obviously, we are still growing in
China. What you've noticed is that the percentage growth of loans in China may be higher than US because the
base is smaller. Keep in mind that we only – I mean, the $1.7 billion is only 4% of our total loan.
So, if next year, they'll grow in a percentage within their own region by, let's say, 15%, 20% of that – it's not
something that's surprising at all. It's something that's just given, simply because that the base is so low. Well,
we're not – we're going to be comfortable to let it grow to whatever the size it should be based on the needs, but
the most important thing is that we are looking at high quality asset growth and clients that is core and they have
business that is expandable, sustainable and profitable.
And because the base is small, so we got plenty of room. So – but we're not out there trying to aggressively grow
the China portfolio just to make sure that even now the percentage or anything like that is all based on what are
the good clients that we can actually do banking with and when we find one, we'll work with them, and that's pretty
much [ph] to (00:26:26) our philosophy. And so far, we've been benefiting tremendously, particularly in US of
these cross-border banking business.

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right, great, thanks. I guess two questions, so first of all, could you just help us think about how to model out
the credit valuation adjustment in industry contract line? I mean, obviously, it was great this quarter, but just want
to understand the sustainability. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, I think the CBA adjustment is really a function of, kind of, assumptions around, kind of, the credit
component of it, but also largely, what's happening with rates, the tenure, swap rate in particular. So honestly, I
think it's hard to model that point-to-point in particular. But I think if you follow as far as what's happening with the

tenure, that's probably the largest indicator that's helpful, Ken, in trying to understand what that [ph] mark is
(00:27:37) going to be quarter-over-quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Understood. Okay. And then just as a second question, your non-interest-bearing deposit growth has just
been outstanding. I think it was up over 17% sequentially this quarter. Can you just talk about what's driving that
growth? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. We're delighted with the growth that we have had in deposits. Across the board, if you look at it from our
retail branches, consumer accounts, a number of accounts have increased, the customers have increased. Small
business, we've been very successful with kind of promotions and then also product packages that we've created
that really meet the needs of our small business customers. I think with that, probably from a dollar perspective,
the largest growth has come in US domestic corporate commercial accounts, and we've been very excited from
the perspective of the investments that we've made the last several years for GTS products, capabilities and
people, really be able to utilize that and help our customers. So, the long and short of it is, we're very excited
about the growth, the customers that we've on boarded and we think that that is something that can continue.
Realistically, I would say, Ken, though, there is a certain amount of – with kind of the stimulus, the kind of the
monetary policies, there is a certain amount of excess deposits in the system and we're realistic about that as
well. But overall, I think the trends are very positive and we think that we can continue this deposit growth
momentum.

Well, we are currently at 75% loan to deposit ratio, so we've got a lot of cushion there, right, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
And it's something that I think that is still – the loan-to-deposit cushion that obviously causing some of the margin
pressure. But, obviously, we have such a strong net interest income growth that our volume will overcome this
margin compression. The way I looked at it is that we got plenty of room. So that would not be a concern for us for
now. And we still expect continued deposit growth, simply because we'll continue to bring in new clients. I look at
the pipeline, well, C&I, there are going to be new clients that we'll be booking. When they come in that we provide
a loan commitment to them, [ph] it (00:30:47) comes with operating accounts and then, excess liquidity for money
market account and so. So, now, I do wanted to mention that it is indeed – back in 2020, in the second half of last
year that due to PPP, we just did quite a tremendously great job and generated a lot of goodwill and brought in a
lot of new clients. And we were able to benefit from that and book a lot of new customers and still continue to
through that goodwill and get new clients referral.
So, I would expect that in – maybe in 2022, maybe that new clients acquisition may not necessarily be as strong
as the last year, year-and-a-half or so, simply because it is somewhat unusual in 2020 for that PPP situation.
But, [ph] these goodwill, sometimes you have one customer has got happy, they'll (00:31:47) tell five, 10 of their
friends and then we'll continue to pick up business. This will be something that I would expect that maybe is going
to continue on for the next several years. But in terms of the velocity of growth, may not necessarily be as strong
from these deposit – sort of commercial deposit side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Yeah. That will make sense, good. And maybe just for my follow-up. Switching to fees, you mentioned
seeing a lot of momentum there for future growth. Was just wondering, you've got a lot of contributing lines here,
where do you expect to see the strongest growth? And I know it's probably difficult, but how are you thinking
about the pace of that growth going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think that for – we – you – if you looked at these different line items, like foreign exchange and the cash
management and treasury management, the – from the deposit side, these are the areas that we have a
tremendous growth because, as we just mentioned about two things, one is that the domestic commercial small,
middle-sized business that are moving their banking relationship over to East West that generate a lot of fee
income in our treasury management line item. The other one cross-border business that I mentioned earlier will
pick up a lot of new cross-border clients, again, foreign exchange fees and also Treasury management area that
those are the two that I would say that pretty much in addition to – I mentioned about PPP and in terms of the
China situation, actually, more US bank may not be as excited about working with Chinese subsidiary company in
United States that we end up benefiting from it. We also have a situation of internal technology improvement. As

we talked about the last two or three years, we have continued to invest in upgrading our technology platform, our
system and our product offerings.
So, these product offerings, particularly in the treasury management area, have put us in a position that we have
the ability to service much larger commercial clients with more complexity in terms of their cash management
needs. So, all of that have resulted in us having these kind of growth. Now, we think they will continue, but in
terms of the pace, volume and so forth, we will – I think that we will need to take a look. I mean, at this point, my
sense is that if we do not continue to innovate and continue to provide – come up with new products, we'll
probably slow down, but East West doesn't stop [ph] working (00:35:00) and then just sit and wait for all the
business to come in. We'll continue in 2022 to develop new product capability and looking to even newer
geographic areas and start identifying new prospect. And through that, we'll continue to upgrade our system too
and provide even better products. And through that, hopefully we'll continue to maintain some sort of momentum
going forward.

I guess shifting back to the growth outlook and the optimism there, can you break down the difference between, I
guess, your expectation that customers increased their own optimism and the utilization rate starts turning back to
normal versus the success you've had with acquiring new customers? Are you expecting that 2022 sees a
normalization of utilization rate? And I guess, if not, what's holding those customers back?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I think that utilization rate would have a lot to do with how the US economy is going to be like in 2022. As we
shared with you at our remarks that in fact the utilization rate, amount of C&I dropped from [ph] 70% to 69%
(00:36:36) just slightly. But, if you look at the loan growth, our C&I loan balance growth was 21% annualized, but
then our commitment growth was higher. Was it 26% or 28%? Something around that range. So, we actually
brought in more customers that we booked more new loans, just that haven't been funded yet. What I looked at in
2022, I would expect that our customer will actually increase the utilization. But while I would expect that even
four or five months ago, it didn't happen. It just keeps coming down. So, it's just a matter of time – it's a matter of
time, I mean, something that I wish I had a crystal ball to predict what the economy is going to be like to give our
clients the confidence to start drawing up the line. But as of today, overall amount, a well-diversified portfolio with

many different industries, somehow it averaged out to more or less the same. And we'll see what it's going to be
like in 2022. It's just like interest rate, you know, every year we wait for a little bit of a hike, it hadn't happened, but
eventually at some point it will happen. So I would expect that the utilization rate also at some point is going to
start rising.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, thanks. And just my follow-up, capital continues to grow. When you look at the dividend payout ratio, it's
under 21%, you have the buyback authorization out there. What are your thoughts on capital management more
broadly, and then the buyback more specifically now that the worst of the COVID fears are behind us?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. First and foremost, our focus on returning the capital to shareholders is the form of strong organic growth
and being able to utilize that in the most optimal way. We do have the authorization outstanding, it's been a while.
So honestly, at this point, we'd go back to the board with any actions that we would take. And that's not something
that we're evaluating at this point in time, quite frankly, because of the growth that we have and the optimism we
have. On the dividend side, generally speaking, on an annual basis, [ph] that's through (39:06) discussion with the
board, we evaluate and we want to make sure that the dividends, payout ratio and the yield are appropriate,
especially relative to our expectations about the utilization of capital and then also relative to other peers.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
So, CRE growth, you mentioned industrial and multi-family being the sources of that, why it was a little slower
than 2Q? What was the level of paydowns in the quarter compared to last quarter? And how do you see that
shaping out in 4Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Generally, we expect that CRE is top. I think on the pricing, we see that as far as a lot of competition. And so, our
overall focus has been clients where maybe we're not just competing on price and structure. Overall, as we look
at the pipeline and what we expect, Brandon, we do think fourth quarter is going to be a little better than third
quarter and then also at this point in time, given the visibility that we have, we also think that the payoffs will
decline slightly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And resi mortgage was once again strong in this quarter, could you just remind us what was the purchase
and refinance mix in volumes? And is a certain regions performing better than others when it comes to residential
mortgage, I know a lot of banks are experiencing more of normalization as far as origination volumes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, Brandon, I don't have those exact stats. But generally speaking, at this point in time, most of the loans that
we're originating are refinancing, are purchase, excuse me, versus refinance that change that's happened for a
period of time. And for us, I think in the markets that we're in and the markets that we have strong branch
presence, as you know, most of these are referrals that come in through our branch network, our – the volume of
origination is predominantly in areas where we have lots of branches, you know, California – Southern California
and Northern California and then also New York Metro.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And lastly, with the provision guidance, with another negative provision expected in 4Q, by just rough
assumes with a charge-offs level of around I guess like second quarter, it looks like the loan loss reserve could be
around $130 million or a little bit below $130 million. Is that kind of a trough level based on your outlook now or
could that go even lower in 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, you know, that's a great question. As you know, the allowance calculation is largely driven on the
macroeconomic outlook. Of course, I think as we look at it and part of the reason, I think where we felt that the
negative – part of – it is driven by the macroeconomic outlook. And as that improves, I think that's why ultimately
we had to book the negative provision. On a go-forward basis, I'll say that that continues to drive it. I think as a
trough perspective, and your numbers or not, you know, I think that's not complex math, there are about $130
million or so. That is something I think that's within the realm of possibility in the fourth quarter. And then if we look
at 2022, depending on the macroeconomic forecast, depending on what we're seeing in the portfolio, I do think
that number could come down from that level.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just following up on the resi question. If I got the number correctly, it
sounded like your originations there were up about $1 billion from a year ago. That seems really strong. I'm
wondering if that's – I'm just wondering what's driving that, because we're really not seeing that across the board
where year-over-year increases are much closer to flat.

Year-over-year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q

Year-over-year I thought the number was [ph] 28% (43:47).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Oh, year-over-year, oh, okay. And so, sorry, can you repeat that question- so you're just saying that for year-to-
date origination is about $1 billion above last year that you're wondering why it is so strong.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah, it just seems very outsized. So I was just wondering what was driving that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So we have a very unique product, right? Most of what we're originating is a reduced stock, but high down
payment, single-family and HELOC product. And I think for our customer base, this is something that's very
attractive for them.

...purchase, refi and HELOC, right? And we have done, I mean, really well, actually, not just for the last 12
months. We have consistently done well with residential mortgage I would say for the last three or four years.
Now, granted, everyone in the banking industry that in the mortgages business have done well, because the rates
have come down and which benefit people to think about refinancing and with COVID, more people are
purchasing homes. And so to that extent, our customers are no different than the market, the only difference that
our customers tend to pay anywhere 40%, 50% or more down payment. But beyond that, I mean, the other
characteristics is more or less the same because the overall market has been really strong and there is a lot of
purchase and refi going on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And as a follow-up, it looked like you got comfortable in terms of where rates were deploying pretty
aggressively into investment securities in the quarter. Any sense of where cash levels could end the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
No. That's a hard question to answer. I can talk about what we did and the deliberate actions we took in the third
quarter. Overall in the third quarter, we knew that we'd have about $300 billion of securities that were called and
matured that we've deployed some of that. Also, the ongoing analysis of cash and the deposit levels that we had,
and then additionally, as we said before, in our prepared remarks, we had $650 million of PPP loans that we
deployed that cash as well. So, we took all this into consideration, generally speaking, of the securities that we did
purchase, we wanted to be mindful with the duration, which was a little bit lower than the existing duration as of
6/30 million of the portfolio.
But just keeping in mind being able to kind of redeploy our excess cash into earning assets, but maintaining kind
of the duration that we think is appropriate, given kind of where interest rates are going. Now that's been our focus
that we've had in the fourth quarter, depending on the cash activity that we have the excess liquidity, certainly this
is something that we're evaluating as well. But what's really not extending the duration out further.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, we didn't hold back much. We have a 5% growth in expenses, which somewhat painful in my view, but then
we need to spend what we need to spend that is that investing into the system, continue to improve our product
capability, and most importantly, pay our people and recruiting, both new talents and then promoting talents
within.
And those are the things that we've been doing year in and year out and we'll continue to do in 2022. Frankly, if
you recall, we used to have, you know, maybe 2% to 3% type of year-to-year expenses increase and then we
ratcheted up to 5%, and then – and the guidance. And so those are kind of things that we because of in
anticipation of inflations out there that we would need to spend what it's appropriate.
And then it also depends on how the economy goes and the business go and then we will continue to spend
prudently. If we continue to grow even stronger that require more manpower, we're not going to shy away from
increasing the expenses to support the business, because the revenue will always take care of itself.
So I always looked at it is that I wouldn't be too focus on, the expense can only go up by a certain percentage
because we'll spend prudently and wisely and whatever we spend is going to add into more profit, more revenues
and more profitability and then allow us to have more sustainable growth, and that pretty much is the philosophy
at East West Bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's great. If I could follow it, it sounds like that 5% already reflects any wage pressures that might be evident
and anything above it, Dominic, would just – would be correlated to driving revenue growth, stronger revenue
growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
At this point, the 5% is what we projected for the end of the year and 2022, obviously, we'll provide additional
guidance.

Hi, thanks. Wanted to ask about loan pricing, you mentioned about the competitiveness for CRE, I was curious
about how it looks on the C&I side? And then more broadly, when I look at the average loan yield in the quarter at
3.61%, I was curious how that compares to new loan originations more broadly?

They are holding up, okay, if we look at, I'll just go through all of them for you. Single-family, if we look at where
we were, we were at on an average of about 4.20 for September. If you look at CRE, including multi-family, we
were at about 3.50 million as far as new loan yields holding steady really from where we were before. And the C&I

Good morning. This is Clark Wright filling in for Gary Tenner. My question pertains to one of those, actually asked
earlier on the call about liquidity deployment. I would appreciate if I could get your thoughts on deposit duration
and how this is impacting your lookout for liquidity deployment and your general strategy to make use of your
balance sheet.

Irene H. Oh A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark Wright Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson Companies
Oh, came in, I'm sorry about that. I would just – essentially I was just looking at your thoughts on deposit duration
and how it's impacting your liquidity deployment strategy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Julianna Balicka A
Director-Investor Relations & Corporate Finance, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So, Clark, this is Julianna filling in for Irene. We will repeat the same pattern. In terms of our modeling of deposit
duration, we take a look at the expected life of the deposit in terms of our modeling for cash deployment.
So, for example, our customers with a long history with us multiple years, we have an expectation of our lifetime
of, say, their demand deposit, customers with demand deposit due to, you know, say, an IPO or some other
corporate action, those are a shorter duration life – expected life of deposit. So we model that in as well in terms
of our forecasting of the cash balances at the organization and then attributing a ability to redeploy that into
whatever is the appropriate earning asset.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
And okay, I'll just add. Thanks, Julianna, for filling in. That overall, as we talked about before, we've seen great
growth in commercial deposits. Operating accounts, whether for small business or for larger companies, those are
long duration assets. I think with that, as with part of our analysis, we also look at what kind of surge deposits they
are. And certainly, as Julianna noted, some of those we will evaluate and look at it and expect a shorter life. But
overall, relative to where we were before, before these last couple of years, before kind of and the changes that
we've been able to make in our deposit base over the last few years, I'd say that deposit duration is something
that has certainly improved.
