Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Great. Thank you, Daniel. Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining the call today to review our fourth
quarter and full year 2020 results. I'm going to start on slide number 5.
I'm incredibly proud of the way our company and teammates responded during these challenging times. This past
year presented one of the most complex operating environments in our company's history as COVID cases
accelerated across all 50 states and that led to considerable uncertainty about the health and welfare of millions
of people and businesses.
The fiscal and monetary response from the government combined with the private sector actions providing relief
to those impacted was necessary and still remains critically important to the recovery. Across our country, we also
confronted the harsh realities of social injustices and racial disparity, requiring difficult but necessary dialogue and
an intensified call to action for everyone. Sadly, COVID appears to be further accelerating these disparities.
As I shared across our company and with our board, the only way we permanently disrupt the flaws in our system
is by each individual making the commitment to change now and after the headlines were less frequent. And
candidly, that's part of the reason I share it again today.
While the year was full of challenges, signs of hope have emerged as we are now taking a meaningful step
forward in the fight against the virus with the rollout of vaccines. And I am proud of how companies and people
are responding and recognizing the need for real and lasting social change. I hope America can unite, heal and
strengthen together.
Further, the sacrifices and work with healthcare, service industry and community-focused leaders and
organizations is a reason for optimism moving forward. At Ally, we've built a culture based on doing it right, rooted
in an authentic set of values and inclusivity. I believe we all have the opportunity to emerge from this difficult
period with a greater appreciation for each other, for life and with an emboldened focus on equality and inclusion.
These elements of our cultural DNA serve as a huge source of strength and continuity across our stakeholders.
Actions reinforcing our values included moving and maintaining 99% of our workforce to work from home while
expanding health, family and financial benefits and utilizing our employee resource groups during critical
moments to listen, share and connect on a personal level.
For our customers, we proudly led the industry with comprehensive COVID relief, with post-deferral performance
remaining strong. We continued expanding our digital products, technologies and services aimed at meeting
customer needs in new and innovative ways, something our modern, nimble, direct platform is well-positioned for
moving forward.
And within our communities, we established the Ally Charitable Foundation, strengthening our ability to make
lasting and meaningful change well into the future. And I am proud of how we demonstrated our humanity more
than anything else. And as you'll see, that bettered our results.
Across all of our businesses, we demonstrated our leading capabilities and growing momentum, which is reflected
in our financial results and outlook. During a year of constant change, we maintained our long-term focus,
something we've done for years as we position the company for ongoing success.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Turning to slide number 6. Full-year 2020 adjusted EPS of $3.03 and core ROTCE of 9.1% demonstrated our
ability to absorb a significant allowance build early in the year while still driving impressive business results and
strong momentum. Revenues of $6.7 billion represented our highest annual result, growing 6% year-over-year
while credit performance exceeded expectations. Jenn will provide more detail on the quarter in a few moments,
but pricing, flows and credit all ended the year on solid footing, and we feel really good about the exit rate into the
new year.
Turning to our business and product offerings, across our growing base of nearly 9 million Ally customers, we
focus on our relentless pursuit to provide differentiated, innovative products, services and experience. Within auto
finance, consumer volume of $35.1 billion was sourced from 12.1 million applications, results that were only
modestly impacted by the COVID environment. As we move into 2021, we're well positioned for an outlook that
indicates rising new and used auto sales as demand persists, OEM production which should gradually replenish
depleted inventories on dealer lots, and some normalization of used values from the record-setting levels we saw
in the third quarter.
Our retail origination yields remain solid, exceeding 7% for the full year, which reflects our dynamic underwriting
approach. I can't emphasize how strong this performance is and [ph] exceeds (00:07:08) margin expansion well
into the future. From a credit perspective, net charge-offs of 96 basis points reinforced a resilient and disciplined
consumer despite elevated unemployment and a challenging backdrop.
Simply put, the combined impact of fiscal stimulus, digital collection tools, and proactive actions implemented this
year have kept losses low. In our insurance business, we generated $1.2 billion in written premium in 2020, while
our $6.3 billion investment portfolio produced over $200 million of investment income. The countercyclical aspects
of this business are a powerful reminder of our ability to drive strong results in a variety of environments.
Ally Bank was an early disruptor and we built the largest direct bank in the US by truly focusing on growth and
retention of the customer. Our growing scalable platform has generated over 10 years of customer and balance
expansion and experienced record-setting growth in 2020. We ended the year with over $124 billion in retail
balances and 2.25 million active customers, a sixfold increase over the past decade.
Deposit growth continues to lower our cost of funds and serves as a gateway to Ally Bank in the expanded suite
of all digital consumer finance products we offer. Trends accelerated this year across each of these products as
depositors with a Home or Invest product grew to 8%, our fourth consecutive year of growth. Ally Home
originations of $4.7 billion increased 74% year-over-year as we continue to expand and enhance our customer
experience and take advantage of a strong refinance market.
Ally Invest self-directed accounts of 406,000 expanded 17% year-over-year, while customer assets of $13.4
billion increased 70%. Ally Lending volume of $503 million grew 75%, while entering home improvement and retail
verticals complementing our established healthcare offering. We now have over 1,800 provider relationships, a
60% increase from 2019. The opportunity across each of these digitally driven products to grow and deepen
customer relationships provides us with long-term organic growth runway.
Our corporate finance segment generated strong results driven by experienced teams, focused execution, and
prudent underwriting. Our $6 billion held for investment portfolio grew 6% year-over-year while credit performance
remains stable against a shifting backdrop. Over the past several years, we've generated steady growth while
maintaining a disciplined underwriting approach. The outlook for each of these businesses continues to
accelerate, reflecting years of steady, disciplined, and consistent execution. I'm fully confident in our ability to
keep driving meaningful value for our customers, communities, and stakeholders in the years ahead.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Turning to slide number 7, we highlighted some of the competitive advantages last quarter and it bears repeating
again on the strength and position of the company's core businesses. Within auto, we're a full-service partner to
18,700 dealers. That's the highest level in the history of our company, reflecting growth from both established and
emerging players. Scale of this magnitude provides us with broad market insights. It allows us to generate
impressive volumes with attractive returns. Our industry-leading field teams, strong service levels, and expanding
use of modernized tools and technology will continue to set us apart from the competition.
Throughout the year, we streamlined user experiences and enhanced digital capabilities across our servicing,
underwriting, and smart auction platforms. We continue to employ the use of advanced data analytics in 2020,
leading to our fifth consecutive year of improved auto decision levels and reduced response times.
Within insurance, our comprehensive protection products continue to enhance value for over 4,200 dealers and
2.6 million customers in the US. Within our consumer banking products, we differentiated through frictionless
experiences built on data intelligence, innovative technologies and mobile investments. New savings tools rolled
out this year have been hugely popular, and we crossed over 1 million consumer savings goals. We made
significant progress against our long-term strategic objectives in 2020 as ongoing consumer demand for digitally
based experiences accelerated.
On slide number 8, trends across each of the quadrants demonstrates the near-term results of the long-term
planning and execution. EPS in the upper left improved throughout the year, reaching a record level in Q4 driven
by a combination of core revenue growth and diversified sources of income. Tangible book value in the bottom
right grew year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter to $36.05 as our earnings more than offset the CECL day one
impact of $2.70 and significant reserve build in the first quarter. Values, culture and disciplined execution will
continue to underpin our approach as we build upon this accelerating momentum in the years ahead.
And with that, I'm going to pass it to Jenn to go through all the detailed financial results.

Jennifer LaClair
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, JB, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking our Ally teammates for their consistent
operating and financial performance throughout the many challenges of 2020. Their commitment to our values,
hard work and perseverance is reflected in our strong and accelerating financial trajectory.
Let's turn now to slide 9. Net revenue of $6.7 billion for full year 2020 extended for the sixth consecutive year,
representing a 5% CAGR over this timeframe. The sustained top line trajectory reflects margin improvement
across both sides of the balance sheet, driven by over a decade of customer growth and relationship deepening.
Our balance sheet positioning and revenue momentum this year demonstrate our ability to navigate challenging
environments and drive improved financial results in the years ahead.
Turning to slide 10, we've included details on our balance sheet reflecting three primary dynamics. First, asset
expansion and diversification. We ended 2020 at $176 billion in assets, a $33 billion increase since 2014. Retail
auto loan growth has outpaced the decline on lease exposure, reflecting our strategy to broaden our capabilities
and distribution. Corporate finance has tripled in size to $6 billion through prudent entry into additional verticals,
and we've grown capital-efficient mortgage and investment securities portfolios and added Ally Lending. We
expect continued organic loan growth and return optimization moving forward.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
The second driver has been the transformation of our funding profile, shown in the bottom left, where deposit
growth and retention have increased stability and reduced cost of funds. Since 2014, our deposit portfolio has
nearly doubled to $137 billion, now representing 85% of overall funding. As a result, higher cost legacy unsecured
debt has declined by 60% and we've reduced reliance on other wholesale funding including securitizations,
facilities and other borrowings.
And third, optimization of retail auto portfolio yields, where we've consistently generated improved risk-adjusted
returns through expanding dealer relationships and increased application flow. Full-year new origination yields
exceeded 7% for the third consecutive year, even as benchmark rates have declined 150 to 200 basis points over
the past two years. Our consistent pricing reflects the strength of the retail auto asset class and our leading
competitive position.
Across both sides of our balance sheet, we have reduced NIM volatility by managing to a relatively neutral
interest rate risk management position, which is evidenced in stable full-year net interest margin. From here, we
expect sustained revenue and margin expansion, a key differentiator for Ally.
Let's turn to slide 11 to review detailed results. I'll begin with significant items on the bottom of the page. Other
revenue, including impacts related to an early paydown of FHLB debt, where again this quarter we utilized surplus
liquidity to accelerate cost of funds benefits and gains related to corporate investments and a legacy mortgage
portfolio sale executed in Q4.
Noninterest expense included our contribution to the Ally Charitable Foundation and an auto legal settlement
that's subject to court approval will fully resolve an outstanding class action case described in our 10-K and 10-Q
filings.
Moving to the top of the page, Q4 net financing revenue, excluding OID, was $1.312 billion, our highest quarterly
results to-date, increasing 9% linked quarter and 13% year-over-year, powered by steady loan and lease growth,
stable earning asset yields, declining cost of funds and proactive liability management as we reduced excess
cash.
Adjusted other revenue of $567 million reflected strong realized investment gains, robust mortgage fee income
and the significant items mentioned earlier. While we remain opportunistic generating investment gains, ongoing
other revenue expansion will be sourced from steady growth across insurance, mortgage invest and our smart
option platform. Provision expense of $102 million declined linked quarter and year-over-year as consumer and
commercial performance remained solid and reserves declined due to macroeconomic favorability.
Noninterest expense trends excluding the onetime mentioned earlier, reflects ongoing business investments to
drive long term customer and revenue expansion. Q4 GAAP and adjusted EPS of $1.82 and $1.60 respectively,
reflects a strong finish to a challenging year and are a direct reflection of our talented workforce, loyal customer
relationships, and several years of diligent focus and execution, transforming our balance sheet.
Before moving on, I'll address full year 2020 noninterest expenses of $3.8 billion. The year-over-year increase
reflects nearly $80 million of insurance business expansion as variable commission and weather-related
increases reflect growing written premium volume from prior years; $150 million of investments supporting
business, growth, customer capabilities, technology enhancements, and our growing brand; and $173 million of
significant onetime items covered earlier and a goodwill impairment in Q2. Importantly, we will deliver positive
operating leverage and efficiency improvements in 2021.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Let's turn to slide 12. Net interest margin excluding OID of 2.92% improved 25 basis points linked quarter and 26
basis points year-over-year. Earning asset yields of 4.34% remained stable quarter-over-quarter, a trend we
expect to persist as we patiently redeploy excess liquidity in towards organic growth and balance sheet
management. Our outlook for 2021 embeds assumptions for retail auto origination yields in the mid-6% range and
a decline in used car values of 3% on a full year basis.
Average earning assets of $178.5 billion, expanded quarter-over-quarter among all loan and lease portfolios
except mortgage where prepayment activity reflected persistently low rates. Notably, average commercial auto
balances rose $1.2 billion quarter-over-quarter, an 11% increase from the trough in July as auto inventory levels
continued to build.
Cost of funds improved 27 basis points, the sixth consecutive quarter-over-quarter decline reflecting improved
deposit costs and ongoing wholesale funding optimization. $2.2 billion of unsecured debt matured in 2020 with a
weighted average coupon of 6.6% as we opportunistically issued $2.8 billion in new bonds at a blended rate of
3.1%, less than half the cost of the mature debt. Given strong deposit flows, we did not access ABS markets and
reduce brokers' deposits and FHLB borrowing levels.
Stable asset yields, declining cost of funds, and liability management will contribute to ongoing NIM expansion in
2021 and beyond. Retail deposit trends are on slide 13. Total deposits grew to $137 billion, powered by $20.6
billion of retail growth, our highest annual growth ever. Existing customers drove over 50% of balanced growth
while retention of 96% remained industry leading. Our 2.25 million customers grew 14% year-over-year, while
deposit customers within Ally Home or Ally Invest account expanded for the 15th consecutive quarter. The
momentum generated by our customer-centric approach is reinforced in the accelerating trends across all our
digital offerings.
Over half our brokerage account openings and mortgage volumes are sourced from existing customers, reflecting
the organic growth opportunities within Ally Bank. Throughout the year, we rolled out new innovative digital tools
aimed at helping customers set and achieve their financial goals, and we continue to receive several industry
awards throughout the year, and we're pleased in Q4 to be named Best Online Bank by Money Magazine for the
eighth time in the past 10 years.
Turning to capital on slide 14. Q4 CET1 of 10.6% reflected strong earnings and lower risk-weighted assets
stemming from lower commercial floor plan balances. Last week, we announced a Q1 common dividend of $0.19
per share and a share repurchase program of up to $1.6 billion for 2021. We're pleased to be able to resume
buybacks. And while we await guidance from the Federal Reserve regarding activities beyond Q1, we remain
confident in the positioning of our balance sheet, our proven approach to risk management and our robust capital
position.
At these levels, we remain well above our 9% internal target and have $3.7 billion in excess above the 8% SEB
requirement. Capital deployment priorities remain centered around investing in the growth of our businesses,
delivering innovative and differentiated products and driving long-term shareholder value.
Turning to slide 15, asset quality remains strong. While we observed an expected linked quarter seasonal uptick
across our loss metrics, trends improved considerably versus prior year. Results were driven by broad-based
consumer and commercial resilience, as consolidated NCOs of 0.67% declined 24 basis points year-over-year.
In the upper right, charge-offs of $198 million declined $92 million, compared to prior year driven by retail auto. In
the bottom left, the Q4 retail auto net charge-off rate of 1.01% declined 48 basis points year-over-year, reflecting

the combined impact of lower frequency and improved severity, as customer payment behavior remained solid
and used car values remained elevated.
In the bottom right, early- and late-stage delinquencies remained strong, ending meaningfully below prior-year
levels. Taken together, credit trends reflect the high utility of auto, disciplined underwriting, effective servicing
strategies and a resilient consumer, benefiting from lower discretionary spend and government stimulus.
Let's turn to slide 16 to review coverage and reserve detail. Given favorable credit trends and improved
macroeconomic indicators, consolidated coverage of 2.78%, and retail auto reserves of 3.95% moved modestly
lower to end the year. Retail auto reserve of $2.9 billion remained well-positioned for elevated pandemic-related
NCOs.
Retail auto coverage remains 2.5 times higher than 2019 ending reserves and nearly 20% higher than CECL Day
1 levels. Our baseline forecast assumes unemployment remains elevated throughout 2021, ending above 6%.
And consistent with prior quarters, we continue to exclude any stimulus-related impacts.
While we are encouraged by the underlying trends of our portfolios and confident in our ample reserves, we
recognize the continued uncertainty driven by COVID-19.
On slide 17, I'll review auto segment highlights. Net financing revenue expanded year-over-year reflecting growth
in the retail margin and strong lease gains. Used car prices shown in the bottom right moderated throughout the
quarter but continued generating higher year-over-year gains per vehicle. Execution within our auto reflects our
diversified full spectrum capabilities, expanded market reach, experienced underwriting and growing use of
technology across our products.
The proven ability to meet and adapt to the needs of our dealers is reflected in our strong application flows,
pricing trends, and overall improved risk-adjusted returns. Detailed origination and asset trends are on slide 18.
Auto originations of $9.1 billion in the quarter increased $1 billion year-over-year and represented our highest Q4
in three years.
We maintained a dynamic disciplined approach to underwriting this year, evidenced by stable FICO and nonprime
trends. In the bottom left, ending consumer assets grew year-over-year and sequentially ending at $83.1 billion
driven by retail and lease expansion. On the bottom right, average commercial assets ended at $22.4 billion, up
quarter-over-quarter as inventory levels have gradually improved over the past five months.
Turning to insurance results on slide 19. Core pre-tax income of $72 million increased $7 million linked quarter
and declined $13 million year-over-year. Written premiums of $312 million declined seasonally linked quarter,
while the year-over-year decline reflected stable F&I but lower commercial activity resulting from lower floorplan.
Notably, commercial volumes declined by less than half the rate of vehicle inventory, reflecting ongoing new
business expansion across our growing dealer base. Overall, we were pleased with the resilience and counter-
cyclic value of the insurance business throughout 2020, delivering core pre-tax income growth fueled by record
earned premiums and strong realized investment gains.
Turning to slide 20, corporate finance core income of $63 million grew $4 million quarter-over-quarter and $14
million year-over-year, reflecting expanding assets and steady credit performance. HFI ending balances of $6
billion increased linked quarter and year-over-year. Asset-based lending now comprises 50% of the portfolio
compared to 43% a year ago and 25% in 2014. Unfunded commitments of $4.1 billion reflect our ability to expand

amid a challenging backdrop. Portfolio metrics reinforced our continued prudent underwriting approach and
operating execution.
Moving to slide 21, mortgage pre-tax income of $7 million declined quarter-over-quarter, but increased year-over-
year, reflecting strong gain on sale results partly offset by the ongoing impact of elevated prepayment activity.
Direct-to-consumer originations of $1.4 billion represented our strongest quarter since launching in 2016.
The low mortgage rate environment resulted in robust refinancing activity, accounting for 70% of Q4 volume. Our
digital end-to-end offering continues to resonate with consumers. Over half of originated volume comes from
existing depositors. Average cycle times have continuously improved, ending the year in the 40- to 45-day range
while our NPS scores in the upper 50s are industry-leading and reinforce the frictionless experience we're
delivering.
I'll wrap up on slide 22 with our financial outlook. We've continued to demonstrate the expanding earnings power
of the franchise with significant opportunities ahead, assuming a gradually improving economic environment. As I
mentioned at the start, our financial trajectory will be driven by embedded balance sheet tailwinds, ongoing pricing
optimization within our established businesses and organic growth across our expanded product offerings.
ROTCE will grow to 12% in 2021 before expanding to mid-teens in 2022 and 2023. NIM expansion of over 3% will
drive net financing revenue growth in the mid-teens year-over-year. Adjusting for significant items, other revenue
will steadily grow, fueled by our broader set of consumer offerings and ongoing insurance expansion. And as a
reminder, we embed modest investment gains in our outlook. These factors will drive PPNR expansion and
positive operating leverage as revenue growth outpaces expenses. Based on pandemic-related uncertainty
reflected in our reserves, we expect NCOs to peak in 2021 before stabilizing in 2022 and 2023.
I'll close by reiterating the gratitude and pride I have in our Ally teammates who drove our results and positioned
us for success by doing it right for our customers, communities and our shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn it back to JB.

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Jenn. I'll wrap up with a few comments on slide number 23. I want to thank my teammates for their
tremendous efforts during 2020. The resolve they've shown in balancing the myriad of personal and family
obligations while working from home and taking care of our customers serves as a testament to our ability to do it
right. And that reinforces the pride I have in leading our company. The trust and transparency that exists inside
Ally is simply energizing.
To our customers and communities, our relentless work will continue as we preserve and build upon the trust and
loyalty you continue to show in us. And regardless of challenges we may face in the weeks and months ahead,
we will continue to lead with our values and focus on these consistent priorities as we continue to enhance long-
term value for all of our stakeholders.
Daniel, that's I think it for the prepared remarks, and we'll turn it to you for Q&A.

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So, maybe to just dig in a little bit more on the ROTCE progression. So, JB, Jenn, the bank is clearly benefiting
from the environment as well as investments that you've made in the business and bringing down funding costs,
optimizing on the asset side. So, can you maybe just dig in a little bit more on the drivers of getting us to 15%
returns? And I think more importantly, can you talk about the ability to sustain these returns, particularly as the
interest rate environment may evolve over time and what are some of the drivers to doing that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Appreciate the question, Ryan. I'll jump in and JB may want to add. But the progression to the mid-
teens ROTCE, I think you described it really well, it will be revenue-driven positive operating leverage. I just
mentioned the NII trajectory next year which will be progressing into the mid-teens, coupled with the fact that we'll
continue to see other revenue expand over time minus some of those one-times.
So, when you wrap that all up, we're expecting total revenue next year to be around 9% or so. And so really nice
positive operating leverage driven by that revenue growth, coupled with the fact that on the credit side, we do
expect that to migrate more towards normalized levels as we exit 2021 and into 2022 and 2023. So those are
some of the big dynamics there.
I would absolutely expect that the 15% is sustainable, and I think that's due to all of the drivers that we kind of just
described this morning around consistent customer growth, continued value add across every one of our
businesses. We don't see any signs of stopping in the auto segment, continuing to groom relationships, grow
relationships, deals per relationship. And just our positioning in the market couldn't be any better than it is today,
and we don't see any sign of that stopping over the next several years.

You slide over to the deposit business and you look at the 10 years of sustained customer growth and really the
transition from customers that were chasing price to really now customers that have bought into the digital
transformation, COVID has certainly helped with that. But I do think that is a permanent shift in customer – just
propensity to purchase digitally. And with cash-rich balance sheets across direct banks as well as the entire
industry, I don't think we're going to see a lot of appetite around increased pricing on the deposit side.
And then last but certainly not least, just the rapid scaling that we've seen in our newer customer segments, every
one of our newer customer segments is up 70-plus percent this quarter. And you just continue to see that added
value and the added ability for us to diversify our revenue into these higher return products whether that's Ally
Lending, our Invest product as well as mortgage as well. So maybe a long-winded answer, but bottom line here is
really confident in getting to that 15% in short order and sustaining it over the long term.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks for all the color. And maybe if I can dig in a little bit further on the credit expectations, so, Jenn, a
couple of things. I think you mentioned 3% decline in used car prices, unemployment ending above 6%. And I
also think you mentioned that charge-offs are going to peak in 2021.
So, can you just give us a little bit more color on where you see charge-offs headed? And then second, I think you
said that you think losses are returning to more normal levels in 2022 and 2023. What is embedded in the 12%
reserve – in the 12%-plus returns in terms of where the reserve is headed? Is there any assumptions of reserve
releases, and how long would you expect until we actually get back to that pre-COVID level on the reserve front?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, Ryan, maybe let me start with some of the assumptions around reserves and then I'll get to the MCO
trajectory. But it's embedded in our reserves and you were listening really well. You pretty much captured it. We
have a pretty adverse macroeconomic scenario embedded in our modeling. So, we use a November forecast.
We're exiting 2020 at about 8% unemployment rate. It might break down to just above 6% at the end of this year.
And because we have a short RNS forecast, we will revert to a mean that's over 6.5% in unemployment. So,
yeah, there is definitely some adversity built into that macroeconomic forecast. I'll also remind you that we have
not built any stimulus benefits into our reserve trajectory. So, if you think about stimulus, that has already been
rolled out. But new stimulus potentially on the horizon, as well as the fact that consumer spending has dropped,
and we're seeing savings rates at really all-time high level or highest levels we've seen in recent future.
So, embedded in our reserve is a lot of kind of conservative assumptions. And so, I do think depending on
macros, depending on the continued performance of the consumer, there could be some upside if we continue to
roll through 2021. So, that's some context around the reserve. Embedded in those reserves, we have NCOs really
starting to accelerate in the first quarter, second quarter of this year, and peaking in Q3 and Q4 before returning
to more normalized levels into 2022 and 2023.
So, bottom line here is, we are well reserved. We've taken the pain through the income statement in 2020, could
potentially be some upside as you think about macro-outperformance and consumer outperformance. And then
last but not least, we do not model any kind of reserve releases in our forecast that the reserve level will migrate
down as we run through NCOs assuming that the projections play out as I just described.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now
open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. And that set of answers actually answers a lot of the questions, but maybe we could drill down a
little bit into – on the deposit side or the funding side. I mean, one of the things that we've talked about over the
years is both optimizing your mix of funding overall and then your kind of deposit pricing. And some of the
comments that you made sounded like you think that's relatively near given the liquidity at yourselves and some
of your peers. Could you just talk about the opportunities there and what that could mean to your cost of funds?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Thank you for the question, Moshe. So, a couple things. Just first on the cost of funds trajectory. I
think this quarter is a really nice reflection of what we're expecting to see as we continue to roll through 2021 and
2022 which is that cost of funds will migrate down. It reflects a couple of things, the full run rate impact of the OSA
reductions this year, the CD repricing that will continue throughout 2021 and 2022. You think about CDs are
rolling off at 2% and rolling back on at material levels under 1%.
And then to your point on other funding sources, the excess cash we have on the opposite side of the balance
sheet will be used in part to kind of replace FHLB, our broker deposits. We've terminated our demand notes
programs and we haven't been active in the ADS markets either. So, we see other sources of funding rolling
down. At the same time, we continue to see overall deposit growth and pricing move down as well. So, hopefully
that gives you a bit of color, Moshe, just on what we're expecting but I think this quarter kind of really summarizes
it perfectly and we'd expect that trajectory to continue.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Got it. And I mean I think the – you made a very strong point about the impact of the margin on revenue growth in
2021 but it does sound like there's some of that that extends kind of beyond and provides further lift even if there
are some elements of current profitability that are kind of better than normal.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Absolutely, Moshe. This is a trend that we'd expect over the next several quarters. And then, your first
question, you did kind of allude to market pricing. I mean, we have cash-rich balance sheets across the direct
bank, liability stocks have been optimized. And so, there's not a – I don't believe there's a whole lot of appetite
across the industry to see pricing increases in 2021 or beyond. And of course, that's the dynamic around loan

2021.

Betsy L. Graseck Q

Hi. Good morning.

Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Morning, Betsy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hi, Betsy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. One quick follow-up and then a separate question. But the rate environment that you're looking for, could
you just help us understand, just using the forward-curve results, what is embedded in your outlook? And if rates
move higher, does that materially change your thoughts around NIM?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Betsy, a couple of things. So, we're not embedding any rate increases into our projections right now. But
the interesting thing is if you do consider a rise and more rapidly rising rate environment, we're really confident in
continuing to hit these higher NIM levels. And that's – all of the dynamics that we have on pricing in auto on the
asset side as well as in deposits, we think, will be persistent in almost any rate environment. I mean, you never
want to say that 100%. But as we look at a variety of different rate forecasts, we continue to see that NIM will
increase, just because of the strength of the pricing we have on both sides of the balance sheet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So, you're saying that if the short end starts moving up that you can maintain the spread relative to what
you're getting on the auto side?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I think if we do see rates rise, I think it'll be a positive on the asset side. If you think about LIBOR-
based commercial floorplan. And I think, if anything, if you see any interest rate increases across the curve, that's
only a net positive for some of our longer-duration assets like investment securities or auto book, mortgage, et
cetera.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then just separately on loan demand and the portfolio and how it's been migrating, maybe you can give
us just some sense on what you're seeing on the ground, demand for both used and new. Asking the question
because one of the pushbacks I get on [ph] every call (00:44:18) on Ally is, well, eventually, everyone is going to
have one, two, or three cars, whatever they need. So, shouldn't loan demand pull back? So, a little color on that.
And if you could give us a sense as to how the portfolio has been migrating from a credit perspective in the
various buckets, prime, non, near-prime, subprime? I asked that question because the other pushback I get is
how used car prices are so strong, that's why credit is doing so well. When used car prices start to stabilize or
come down slightly year-on-year, you're going to see the credit quality come through. And I just wanted to get
your sense as to what you're seeing there so we can better address those questions we're getting from investors.
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Okay. Sure. Thanks, Betsy. A lot in there. Let me try to tackle it one at a time. I mean, I think on auto, what I'd
direct you to is the performance. And our exit run rate in terms of volumes, in terms of pricing continues to persist,
and we really don't see that stopping. And a couple of dynamics there. One is certainly COVID is helping. We've
seen a shift in spend from services to durables, and the whole environment around COVID impact on appetite for
ride share or mass transit has obviously really spurred demand for personal vehicle ownership. So that is a net
plus. But I will say just the resiliency of consumer balance sheets, the high savings rates, above and beyond that
dynamic, there is demand that has persisted kind of pretty much off the charts.
The second thing that I would say is, if you look at just this market, it's a very large and fragmented market and
we have differentiated capabilities and we see in kind of any environment the ability to continue to grow dealers,
dealer relationships, increase apps per dealer and continue to persist in terms of both originations as well as
pricing.
And then lastly, keep in mind our forecast and our forecast in 2021 and beyond does not embed a whole lot of
growth. I mean, we're – we have, I think, achievable assumptions in our guide. We're guiding towards this mid-
$35 billion or $35 billion in originations and we're assuming that pricing actually comes down about 50 basis
points. So, I really think there's strong demand in this environment. I think there's persistent opportunity for us
because of our model. And last but not least, the guide does not have really aggressive assumptions.
And then on your questions on credit, Betsy, just a couple of things that I'd say there. I'd say the entire book is
really performing much better than expected, and that's kind of all cycle band, all areas of the book. We're not
seeing any kind of issues in particular customer segments. It's really been broad-based outperformance.

And on your question on vehicle prices, losses will be reflective of frequency as well as severity. If you look at
frequency, you'll see delinquencies across 30-plus down over 1%, 50-plus continues to come down as well. And
so, frequency metrics are all trending very strong. And then on a severity, we'll see. I mean, we are expecting a
decline of about 3% in used vehicle prices in 2021. I think there's a bull case around outperforming that. Most of it
is in – the decline is in the back half of 2021. But as I said, if there's persistent demand for new and used, I think
we could outperform that. But that 3% is, again, built into the guide. And as I described in response to Ryan's
question, there's a lot of moving pieces and parts around credit, but I'm not overly worried about the severity side
of it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So then, when we're looking at the net charge-offs that should come with what you're baking in for unemployment
and the 3% down in auto, does that get us to kind of a normalized loss rate of 1.3% to 1.6%, or is that kind of a
decent range or do you have a different outcome?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, this year, we are expecting NCOs – or we've modeled NCOs to increase above that level. Our reserve
is at 3.95%. As I mentioned earlier, we're expecting NCOs to really start accelerating more reflective of frequency
versus severity here in the first half and really peaking in Q3 and Q4 and, Betsy, with the 3.95% reserve level that
those NCOs are higher than that 1.3% number.
Now, as we exit 2021, we would absolutely expect NCOs to migrate back into that more normalized range of kind
of 1.3% to 1.6% that you've seen historically. But we do have those pandemic-related NCOs accelerating here in
2021 and potentially room to outperform that.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on some of the questions and comments before maybe just focusing
on the auto yields. Those have been pretty resilient suggesting it could be worse, I guess. Maybe you guys could
talk about the competition there and the environment. Is there something different about this environment where
you're not seeing a lot of competitive pressure on those yields? And then maybe just broadly in terms of thinking
about the risks to the targets that you guys have provided, taking the economy aside, what are those risks?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Okay. So, a couple of things there just in terms of auto yields and competition. I mean, Sanjay, as you know, this
is always a really competitive space. And I think everyone is seeing kind of the performance of this asset class
through 2020 and it's been one of the stronger across the consumers. So, competition is always strong. I think we
could see some more competition heading throughout 2021 here. But in the belly of the curve where we're
playing, we continue to see a lot of opportunity to grow and to put price in the market. But we are mindful of that
and that's why we have baked in kind of a 50-basis-point reduction in retail auto origination pricing this year.
When I talk to the team heading here in January, I think they're really pleased with what they saw exiting 2020
and even more pleased with what they're seeing at the outset here in 2021.
And then, second, just with inventory levels continuing to be pressured and really pressured here starting the first
quarter because of the strong demand I described, I think used vehicle pricing and pricing overall will remain
strong. And then – sorry.

On the risks [indiscernible] (00:51:52)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Oh, risk. Okay. Risk to the forecast. Okay. Sanjay, I think if we reflect on 2020, I think if we learned anything, it's
that things can change very rapidly. And so, what I would say the big risk for us is just to be mindful of this
environment. I mean, we have a lot of changing political landscape, changes potentially to the tax rate, to
regulation, to consumer spend, consumer behavior. I mean, I think we felt 2020 was quite a roller coaster ride.
And I mean, I think we're incredibly well-positioned to navigate any environment and our performance this year
demonstrated that.
But we're mindful of potential volatility to come, and that would be the biggest risk if we did see anything. But I
think, as I reflect, great performance this year, really well-positioned for next year, and a variety of rate
environments, I think we've established a strong reserve. So, feel really good about where we are but just want to
be mindful of the environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I think you guys have done a great job. Just a follow-up on M&A, just curious, JB, any thoughts on where there
might be opportunities if there are opportunities? I know consumer lending has been a focus at points in time. I
mean, is that something you're looking to get larger in? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, Sanjay, I'd say we really like the position of the existing businesses and the state of the company
right now. And obviously, Jenn and I announced the – with our board, announced the large capital return
program. So, I think, in the short term, we're more kind of hunkered down, focused on scaling our – the existing
businesses and the newer businesses. Longer term, I think as we have said for quite some time, I mean, the
unsecured space we think fits well with the overall consumer position of Ally. We like the asset class. We think it
can generate the right types of returns, but we got to be smart on that. And so, I think, in the near term, it's more
kind of head down, focus on what we have in-house today, but you always sort of stay open to things to come.
So, nothing imminent, though.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. JB, I'm sorry if I missed this. I was in a different call. But I had a big-picture
question for you. Ally's net interest margin performance during the rate hike cycle that started in late 2015 and
what we've seen from you guys so far in this [indiscernible] (00:54:34) environment along with the strong credit
performance of positive operating leverage and the ROTCE trajectory that you guys have laid out. It feels like
we're setting up for the investment community to gain greater comfort with the – through the cycle performance of
auto as an asset class. So, the ability for you guys to deliver on the guidance you laid out is obviously critical. But
could you kind of characterize that as beatable or aspirational, maybe just give us a sense of how much
conviction you guys have? Just overall high-level thoughts would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Sure, Bill. Thanks for the question. And obviously Jenn can go through any of the details on it. But I think inside
the house, we have this kind of pound to outperform mentality that exists. So, I think Jenn has highlighted what's
embedded in the forecast, so I think obviously we put the 12-plus. And that's our focus really, continue driving
strong disciplined execution.
And I think what you're really starting to see come through now in the results is a function of the past several
years of work and very disciplined execution, the businesses scaling really strong positions. So, we feel really
good about the state of the company now and the sustainability of earnings. And certainly, as you pointed out, the
margin is going to be a big component of that. And Jenn hit all the highlights of several years of kind of 7-plus
percent yields on the asset side, and you're starting to still see the book migrate up to these new origination yields
at a time when deposit costs and funding costs overall continue to come down.
And Jenn and her team, I just can't say it enough what our treasury team and Jenn has been doing to continue
optimizing the liability structure. I mean, we've been very aggressive there the past couple of quarters obviously in
trades we've done on the FHLB side which just further gives us confidence and strength going forward. So, I
mean, it's been – it's really been fun and energizing to see the company starting to really strut its stuff. But we've
got a high degree of confidence in kind of what we're going to be able to deliver going forward. Jenn, obviously,
you've got the details. So...

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
JB, I think you've summarized that extremely well. And maybe I just offer two points to add on. One is, Bill, on the
pricing side, a lot of that as JB just summarized is already embedded. Right? So, we've got front book, back-book
repricing dynamics in retail auto. And there's kind of no stopping that.
And similarly, on the deposit side, the trajectory to come really reflects that robust positioning that we have across
the entire liability stuff. So, a lot of that is kind of hard coded into our metrics and our forecast. And then on the
reserve, I think I mentioned in prior question just – there's a lot of assumptions in there that are fairly adverse. And
so, our view today is that we've taken the pain. Our reserves have peaked. And so, potentially, there could be
some upside there.
And then to your question around kind of through-the-cycle performance on auto, we're not projecting any change
to kind of our day one CECL assumptions as reserves normalize. And so, if we continue to outperform at this
level, potentially, there could be some kind of just reverse rating of the entire asset class, again not embedded in
the forecast.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research
Got it. Thanks, Jenn. Thanks, JB. That's very helpful. Separately, there's been a lot of focus on dealer floorplan
levels taking longer to return back to historical levels and just hoping that you could comment on how you guys
are thinking about the risk that dealers will be running with less inventory than they have historically.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A

Yeah, I...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research
Or do we revert?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, Bill, I guess, our base case sort of calls for a slow reversion to more normalized levels, and obviously, you'll
see some offset in our cash balance positions when that starts to happen. But I think the real reality is it's been
much slower than the industry expected to see. Now, obviously, that's impacted used car pricing and used car
strength in the used car market overall. So, while you don't have as many new cars on the lot, the demand by
consumers still remains. It's still very strong. And so, they continue to shift and use.
So, I think our base forecast sort of calls for that slow factory ramp back up, more new cars on lot, and that's
creating a little bit of the more softer used car pricing that – used car prices that Jenn alluded to. But we're still a
ways away. I mean, while we did see some modest improvement, I think under $1 billion quarter-over-quarter,
we're a long way from kind of the $30-plus billion levels that we would have expected in a normal environment.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. When we look at the day one reserve level to today, there's basically a
60-basis-point addition. When you think about the duration of the loans, that equates to about 25 basis points a
year on an annualized charge-off – on NCO rate.
Given that there has been substantial amortization in the portfolio since we've entered the COVID scenario,
cumulative losses are way below original expectations. And at this point, essentially about 25% of the book has
been underwritten in a post-COVID environment. Is there a huge disconnect between the macro assumptions that
you guys are using to set the CECL reserve and the actual sort of bottoms-up experience that you're really seeing
in the portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Rick, appreciate your very well-done summary there. Absolutely. I mean we are seeing a disconnect across
macroeconomic factors and the servicing performance, whether you look at 30-plus, 60-plus or for the loss
metrics. That being said, we continue to operate in an environment of uncertainty. And so, as I described earlier,
we've been prudent and balanced around setting a reserve using the historical correlations to the macros and not
embedding a lot of stimulus.
To your point, I do think there could be some upside should, A, the macros continue to outperform because they
have been outperforming and, B, if consumers continue to be as resilient as they proven to be through 2020 and
that's some of the upside not only on the reserves but also on the NCO trajectory I described earlier.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Yeah. I like the terminology of correlation to macros because that's a lot of what we try to do. And I'll agree
with you, it has not been nearly as predictive as it has been in the past.
