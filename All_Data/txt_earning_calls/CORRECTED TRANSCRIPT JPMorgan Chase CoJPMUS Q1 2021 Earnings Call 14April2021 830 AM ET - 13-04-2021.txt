Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2021 Earnings
Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the
presentation. Please stand by.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief
Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation which, as always, is
available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.
Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14.3 billion, EPS of $4.50 on revenue of $33.1 billion, and
delivered a return on tangible common equity of 29%. Included in these results are two significant items: $5.2
billion of net credit reserve releases, which I'll cover in more detail shortly; and a $550 million contribution to the
Firm's Foundation in the form of equity investments.
Touching on a few highlights, we saw another strong quarter in CIB. In fact, net income was an all-time record,
with IB fees up 57% year-on-year, reflecting continued robust activity, and Markets up 25% year-on-year as the
environment remained favorable in January and February, although it did start to normalize in March.
In AWM, we had record net long-term inflows of $48 billion this quarter. And deposits of $2.2 trillion were up 36%
year-on-year and 5% sequentially as the Fed balance sheet continues to expand. But loan growth remains muted,
up 1% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter with the bright spots being AWM and secured lending in CIB.
On to page 2 for more detail on our results. When looking at this quarter's performance, there's a lot of noise in
the year-on-year comparisons, particularly given what happened in March of last year, and so it's important to
remember a few key points here about March of 2020. Effectively, investment banking activity stopped or got
delayed except for investment-grade debt issuance. We recorded $950 million of losses in Credit Adjustments
and Other in CIB as well as a $900 million markdown on our bridge book. And in Credit, we built $6.8 billion of
reserves relative to this quarter's release of $5.2 billion.
So, with that in mind, revenue of $33.1 billion was up $4.1 billion or 14% year-on-year. Net interest income was
down $1.6 billion or 11%, primarily driven by lower rates. Non-interest revenue was up $5.7 billion or 39%. While
this comparison is in part impacted by several of the items I just mentioned, in absolute terms, we saw strong fee
generation across the franchise including in Investment Banking, AWM and Home Lending, as well as a strong
performance in Markets.
Expenses of $18.7 billion were up 12% year-on-year on higher volume- and revenue-related expenses, the
contribution to the foundation that I just mentioned, as well as continued investments. And credit costs were a net
benefit of $4.2 billion driven by reserve releases. And here it's worth noting that charge-offs were down about
$400 million year-on-year or 28% and continue to trend near historical lows.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
Turning to page 3 for more detail on our reserves. We released approximately $5.2 billion of reserves this quarter
as recent economic data has been consistently positive, indicating that the recovery may be accelerating faster
than we would've thought just a few months ago.
Starting with Consumer, in Card, we released $3.5 billion as the employment picture has continued to improve,
the round three stimulus has provided another level of support, and early-stage delinquencies remained very low.
And in Home Lending, we released $625 million primarily driven by continued improvement in HPI expectations,
and to a lesser extent, portfolio run-off. And then in Wholesale, we released approximately $700 million.
While a strong recovery seems in motion, we're also prepared for more adverse outcomes given remaining
uncertainties around the impact of new virus strains and the health of the underlying labor markets. So, for now,
we remain cautious and are still weighted to our downside scenarios. And at about $26 billion were reserved at
approximately $7 billion above the current base case. However, it's worth noting that even in a more normalized
environment, we wouldn't expect to be 100% weighted to the base case as we'll always have some weighting on
alternative scenarios.
Now, moving to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.1%, flat
versus the prior quarter as net growth in retained earnings was offset by lower AOCI and higher RWA. Perhaps
the more interesting ratio right now is SLR which is at 5.5% excluding the temporary relief that just expired.
As we said all along, we were never going to rely on short-term temporary relief as a long-term planning matter,
and this is evidenced by actions we've taken. We've already engaged with our Wholesale deposit clients to
explore solutions and we issued $1.5 billion of preferred stock in the first quarter.
Having said that, it's worth reinforcing a few points here. First, it's important to remember that the SLR is a
leverage-based requirement, not a risk-based requirement. The growth in bank leverage has been driven by
deposits and, therefore, cannot be cured by reducing lending. In fact, the opposite would be true. If we had more
loan growth, it would help because it would absorb excess risk-based capital. The issue is that we've had muted
loan demand to-date, and even if it starts to pick up, it's hard to envision that organic loan growth could keep pace
with further QE. And therefore, we expect this leverage issue to persist for some time.
And finally, when a bank is leverage constrained, this lowers the marginal value of any deposit regardless if it is
wholesale or retail, operational or non-operational, and regulators should consider whether requiring banks to
hold additional capital for further deposit growth is the right outcome. As we told you last quarter, we have levers
to manage SLR and we will. However, raising capital against deposits and/or turning away deposits are unnatural
actions for banks and cannot be good for the system in the long run.
And then just to wrap up on capital, regarding distribution, the limitations were extended another quarter. So,
based on our income, that corresponds to buyback capacity of about $7.4 billion in the second quarter after
paying our $0.90 dividend. Given the preferreds we plan to issue and the work under way around excess client
deposits, while of course this could become more challenging, we believe that we should be able to buyback most
if not all of that capacity.
Now, let's go to our businesses starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 5. CCB reported net
income of $6.7 billion including reserve releases of $4.6 billion. Starting with the key drivers of year-on-year
financial performance, which I'll just note, have generally been consistent over the last few quarters against a
backdrop of strong consumer balance sheets with higher savings rates and investments as well as healthy de-
leveraging.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
Deposit growth was 32% or $240 billion as existing customers' balances remain elevated and we also continue to
acquire new customers. Client investment assets were up 44%, driven by market appreciation and positive net
flows across our advisor and digital channels. Home Lending originations were $39 billion, up 40% in an overall
larger market. And auto loan and lease originations were $11.2 billion, up 35%, with March being the best month
on record.
However, loans were down 7% as outstandings in Card remain lower even as spend is recovering to pre-COVID
levels. This is in addition to the continued run-off of the mortgage portfolio and partially offset by PPP addition.
Mobile users grew 9% to nearly 42 million and the customer migration to digital continued with branch
transactions still down double-digits. In Consumer Banking, approximately 50% of new checking and savings
accounts were opened digitally, and that's up more than 10 percentage points year-on-year.
Notably, we're also seeing a few emerging trends worth covering. Consumer sentiment has returned to more
normalized levels, reflecting increased optimism. We've seen debit and credit card spend return to pre-pandemic
levels, up 9% year-on-year and 14% versus 1Q19 despite T&E remaining significantly lower. That said, we are
seeing strong momentum in T&E with spend up more than 50% in March compared to February, and similar
growth across cxLoyalty and Ultimate Rewards travel bookings.
With higher rates, mortgage lock margins have tightened and refi applications have slowed, but the overall market
is still robust. And on credit, government stimulus and industry forbearance programs have provided confidence
that the bridge is likely going to be long enough and strong enough. Taken together with the pace of the vaccine
rollout, we believe there's some permanence to the loss mitigation. And while 1Q21 Card losses are higher
quarter-on-quarter, we do expect losses to decrease in the second and third quarters.
In summary, revenue of $12.5 billion was down 6% year-on-year driven by deposit margin compression and lower
Card NII on lower balances, largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher Home Lending production revenue.
Expenses of $7.2 billion were down 1% as we self-fund our investments. And credit costs were a net benefit of
$3.6 billion driven by the $4.6 billion of reserve releases I previously mentioned, partially offset by net charge-offs
of $1 billion.
Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion and an ROE
of 27% on record first quarter revenue of $14.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $2.9 billion was up 67%
year-on-year, excluding the impact of the bridge book markdown last year. IB fees of $3 billion were up 57%, and
while we now rank number two largely due to SPAC IPOs, we maintained our global IB wallet share of 9%. The
quarter's performance was an all-time record, driven by the continued momentum in the equity issuance markets
as well as robust activity in M&A and DCM.
In Advisory, we were up 35% benefiting from a surge in announcement activity in the second half of 2020. Debt
underwriting fees were up 17%, driven by leveraged finance activity. And here, we maintained our number one
rank and lead left position. And in Equity underwriting, fees were up more than 200%, primarily driven by IPOs as
clients continued to take advantage of strong market conditions.
Looking forward, the IPO calendar is expected to remain active with M&A momentum likely to continue. And while
the pipeline is higher than it's ever been, the number of flow deals outside of the pipeline both this year and last
year make it difficult to predict the second quarter. So, at this point, I'd say we expect IB fees to be about flat year-
on-year.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
Moving to Markets, total revenue was $9.1 billion, up 25% against a strong prior-year quarter. In January and
February, we saw a robust trading environment and client activity remained elevated with the positive momentum
from the end of 2020 carrying through to the start of the year. In March, our performance started to normalize, but
remained above pre-COVID levels.
Fixed Income was up 15% with outperformance in Securitized Products and Credit supported by active primary
and secondary markets, partially offset by lower revenues in Rates and Currency & Emerging Markets against the
tough compare in March of last year. Equity Markets was up 47% and an all-time record, driven by a favorable
trading environment in Equity Derivatives as well as strong client activity across products.
In terms of outlook, based on recent weeks, we would expect this quarter to be closer to the second quarter of
2019 as 2Q20 was the best quarter on record for our Markets franchise. But, obviously, it's still early.
Wholesale Payments and Securities Services revenues were $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, both down
2% year-on-year, with higher deposit balances more than offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of
$7.1 billion were up 19% year-on-year on higher revenue-related compensation, partially offset by lower legal
expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $331 million, driven by the reserve releases I discussed earlier.
Now, let's go to Commercial Banking on page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.2 billion and an
ROE of 19%. Revenue of $2.4 billion was up 11% year-on-year with higher lending and Investment Banking
revenue in the absence of a prior-year markdown in the bridge book partially offset by lower deposit revenue.
Record gross Investment Banking revenue of $1.1 billion was up 65% with broad-based strength as market
conditions remain favorable.
Expenses of $969 million were down 2%, driven by lower structural expenses. Deposits of $291 billion were up
54% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter as client balances remain elevated. And loans were down 2% year-
on-year and 3% sequentially. C&I loans were down 4% from the prior quarter on lower revolver balances as
clients continue to access capital markets for liquidity, partially offset by additional PPP funding. And CRE loans
were down 1%, with continued low origination volumes in Commercial Term Lending partially offset by increased
affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $118 million, driven by reserve releases, with
net charge-offs of $29 million driven by Oil and Gas.
Now, on to Asset & Wealth Management on page 8. Asset & Wealth Management generated record net income
of $1.2 billion, with pre-tax margin of 40% and ROE of 35%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.1 billion was up 20%
year-on-year as higher management fees, growth in deposit and loan balances as well as investment valuation
gains were partially offset by deposit margin compression.
Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 6%, with higher volume and revenue-related expenses partially offset by lower
structural expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $121 million, primarily due to reserve releases.
For the quarter, record net long-term inflows of $48 billion were, again, positive across all channels, asset classes
and regions, with particular strength in Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $44 billion as banks
encouraged clients to move excess deposits away from them. AUM of $2.8 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8
trillion, up 28% and 32% year-on-year respectively, were driven by higher market levels as well as strong net
inflows. And finally, deposits were up 43% and loans were up 18%, with strength in securities-based lending,
custom lending and mortgages.

Now on to Corporate on page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $580 million. Revenue was a loss of $473
million, down $639 million year-on-year. Net interest income was down nearly $700 million on lower rates as well
as limited deployment opportunities on the back of continued deposit growth. And expenses of $876 million were
up $730 million year-on-year, primarily driven by the contribution to the foundation I mentioned earlier. The results
for the quarter also include a tax benefit related to the impact of the Firm's expected full year tax rate relative to
the level of pre-tax income this quarter.
So, with that, moving to the outlook on page 10. You'll see here that our 2021 NII outlook of around $55 billion
remains in line with our previous guidance, as the benefits of the steepening yield curve are being offset by
customer behavior in Card. It's worth noting that forecasting NII is perhaps more challenging than it's been in a
long time as many of the key inputs, market-implied rates, deposit forecasts, securities reinvestment, and
customer behavior in Card are all quite fluid.
And as a reminder, while customer deleveraging and higher payment rates in Card is a headwind for NII, it's a
tailwind for credit. And we now expect our Card net charge-off rate to be around 250 basis points for the year.
And then on expenses, we increased our guidance to approximately $70 billion, with the largest driver being
higher volume and revenue-related expenses, which, importantly, have offsets in revenue.
So, to wrap up, the year has gotten off to a strong start and a robust economic recovery seems underway. Of
course, there are still risks and uncertainties ahead that we're preparing for as well as specific issues that we're
facing, including the balance sheet dynamics I mentioned, the rate environment, and tough year-on-year
comparisons, among other things. Having said that, the earnings power of the franchise remains evident, and
we'll continue to use our resources to serve our clients, customers and communities.
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Hi, Erika.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Good morning. My first question is for Jamie. Jamie, you noted during a December conference that you
believe that normalized ROTCE for JPMorgan would be about 17%. And investors are wondering, as we think
about JPMorgan perhaps cementing a higher G-SIB surcharge at 4% this year, is 17% still achievable under that
context or constraint?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Go ahead, Jenn.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
So, Erika, I'll start. So, just a couple of things to think about on capital. So, while we ended the year in the 4%
bucket for G-SIB, and it's probably worth mentioning given the continued expansion of the system through the
Fed balance sheet even staying in 4% could become challenging for us, but just a couple of things to keep in
mind there is, we believe that we do have offsets in the Stress Capital Buffer, and we do believe that it's very
possible that we'll see those come through in this round.
Of course, it's dependent upon the Fed models, not our models, but we've talked about things that – actions that
we've taken, sort of mechanical in nature in addition to moving investment securities into held-to-maturity that
should give us some benefit on the SCB. Of course, that's scenario-dependent, but we do expect some benefit
there that could offset.
It's also important to remember that we still are waiting for the Basel III endgame, and the indication from the Fed
is that they will address G-SIB recalibration as part of that. And so, it's quite possible that we see G-SIB
recalibration, but perhaps another constraint that we'll be managing. So, there is a lot that we'll learn over
probably the next year or two. And of course, the higher G-SIB doesn't come into effect until the first quarter of
2023.
So, we do think we have offsets. We're still thinking about 12% as being a target CET1 for us – of course, given
what we know today. But we are still waiting for that Basel III endgame to really understand what we're dealing
with. And at that 12% in a more normalized environment, which wouldn't just be about rates, it would also be
about loan demand, 17% still feels achievable for us.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And thank you for going through some of the leverage constraint now that SLR has been – exemption has
expired. The investors have also been wondering, as we think about your opportunity to continue to facilitate the
economic recovery globally, does the constraint on SLR and the moving pieces on G-SIB change your priorities in
terms of timing or sizing of the $30 billion buyback or inorganic growth opportunities that you've mentioned in the
past?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
I would say, broadly speaking, no, but an important point there on SLR, we obviously – the levers we have are
issuing preferreds. We can retain more common, but we're also working closely with Wholesale clients in a very
selective way as I mentioned, to find alternatives for excess deposits.
So, it is true that common is one of the levers, although I will say that, while it might give us more flexibility, it
comes at a much greater cost. So, at this point, given what we know and what we expect we don't expect that we
would have to retain more common. We think we can manage this through issuing more preferreds and working
closely with our clients to find alternatives. So, I would say, broadly speaking, no.
The G-SIB constraint, as we've been saying for years now, is one that will become increasingly challenging for us.
And now, particularly with the expansion of the system, it's even more challenging than perhaps it was just a few
years ago, but we're managing through that as well.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Hi, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hey. Good morning, Jenn. I wanted to ask about expenses. Obviously, you've raised the outlook by $1 billion a
few times the last couple times you've spoken. I guess, in terms of the increase that you announced today to the
outlook, could you give a little more color on how much of that is volume- and revenue-related as opposed to the
other buckets you talked about in January which were investments and structural?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Sure. Sure. So, the increase from the $69 billion, which was the guidance we gave in the 10-K, is almost entirely
volume and revenue-related. And so there, I'll just make an important point that it's volume and revenue-related.
So, as an example, volumes in CCB, just given the environment, they are very valuable for long-term franchise
revenue growth, but we may not see that revenue growth in the near term. But, as we always say, we don't
manage this place for one quarter or even one year.
So there are expenses associated with volume growth that may not have the revenue growth you would anticipate
over the long run, but it's almost entirely volume and revenue-related. There are a few other things like marketing

expense that, given the strength of the recovery that we expect, we now expect to lean more in on marketing
expense in the second half of the year, so that's part of it as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And I guess the follow-up would be is that necessarily mean that it's more concentrated the increase in the
first quarter because you had such a big quarter? And are there COVID-related costs that you have in your
numbers this year that might come out over time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Obviously, some of it is in the first quarter. But things like further volume-related expenses, like I talked about or
marketing, they're less so in the first quarter. And then what was your other question?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
COVID.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
COVID. Oh, those numbers are lower than they were even last year and included in the outlook, but not material
in the grand scheme of things.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Hi, Glenn.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Hello there. So, if you're right on the economy, which I think a lot of us think you are, we're starting to see the
spend part of the pickup now, as you mentioned, across credit and debit, and some of the T&E. So, my question
is, how do you think about the staging of the lend part? Both consumer and corporate are so flush with all that
liquidity. How do you think about the timing for loan growth? And if I could get a Consumer versus Wholesale
comment, that would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Sure. So, you used the right word which is demand. And it really is all about demand, which, of course, is quite
healthy, particularly as it relates to the consumer when you think about the amount of deleveraging that we've
seen through this process. So, there, we do expect a second half pickup because, as you say, we first have to
see spend recover before we see re-levering on the consumer side. And then it is also true, even for small
business, which is obviously part of CCB; there, demand has been very low given the support that's available
through PPP. And so that will likely pick up in the second half as well.

And then, elsewhere, AWM has been strong throughout, and we see that continuing. And then, on the CIB side,
that's always lumpy and deal dependent. But that's active as well. And we do see, within secured lending,
opportunities there across asset classes. Again, that's a bit more opportunistic. And then, in the Commercial
Bank, given the level of support, the amount of liquidity in the markets as well as the amount of cash on balance
sheets, loan growth there has been muted and probably will be for some time. But, again, that's incredibly healthy,
ultimately, for the recovery. And so, whether we see that pick up later this year or next year remains to be seen,
but it's all for good reasons.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
I appreciate that. Maybe I'll just ask one follow-up on the deposit side. Obviously, deposit growth has been
incredibly strong. So, the two-parter is, what do you think happens on the deposit side as the economy goes down
the path that you've outlined? And what do you do with the deposit money in the meantime? Because I saw loud
and clear Jamie's comments on it's hard to justify the price of U.S. debt. So, what are we doing with all that
liquidity in the meantime?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
So, first of all, I would say that deposits are going to be driven by the Fed balance sheet and, to some extent,
obviously, by bank lending. But given the demand picture there, you can think of it in the near term as all being
driven by Fed balance sheet expansion. And so, we obviously, continue to expect significant deposit growth,
which is why we've been talking about this so much.
And then just in terms of how we deploy it, you will have seen that our cash balances are up quarter-over-quarter.
And there, it's just important to remember that for sure we are being patient in the investment securities portfolio.
That is true. I'll also mention that because of the steepening of the yield curve, we are less short. Banks will drift
long in a sell-off. And so, that has been part of the dynamic as well. But there's short-term cash deployment also.
And so, what we saw there was when repo markets fall below IOER, we're going to hold that short-term cash
deployment in IOER relative to the repo market. So, you'll see that dynamic on our balance sheet as well.

Hey, Jenn. Thanks. Good morning. Just wondered if you could elaborate on that. You mentioned the record
Investment Banking pipeline and flattish year-over-year as a best guess. I was just wondering if you could talk
about the mix dynamics there. Obviously, the first quarter was just ridiculously great in terms of the ECM markets.
And can you just give us a flavor of where you see activity and how much is that underwriting activity potentially
dampening what might be happening on the commercial loan side?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
Well, I'll start with the latter, which is it's absolutely been very, very supportive of corporates and, therefore, it has
a lot to do with what we're seeing in terms of the muted loan demand from corporates. And then, in terms of the
mix, we expect ECM and M&A to continue. But, on DCM, there's a lot of slow activity that doesn't necessarily get
represented in a pipeline because it's high-velocity type activity.
We saw that in the second quarter of last year. We continue to see that now, which is why I said it makes it a little
bit difficult to predict the second quarter. So, while the pipeline is higher than it's ever been, there is still a lot of
high-velocity activity. And so that's why we think the quarter will be flattish year-over-year despite the very high
pipeline.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. No problem, Jenn. So, the second one is just with regards to the comments that you guys have made for a
while about looking at acquisition opportunities. Just wondering how is the interplay between everything you've
talked about already on balance sheet capacity and ongoing deposit growth and limitations on CET1 and SLR
versus how you make potential decisions around usage of capital in an acquisition capacity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. It's a great question. Interestingly, the issue is not that we don't have capital available to make those types
of decisions. The issue is that we have the wrong binding constraint. So, the binding constraint is leverage, not
risk-based. And so, it doesn't change the way we think about acquisitions at all. In fact, acquisitions and/or
increased loan growth would help to kind of normalize the constraints between leverage and risk-based.
And so, we would love to be able to absorb some of our CET1 through acquisitions because, as I said, it sort of
just brings the balance back into focus. The issue is that it's a leverage-based constraint that is the constraint, and
we're in a low rate environment with low loan demand and very strong deposit growth. So, it's the combination of
all those things that makes leverage the binding constraint. But it doesn't change the way we're thinking about
acquisitions.

Betsy L. Graseck Q

Hey, Jenn. Hey. Thanks for the time. Jenn, a question on Card and looking at the net charge-off, you gave us the
full year of 2.50% and I know you've spent a lot of time in Card earlier in your career. So maybe you could give us
some sense on how you're thinking about the "normalization" of that loss content over time.
When I think back to the bankruptcy changes in the 2000's, it took many years for consumers to re-lever. And I'm
wondering, given your background there, could you give us a sense as to what is different this time? And are
there time frames, historically, we should look at for what a normal course, like re-leveraging back to normal of
that Card loss content should be? How do you think about that?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
Sure. I would say, first of all, it's difficult to find a historical comparison that's totally relevant here because I don't
think we've ever seen this amount of support in the system, which came, of course, on top of an already
reasonably healthy consumer. So, it's difficult to find the historical perspective. But I will say the 2.5%, I mean,
pre-COVID, we would have thought that our loss rate in Card this year would have been 3.3%, 3.5%. So, it just
gives you a sense there that tailwind on credit is significant.
And in terms of what it's going to take for consumers to re-lever, we do expect there to be significant economic
activity in the second half. And so that could come quite naturally. But it could come a little bit later given the
amount of deleveraging we've seen. But the fact that we already see spend above pre-COVID levels and,
obviously, we still have restrictions in place, particularly around T&E, on consumers' ability to spend, when that
comes back, we do think that we'll see spend tick even higher. And that will be a point where perhaps we'll start to
see that re-levering. But it is difficult to know. It's a great question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then the follow-up I have, on your comments around the NII guide and the fact that it's hard to forecast,
I got a couple of questions in this morning just on, hey, why do you think it's flat versus prior guide given the curve
has steepened? And also, deposit growth should continue to be up significantly given QEs continuing this full
year. So, is there some spread angle that you're kind of thinking about that keeps you a little bit more muted? Is it
more the loan growth? Maybe you could talk a little bit about those piece parts that you identified.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Sure. I think it's probably all the above, Betsy. But starting with the steepening of the yield curve, so if you look at
the Earnings-at-Risk disclosure, we did see the benefit roughly in line with what that disclosure shows, which is,
since we last guided on NII, we steepened probably 25, 30 basis points. So, that is incorporated in the outlook,
but it is completely offset by the fact that we continue to see consumer behavior in Card in terms of higher
payment rates. And we haven't started to see re-levering, as we were just talking about, even though spend has
recovered. So, Card – the impacts of Card completely offset the steepening of the yield curve.
You also mentioned loan growth which is critically important to realizing the benefits of the steepening yield curve.
And then, I would just mention, we have reflected in our outlook the fact that we have been patient on deploying
further deposit growth into the securities portfolio in terms of duration. And then also, it's probably worth noting
that the marginal benefit of further deposit growth is quite small given the fact that deployment opportunities are
minimal. And so, you can think about them as being something less than 10 basis points because we do have pay
rate above zero. So, it's something less than 10 basis points. So, the marginal deposit growth from here doesn't
add a whole lot – in this environment anyway.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
Hey, Jennifer. My question's for Jamie. And Jamie, your philosophy is to invest through a downturn, and you're
increasing your investments by one-fourth year-over-year. You already said that. But what's your philosophy
about investing through a boom, as you expect over the next three years? If the pie is growing, do your
investments go higher? It looks like that's not the case with the guidance you guys gave.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. So, I think, Mike, the way to really look at it is it isn't affected as much by boom or bust as you think. So, we
isolate opportunities like for – we announced we're going to hire 300 black financial advisors. We're going to do
that whether it's boom or bust. We're building new data centers. We're building new agile. We're going into the
cloud. So, I think it doesn't really change that much over time. I just think you'll probably see our investments go
up over time, not go down, because we have plenty of organic growth opportunities which we want to invest in.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q

And then how much are you spending in climate? Your 66-pages CEO letter could be a third of a book, almost.
But you really pound the table on climate risk and what you guys need to do. How much are you actually
spending? And what's the payback on that spending for shareholders? Or is this really an ESG reputational
benefit you're looking for?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
So, I'll start there, Mike. And then, Jamie, you can chime in. But climate is a long game, obviously, and we're
investing a lot of effort in our ESG initiatives, not only because they have a positive impact on society and
communities, but because they're also important to our clients, customers and our shareholders. So, we don't
exactly think about it that way, Mike. But we've also invested in multiple teams to help clients through the
transition, and we do recognize it's a transition and clients appreciate that.
We've also made the Paris-aligned financing commitment last year. And we're going to release our annual ESG
report next month, so you'll see more there. And then we also committed to finance $200 billion towards climate
action and sustainable development, and we're continuing to grow those efforts as well. And in fact, your
question's quite timely because we're planning to make an ambitious announcement tomorrow about long-term
scaling of our financing efforts here. So, much more detail to come shortly on that.
But, Jamie, I don't know if you want to add anything.

Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Just maybe a question on the bank SLR, which I think was a bit more of a constraint even than the Firmwide SLR.
Just, I guess, two questions related to that. What kind of flexibility do you have to kind of manage the difference
between the two moving assets out of the bank perhaps? And then if you have any updates or thoughts on
potential changes that regulators are discussing to kind of give maybe relief 2.0 in a more permanent sense on
the SLR?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
So, the bank SLR, broadly speaking, it's going to be the same levers. We do have a little bit more flexibility, as
you note, because we can move things, we can inject capital into the bank from the holding company, so it's a
little bit more flexible, but generally speaking, the constraints and the levers are the same.
And then, in terms of changes, we know what you know, and so we look forward to a proposal. The only thing I
can mention is, of course, the difference between the U.S. and Europe on Basel, as it relates to SLR, is there it's
3% plus half of your G-SIB, and so we have a constant 2% buffer, and with that, you get the flexibility in a Basel-
complaint way to exclude deposits at central banks for a period of time. So, it's possible that it could look
something like that, but we don't know.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Can I just point out on SLR, I think there's a little too much focus on this. We run the business. We do a great job
servicing clients over time. We manage 20 or probably – God knows how many different capital liquidity
constraints. We have multiple levers to pull all the time to do that while serving our clients.
If we got to adjust our strategy going forward, so be it. We'll probably be fine. I think the question you should be
asking isn't what it means for us, is what it means for the marketplace. I've already mentioned several times, we
have $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities, which we cannot deploy in a whole bunch of different ways
intermediating in the marketplace, whether it's repo or just financing positions or helping people because of these
constraints. So, the constraints are more of a constraint on the economy than they are on JPMorgan Chase. We
will find a way regardless of any constraints to do things.
The other thing is G-SIFI, SLR, there are all these multiple things. They need to be recalibrated, and I think
people should be asking how would you recalibrate it and do the best job for the United States and the people of
the United States not for JPMorgan. JPMorgan will be fine either way.

Question and I apologize if you addressed this, I had to jump off for a minute here. But can you share with us the
mortgage servicing business, it looked like you had a small loss this quarter similar to the fourth quarter. Can you
tell us some of the metrics that went into why the servicing business recorded a small loss?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Very good. And then the second question has to do with, when we go back to the day one loan loss
reserves established in January 1, 2020 for you and your peers under CECL accounting, if I recall, I think your
loan loss reserves to total loans at the time were approximately 1.87%. Today, they're approximately 2.42%.
I know you guys gave some color on your outlook for what you think credit will look like; you're being a little more
conservative. But can you share with us, what would it take to bring the reserves back down to the day one levels
that we saw in January 1, 2020?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Well, it's very difficult to try to compare today to – just taking our balance sheet today, taking the profile of our
portfolio today and compare it to CECL day-one because we are very far away from that, in fact, in a very healthy
way. So that's very difficult to do.

What I will say is that it is true that things have continued to improve even since we closed our process in the first
quarter. And we obviously expect things to be – we expect the recovery to be robust in the second half of the
year. And so, if we continue to see that, if we continue to see labor markets recover, if we continue to see the
vaccine rollout be successful, we would have future releases from here.
But I would note importantly that the $7 billion that is the distance between our reserve and the base case is just
for context. We will always have weightings on alternative scenarios. And so, all else equal, which there's a lot in
the all else equal bucket. But we would release something less than $7 billion. So, difficult to compare back to
CECL day-one, but there could be further releases ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
One of the negatives of CECL, which I pointed out right from the beginning, is we spend a lot of time on these
calls describing something which is virtually irrelevant for the bank, which is these are multiple scenarios,
hypothetical, probability-based, and obviously, the more volatile the environment, the more volatile these
numbers.
If a base case was $20 billion and we now have something like $30 billion, we're not going to be taking down a lot
of reserves now because you're always – as Jenn said, you're always going to have an extreme adverse case.
Think of it kind of like a CCAR test. And you always have a percentage of reserves up for that, permanently. And
so, hopefully, my view is we should waste a lot less time on CECL. It makes almost no difference to the company
in general.

Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
And then, back on your servicing point, I got the answer. It's updates to the MSR model, so HPI updates, prepay
updates. So, it's less about the operation and more about the MSR model update.

Good morning. I wanted to ask about the CEO letter where there was talk about being open to fintech deals,
which is something you've talked about in the past. But what type of deals would you be interested in? And, I

Jamie Dimon A

So, remember, after paying a steady, careful dividend and stuff like that, you might prefer to invest in our business
organically, including the acquisitions, than buying back stock. We're buying back stock because our cup runneth
over. We have 13.6% capital to advanced risk-weighted assets, and we're earning a tremendous sum of money.
And we really have no option right now.

But I think the door's open to anything that makes sense. So, we've already done InstaMed, which is an electronic
digital payments platform between providers and consumers in healthcare. We did 55ip, which is a tax-efficient
way of managing money. And we're looking at tons of things ourselves. Some we're building ourselves like
Dynamo. Some we're going to partner with other people.
We've got investments in probably 100 different companies at this point that we either partner with or aligned. So,
we're completely open-minded. It could be payments, it could be asset management, it could be adjacencies, it
could be data. It could be anything like that. It cannot be a U.S. bank. So, we're just reminding people – if you've
got great ideas for us, let us know.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And is the mentality in fintech specifically, is it to potentially accelerate from the investments that you would have
done on your own or to add capabilities, or maybe protect what you already have?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Well, it's a little of everything because you see us adding Chase My Plan and Chase My Loan, and obviously,
competing a little bit with Buy Now, Pay Later. You see us doing Chase Offers to compete with people. You see
us doing Zelle payments. And we've got tons of fabulous stuff coming. We did You Invest a couple years ago. It
had a very good quarter. We're adding robo-investing, which is just getting going.
So, we're adding a broad set of capabilities across the full spectrum. And you're going to see a lot more. You're
going to see personalization of apps. And if you go into the payment system, you're going to see global wallets.
You're going to see tons of stuff that's coming. And, like I said, the fintech has done a great job.
I pointed out that they live under different constraints. But they've done a great job getting rid of pain points,
making things automated, digitizing things, using the cloud. It's incumbent upon us to go fast to the cloud. We
already have 150 major AI projects. But my guess is, in five years, it'll be 1,000 AI projects. So, we're going as
fast as we can to do a great job for customers. And obviously, Fintech will be a challenge.
There's a lot of money there; they're very smart people. I want to be clear. We're not wishing regulations on them
like on us. I think that would be bad for America. But we are wishing for a level playing field when it comes around
certain products and certain services. I, for one, think it's grossly unfair that a neobank can have a small checking
account and earn $200 in Durbin fees, and we earn $100. That just isn't right.
And I can go on and on and on about some of the unfair things. But, look, let the regulators do it. I'm not expecting
any change. We will just adjust our strategies accordingly.

Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. I just have a quick question. As we start to look out to forward rates and market kind of
implying Fed moving somewhat in the near term or intermediate term, how are you guys thinking about deposit
betas this cycle? And kind of what's included in your NII sensitivity, both on the consumer and commercial
deposits? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Sure, so...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
So, I think the way to answer that is the betas have gamma, meaning they change over time. And we have our
best guess in the number that Jenn gives you. So, obviously, the beta's going up all the time, and then it levels
off.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
That's right. And so, the betas have gamma. Like, I'd say that you can think of it as being non-linear, meaning the
beta for the first 100 basis points will be lower than the beta for the second and third increments of 100 basis
points. And so, from here, on the retail side specifically, the first 100 basis points will be very valuable because
there is a lower beta associated with it. So that's really where we see the benefit in NII with short rates in an
environment with low loan growth.

Charles Peabody Q

Sorry about that. I had a question about the impact that negative rates at the short end of the yield curve might
have on your entity. Specifically, you touched a little bit on the IOER rate, and the overnight repo rate being
raised. Would that have any impact on your Market-related NII if they had to raise by 5 basis points?
Secondly, if we do get negative rates at the short end, is that incorporated into your $55 billion NII guidance? And
then, thirdly, if we do get negative rates at the short end, does that have any implications for what loan demand
might look like? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Sure. So, I'll just start by saying, while we have seen repo go negative at times, it's been orderly, and so we don't
expect short rates to be negative for any longer period of time. And we certainly haven't seen spikes, which is
something you would worry about more.
I think, with the amount of capacity in the money market complex and the fact that the Feds increased their RRP
facility, now that facility is at zero, so that certainly is supportive of ensuring short rates don't go negative for any
meaningful period of time. They also, obviously, could increase that. And then, for us, I would say not a
meaningful impact because, obviously, we have 10 basis points of IOER as an option for us. But we do trade
around it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
I would just add, the why is far more important than the number. Like NII, obviously, like in trading, it goes in and
out. But all things being equal – no. It just shows up in a different place. But if you go negative NII, because you're
going back into a recession because there's a negative variant, that's a whole different issue than if it's a
temporary timing thing. I would tell you we would expect rates to be moving up over time and we expect a rather
healthy, very strong economy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yes. And what we've seen so far on the short end is not unhealthy or something we're worried about. It's a
dynamic of so much cash chasing the supply.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Hi, Andrew.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Lim Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Hi, Jenn, Jamie. Good morning. So, just circling back to the SLR, despite issuing $1.5 billion preferreds, you still
lost about of 30 basis points on your SLR. I'm just wondering how you think about the ratio two, three quarters out
from now, whether issuing preferreds and having your discussions with wholesale depositors is going to be
enough to put a floor on that SLR at 5.5%, or whether you're going to have to pull harder than that on those levers
or have to pull harder on other levers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah, so the minimum is 5%, so we have some room. Naturally, we will have a buffer above the minimum, as you
always need to when you have binary consequences of going below. So, you can think about some management
buffer above that, but we do still have room at 5.5%. And we do think that we can manage this at this point
through issuing. We'll be in the market again with preferreds as well as the conversations that we've had with
clients. So far, they have not been disruptive. We're hopeful that that remains the case and that we can manage
this.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Lim Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Okay. So, what's your level of comfort for the buffer above the 5%? That was my follow-on. And then just another
question. You gave an update a couple of quarters ago saying that you had a buffer of – or let's say, excess
provisions of about $10 billion versus your base case scenario economic outlook. Obviously, you've released
quite a lot of provisions since then. Can you give an update on what that figure is now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Sure. So, you can think about a buffer on the SLR of, call it, 25 basis points. It is important to note something like
AOCI is something that we have to incorporate into our thinking and the impact of AOCI as that's part of Tier 1
capital, so we need to have a buffer to make sure that we can manage through any noise we might see there. So,
that's why we have a buffer, and 25 basis points is probably a reasonable one to think about.
On reserves, the distance between where we are and the base case, as I said in my prepared remarks, that's now
$7 billion. What's interesting to note is that that was $10 billion. It was then $9 billion, and we've released $8
billion and it's still $7 billion. So, all of the scenarios have been moving, and there's a lot that goes into how we
think about reserves.
We've always just provided that as context for everyone, particularly last year as we were managing through so
much uncertainty in terms of the inputs into our reserves. So, I wouldn't put a lot of weight into that because what I
also said on the $7 billion is that you shouldn't think about that as available for release because we will always
have some weighting on alternative scenarios. And so, even if everything plays out exactly as we expect based
upon where we closed the books for the first quarter, it would be something less than $7 billion.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Hi, Mike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I'm still wrestling with the deposit conundrum. So, I guess your national deposit share is something like 12%,
and over the last year, I think your incremental deposit share gain is 20%. In other words, the industry deposits
are up around $3 trillion, and your deposits are up around $600 billion. So, I'm just wondering how much of that
was due to QE and how much of that is due to organic growth? And maybe you can fill us in because you're
building out the branches in the lower 48 states and you're expanding commercial bankers and trying to build up
all this organic growth at a time when you can't really monetize those deposits. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Sure. So, first of all, as we always say, we're running the place for the long-term, and we don't expect this
challenge to be a long-term challenge. Maybe a short-to-medium-term, but not a long-term. And then I'll just say
that, yes, there was certainly some organic growth, but it is Fed balance sheet and bank lending that create
deposits, and so that's what we are focused on. And we do think, given what we expect here, that we can manage
it. And it certainly isn't going to change the way we think about market expansion or otherwise as that is long-term
franchise value.

Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Hey, Mike, of the $600 billion – and it's really hard to do that. We think we're growing actual share in almost every
business deposit, but $500 billion to $600 billion was the Fed balance sheet. And we're a big wholesale bank and
a big consumer bank, so obviously a big portion in that shows up inside our company. And again, the new
branches are doing great, but they're not going to move the needle quite like the Fed adding $3 trillion of deposits
in the system.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yes, so we'll be in all lower 48 by the end of July. Is that right? Yeah, Reggie is confirming for me. We will be in all
lower 48 by the end of July. We opened about 75 branches in market expansion last year. We got a little bit

....opportunities that it brings across the company, not just in deposits, of course, because it brings incredible
value to the Commercial Bank and to the Private Bank. And so, the business case there, if you will, is not just
about deposits.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Hi, Erika, again.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Apologies for prolonging the call. I just got this question a lot on Bloomberg from investors. Just wanted to re-
ask the first question another way. It seems like we have been waiting for recalibration on the G-SIB for some
time now. On the other hand, clearly, the expansion of your balance sheet comes with additional revenue
generation and market share taking in some opportunities.
And so investors are wondering if we don't get any sort of calibration that's meaningful and that CET1 floor does
have to move up from 12%, what is the sensitivity of the normalized ROTCE outlook, if any at all, if that 12% does
have to move up in 50-basis point increments?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. Piepszak A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Okay. So if the 12% has to move up, Erika, that would obviously have an impact, but there is so much between
here and there and that being a reality that we can't really comment on it because not only – I know we've been
waiting for G-SIB recalibration for a long time, but it has been made very clear that G-SIB recalibration will be part
of the Basel III endgame, which we have also been waiting for, for a very long time.
And so there will be potential offsets that we're unable to manage because we don't know what they are yet. So,
we continue to wait for Basel III endgame. And then, as I said, we do believe we can manage the stress capital
buffer. Again, it's scenario-dependent, but we do believe we can manage that to be closer to 2.5%, which helps
an awful lot in terms of an offset to G-SIB constraints. So, we're thinking about that 12% number until we know
something different.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
And I'll just add, we're going to fight like hell to keep the 12%, and we're pretty sure we can do it. So, I'm not that
worried about it. But I don't know what the confusion is. If it did go up by – if we're earning 20% tangible equity
and our capital goes up by 5% and we get no return on the 5%, our ROE goes to 19%. So, I don't understand the
confusion.
The underlying results are still fabulous and great, and yes, slightly lower returns. But I think it will be temporary.
We will, over time, find strategies and tactics to get returns that are fair to our shareholders. But most importantly
about those returns, we have great business, great branches, great products, great services, good margins, good
service, good ops, good controls, and that's what we really build all the time. And this other stuff is just managing
around capital constraints.
It's a shame that this is – this is not the way to run a railroad anymore. We're spending time on this call on CECL
and SLR, and it's a shame. And it does distract from growing the American economy. I've mentioned over and
over. We have $2.2 trillion deposits, $1 trillion loans, $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities, much of which
cannot be deployed to intermediate or lend. How conservative do you want to get?
