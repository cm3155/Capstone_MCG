Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry,
Jodi, Mark and I will take any questions you have. I'll begin on Slide 3.
In the second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.28. We released $350 million in loan loss reserves
this quarter, supported by our outlook on the economy and continued improvement in credit quality metrics, the
pace of which has been better than expected. Net revenue totaled $5.8 billion in the second quarter. As expected,
net interest income grew in the second quarter while our fee businesses benefited from improving consumer and
business spending trends.
Notably, as of late June, total sales volumes for each of our three payments businesses, credit and debit card,
merchant acquiring and corporate payment systems, were above 2019 levels for the first time since the beginning
of the pandemic. Our expenses were relatively stable compared with the first quarter.
Turning to capital. Our book value per share totaled $31.74 at June 30, which was 4% higher than March 31.
During the quarter, we returned 79% of our earnings to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share
buybacks. Following the results of the Federal Reserve stress test in late June, we announced that management

will recommend that our Board of Directors approve a 9.5% increase in our common dividend in the third quarter
payable on October.
Slide 4 provides key metrics, including a return on tangible common equity of 20.9%. Slide 5 highlights continued
strong trends in digital activity.
Now let me turn the call over to Terry who will provide more detail on the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 6, I'll start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of second
quarter earnings trends. Average loans were stable compared with the first quarter, in line with our expectations.
Strong demand for installment loans drove other retail loan growth, while C&I loans increased 0.9% supported by
strong growth in asset-backed lending, partly offset by continued paydown activity in other C&I categories.
We saw a decline in residential mortgage loans [audio gap] (03:54) increased paydowns. Average credit card loan
balances were stable compared with the first quarter as the payment rates remained high at 38%, reflecting the
significant level of consumer liquidity. However, period-end balances increased 4.5% on a linked-quarter basis as
we saw some pickup in activity toward the end of the quarter.
Turning to slide 7. Average deposits increased 0.7% compared with the first quarter and grew by 6.4% compared
with a year ago, reflecting the significant level of liquidity in the financial system. Our overall deposit mix continues
to be favorable. In the second quarter, our non-interest-bearing deposits grew 5.9%, linked quarter, while time
deposits declined by 8.1%. Time deposits now account for 6% of total deposits compared with 11% a year ago.
Slide 8 shows credit quality trends, which continue to be better than expectations. Our net charge-off ratio totaled
0.25% in the second quarter compared with 0.31% in the first quarter. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans
and other real estate was 0.36% at the end of the second quarter compared with 0.41% at the end of the first
quarter. We released reserves of $350 million this quarter, reflective of better-than-expected credit trends and a
continued constructive outlook on the economy.
Our allowance for credit losses as of June 30 totaled $6.6 billion or 2.23% of loans. The allowance level reflected
our best estimate of the impact of improving economic growth and changing credit quality within the portfolios.
Slide 9 provides an earnings summary. In the second quarter of 2021, we earned $1.28 per diluted share. These
results include the reserve release of $350 million.
Slide 10. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.2 billion increased 2.4% compared with the
first quarter, primarily driven by higher yields and volumes in our investment securities portfolio and favorable
earning asset and funding mix shifts, partly offset by lower loan yields.
Our net interest margin increased 3 basis points to 2.53%. The impact of lower loan yields was more than offset
by a favorable mix shift in both our investment portfolio and funding composition as well as lower premium
amortization expense.
Slide 11 highlights trends in non-interest income. Compared with a year ago, non-interest income was relatively
stable as the expected decline in mortgage banking revenue and commercial product revenue was offset by
4

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
higher payments revenue, trust and investment management revenue, treasury management fees and deposit
service charges.
On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income increased 10.0% driven by higher business and consumer
spending activity, reflecting broad-based reopenings of local economies. Both year-over-year and linked quarter
mortgage banking revenues were negatively impacted by slowing refinancing activity and reduced gain-on-sale
margins. Linked quarter mortgage revenue growth of 15.7% was primarily driven by the favorable linked quarter
impact of a change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activities.
Slide 12 provides information on our payment services business. In the second quarter, total payments revenues
increased 39.5% versus a year ago and was higher by 16.4% compared with the first quarter. Each of our three
payments businesses saw strong revenue growth on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis, reflective
of the strengthening economy and the increased spend activity. Credit and debit card revenue increased 39.4%
on a year-over-year basis driven by stronger credit card sales volumes and higher prepaid card processing
activities related to government stimulus programs.
Sales volume trends, which are the primary driver of payments revenues, are encouraging. The bottom charts on
slide 12 indicate that as of the end of June, total sales volumes across each of the three payments businesses
exceeded comparable 2019 levels. Certain pandemic-impacted spend categories continued to lag, in particular
corporate T&E. However, consumer travel and hospitality spend volumes are rebounding faster than we
expected, and the pace of improvement in recent weeks has accelerated a bit.
Turning to slide 13, non-interest expenses was relatively stable on a linked quarter basis as expected.
Slide 14 highlights our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at June 30 was 9.9% compared
with our target CET1 ratio of 8.5%. Given improving economic conditions in the second quarter, we bought back
$886 million of common stock as part of our previously announced $3.0 billion repurchase program.
I'll provide some forward-looking guidance. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect fully taxable equivalent net
interest income to be relatively stable compared to the second quarter. We expect total payments revenues to be
relatively stable compared to the second quarter but will continue to track favorably on a year-over-year basis.
While we expect sales volumes growth in each of our three payments businesses to continue to improve
sequentially, prepaid card volumes are expected to decline toward pre-pandemic levels as the impact of
government stimulus dissipates.
We expect noninterest expenses to be relatively stable compared to the second quarter. Credit quality remains
strong. Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than normal. For the full
year of 2021, we currently expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 22%.
I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Terry. Our second quarter results came in as expected and there are many reasons we are optimistic as
we head into the second half of the year. The economy continues to recover towards pre-pandemic activity levels,
and the consumer and business spending activity continues to improve. Credit quality trends have been a positive

surprise. And our payments volumes have come back a bit faster than we expected as recently as a few months
ago.
We are well positioned for the cyclical recovery that we expect to play out over the next several quarters. More
importantly, we are well-positioned to deliver on superior growth and industry-leading returns on equity over the
next several quarters given our business mix, our comprehensive and holistic payments and banking capabilities,
and our expansive distribution model supported by world-class digital capabilities.
I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication throughout the year. We will now open up the
call to Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.

Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Betsy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. I just wanted to dig in a little bit to the guidance and some of the discussion there around the payments
business. I think you mentioned that payments came in a little faster than expected. I know you were expecting
that the payments revenues would accelerate in 2Q. So it came in a little faster than you're expecting, but then I
think you're mentioning that you've got it flat – expecting it to be flat Q-on-Q, but I just want to dig into that. Is that
because the acceleration rate you think is slowing down here, or are you being conservative with the guide for
3Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think it's a combination of things, Betsy. And maybe just if I kind of talk a little bit about payments again,
overall, I think three things to kind of keep in mind in terms of the payments businesses in total. And that is the
sales volume momentum continues to be very strong, especially when you exclude the airline and T&E sort of
activities.
Airlines and T&E continue to be lagging but are getting stronger. In fact, if you listen to any of the airline sort of
quarterly results, the leisure travel is really back to pre-pandemic levels, and business travel is starting to pick up
6


U.S. Bancorp
(USB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
pretty nicely. The other thing I would just say is that corporate T&E continues to be the one area that is still down
quite a bit, but it is improving a little bit faster than maybe what we had expected.
The one area I would just say or highlight is – let me talk a little bit about maybe the three components. If we first
take a look at credit and debit card revenue, again, sales volumes are particularly strong in that area. As an
example, credit sales in the second quarter, we would expect it to continue maybe a slightly lower rate, but credit
sales are about 20% when you exclude travel and entertainment. Debit card sales are about 27%. So the second
quarter was particularly strong and we expect that type of momentum to continue.
The one thing that I would say, though, is that third quarter of last year was the peak with respect to prepaid card
processing revenue. And that has been slowly normalizing, but we really kind of expect third quarter to be back
closer to what would be a normal level. The second thing that is going to end up impacting credit and debit card
revenue for the third quarter is that we are taking the opportunity to invest in growth. So we're giving up some
near-term growth opportunity in order to be able to generate customer account acquisition.
The other thing that I would just mention maybe from a prepaid card perspective, on a normal basis, it represents
about 10% to 11% of that overall credit and debit card revenue category. And it's that factor of it normalizing plus
the investment that's really going to cause the overall payment revenues to be fairly stable relative to the second
quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So even though you've got T&E that is ramping, the prepaid is really offsetting that as you go into 3Q, that's
really the conclusion?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. That's right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right, got it. And then, maybe you could talk a little bit about the credit box and how you're thinking about that
with regard to not only the card space, but the overall loan book.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, I think we've mentioned this last quarter, but we're now back to, fundamentally, the credit box that we
had on a pre-pandemic level, really, across all the product categories.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And your C&I was good, especially if I consider the PPP. So, just wondering what's going on there to generate the
strength that you saw in the quarter.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Yeah, it's a couple of different things. We mentioned that asset-backed securitization lending has been strong and
it's been continuing to improve. I think that's one of the things that we are seeing in that particular category. The
one thing, though, that we're continuing to watch is that the payoffs – or paydowns continue to occur. And that's
simply because of the rate environment. The capital markets activities continue to be fairly strong. And I also think
it's going to take a little bit of time for C&I to develop, simply because of the amount of liquidity that customers
have and are continuing to generate.

Operator: Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Morning, Matt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So good to see costs flat linked quarter, even though you had the beat in fees and you guided to kind of similar in
the third quarter. But I asked last quarter, as the fees pick up, hopefully driven by payments and if rates rise and
loan growth picks up, can you get outsized operating leverage. And last quarter, you thought you could and that
was the plan, the hope. I know you don't give kind of formal guidance beyond one quarter out but, thematically, is
that still the case that while there's investments to make, you would hope for outsized operating leverage as the
revenues pick up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean we certainly have that expectation. I mean, we've made some very nice investments across many
different categories within our business, whether it's in the mortgage business, we see the benefit, especially as
that starts to shift away from refinancing toward the purchase mortgage. Our digital capabilities there will be very
beneficial. I think that we continue to see strong growth with respect to auto end-of-term gains. The payments
businesses where we've made investments, for example, in treasury management sort of capabilities and things
like that, that is starting to pay off.
So, the answer is yes, I think we feel very confident that the investments that we have been making are going to
allow us to generate some nice fee growth as we think about the future.

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
And Matt, we're going to continue to manage expenses relatively stable with the headwinds we have in revenue,
like you talked about, the flat yield curve and margin and loan growth being a little bit challenged. But we'll
manage flat in this environment and then positive operating leverage in a more normal revenue environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then just separately, you recently announced a deal to acquire part of this PFM. Maybe just what is
that exactly? How does it fit into USB? And I had to remind myself, I think you had owned an asset management
company that you sold about 10 years ago, FAF. So, is this kind of a get back into a certain business that you
exited or a different part of the investment in wealth management segment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Matt. So, like you referenced, a few years ago, we did sell, but that was equities and bond business. We
continue to retain the money market business and, in fact, have about $161 billion of assets under management.
And so, this essentially doubles that base with a particular focus on government, which is the space around
government investment pools. And it fits very nicely into our government banking business, our treasury
management and particularly our corporate trust business. So, it's a nice add-on to a business we're already in
that gives us additional scale and customer acquisition.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning. Good morning. Back on the payment side, just as we continue to see the rebound, that you're
flagging, play out. I guess, can you help us think about how you view the long-term growth potential, the business,
perhaps beyond this year? What is a reasonable growth rate to expect out of the various payments business?
And then separately, are you viewing competition in the space any differently today than a couple of years ago? It
certainly seems like it's intensifying. So how do you view that as a dynamic as well? Thanks.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So let me just talk about maybe how we think about it on a longer-term basis. Certainly, when we think
about the payments businesses, we believe that mid-single digits is a good target for us to be able to achieve in
that particular space. We have been making some, as I said, some really nice investments.
The tech-led fees, for example, within Elavon, our merchant acquiring space, today represent about 28% of the
overall Elavon revenue or merchant acquiring revenue. And it's growing at about that pace as well. So it's a nice
business investment that we've made and tech-led will contribute to the overall investment as we go.
And then, I do think that our investments in the RPS digital account acquisition and our treasury management
space, and all those different types of investments on the B2B real-time payments are going to have a real
opportunity for growth.
In treasury management, as an example, about half of that revenue today represents what I would call digital or
forward-leaning type of revenue products, as opposed to legacy products. And they grow at about a 10% to 11%
clip. So I think that there's some real opportunity for mid-single digits or in that ballpark anyway. Andy?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I agree, Terry. And I think in addition to what you said, which is sort of the current case, I would point to our focus
on business banking and this weaving together of the banking and payments capabilities into a comprehensive
product set. And as a reminder, we have just over 1 million business banking customers with less than a 40%
penetration. I think it presents a lot of opportunity. And we've talked about the fact that we expect to grow that
revenue base 25% to 30% over the next few years. So I think that's an additional opportunity in addition to what
Terry talked about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Yeah, right. Great. Thanks, that's helpful. Then separately on the capital front, the CET ratio at 9.9%, your internal
target still sits at 8.5%. And how should we think about migration down towards that level in terms of timing? What
type of factors are influencing the pace that you migrate back towards that target? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, great question. And currently, I think we have capacity under our buyback program. It's about a $3 billion
program. And we have purchased about half of that, thus far. So we'll continue to purchase under that buyback
program. And then, we certainly have the opportunity to be able to expand that or replace it in the future.
We think about deploying or utilizing capital kind of along the various priorities, organic growth being, really, the
top priority and the dividend, as Andy talked about earlier. Then we look at inorganic sort of opportunities to the
extent that they might present themselves or product sort of capabilities and then the buyback program. So that's
kind of how we end up prioritizing it.
From a timing standpoint, I think we're going to continue to watch both from an economic standpoint, but we're
just going to be opportunistic in the market when it makes sense to be buying back shares.

Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.

Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Sure
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I was hoping to sort of revisit this notion of the sort of competitive positioning in payments. I think one of the big
things that I hear on USB is that the payments business is just such a wonderful differentiator vis-à-vis other
banks, but sort of the volume trends versus some of your fintech competitors aren't as striking. Now a lot of them
are much newer companies and stuff like that, so it makes sense. But would just be curious to hear your thoughts
on sort of competitive positioning overall and where you think you're doing especially well but might need some
work, conversely, as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So Scott, this is Andy. As Terry talked about the investments we're making on the digital front and the capabilities
around software and tech-led and I think that has really put us in a great spot. But I think even more important is
this weaving together, like I referenced earlier, the banking and the payments into a comprehensive product set to
help these companies run their businesses.
So that banking payments combination, I think, is particularly important. And the fact that we have strong banking
capabilities and strong payments capabilities is I think how we're going to differentiate ourselves. And it's on two
fronts. One is to extend the current capabilities to current customers, but more importantly, to achieve customer
acquisition at a higher growth rate. So that's where we're focused on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe separately, Terry, you talked about maybe the degree to
which you're seeing sort of institutional deposit inflows related, if at all, to like the largest banks may be turning
them away given their own sort of thresholds [indiscernible] (25:33). And so what's the way you're thinking about
the potential for sort of kind of customer acquisition on the deposit side there in the institutional area, but
particularly when there's not necessarily a ton of robust loan growth to immediately kind of utilize those funds
with?

Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. A great question. It's a little hard to know exactly what the implications are of other actions that it has on us.
But maybe when I end up looking at where our growth is occurring, the strongest growth is really coming from our
consumer and business banking segment rather than on the institutional side. The institutional has actually
probably been staying relatively flat or even coming down based upon rates that are being offered, et cetera. But
the strong growth is really on the consumer side, and we think that that's because of our digital capabilities and
customer acquisition sort of strategies and then the liquidity that customers have.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Hey, good morning, Andy and Terry. I wanted to follow-up on the comments you just made and ask maybe a little
bit more specifically, if you could sort of juxtapose for us the growth outlooks in consumer and commercial and
talk a little bit about maybe where you see the greater potential for inflection, given all the moving parts that we're
seeing around the supply chain dynamics and pent-up demand and all the liquidity and all of that. Would love to
hear your thoughts as you kind of look at those businesses next to each other.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So Bill, the opportunity on the consumer side, I think, continues to be the economic recovery that's
occurring and the strength in payments. And Terry talked about the trends across all three of the payments
categories, particularly card spend and even things like travel and entertainment, while still lower or weaker than
pre-pandemic levels, coming back strong and rapidly. So that's a positive.
And then we have sort of the secular trend that I talked about which was in the business banking side, which is
this combination of payments and business. And so those – the economic recovery on the consumer side and the
secular focus on the business side would be the two areas I would emphasize.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Got it. Thank you. And then I was hoping that you could give your thoughts on the open banking aspect of Biden,
the executive order, making it easier and cheaper to switch banks by requiring banks to allow customers to take
their financial transaction data with them to a competitor. Just curious if you had any broad, high-level thoughts on
that.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. One of the reasons we're investing in all these digital capabilities is because we want to be the very best in
terms of digital and have great capabilities to serve our customers. And that combined with the human element –
finance is complicated and having people in addition to digital, I think, is critically important. So that's how we think
we're going to effectively compete in the long run, and that's what we're focused on.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Got it. And if I could squeeze in one last one. Is there any concern around the child tax credits? And I guess you
talked about the improving – payments revenues are sort of stable but improving and like there's been this whole
dynamic with payment rates being elevated but hope that they get better. Do the child tax credits sort of extend
the recovery, push it further out? Or maybe any thoughts on how you guys are viewing that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think maybe one of the ways to think about it is, the child tax credit, they typically end up getting a great
big lump sum. And now when you spread it out kind of on a quarterly basis or more throughout the year, I think it
just gives people the opportunity to be able to utilize that maybe a little bit more effectively in terms of paying their
lifestyle sort of bills. So I don't think – I don't – it might change in terms of timing as much as anything, but I don't
think it's necessarily a major driver. Andy, do you have a different perspective?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I agree, Terry. We actually – we've talked about the payment rate being a high 30% to 38% in the second quarter,
but it's also stabilized. It was growing for a number of quarters, which has put pressure, obviously, on the card
balances. But stabilization on that payment rate, combined with the increased spend, I think will perhaps lead to
growth in the next few quarters on the card side.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Hey, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi, good morning. Terry, was wondering if you could unpack a little bit the outlook for next quarter NII. Just kind of
thoughts on puts and takes on margin versus volume as you look at the stable outlook for net interest income.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean a big part of that is just what rates have done. But let me kind of step back. I mean we had a really
nice quarter in terms of the growth. That was driven in part by the investment portfolio growth that we had in the
second quarter. We were opportunistic in investing when the 10-year was kind of in that 1.75% range and we put
some cash to work at that particular point in time. We also saw some benefit associated with the premium
amortization expense being a little bit lower.
When we think about the second – or the next quarter, I think maybe the puts and takes are going to be we
expect loan growth to be relatively flat but modestly stronger than what we saw on a linked quarter basis in the
second quarter. Our expectation is that the long end of the curve comes up a little bit, but is – not much. And then
I think that the margin is relatively stable. So, I think when we end up looking at the various components of it,
that's kind of how we think about it.
Loan growth, we are seeing it in that asset-backed securitization lending. We do expect consumer lending to get a
little bit stronger because of the consumer spend activities that are taking place. Andy talked about the payments
rates have kind of hit, we think, a high in the credit card space. We saw some nice growth right at the end of the
June timeframe.
And while they'll continue to be at elevated levels, I think that the fact they're not increasing and maybe coming
down a little bit will help credit card balances as well. And then maybe when we also think about loan growth, auto
lending continues to be very strong. And I think it's really kind of a combination of all those different types of
things.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And not sure if you touched on it yet, but any thoughts on the outlook for mortgage banking volumes and
revenues in the near term, Terry?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Mortgage banking, obviously, it hit its high in the second quarter of last year. And then it's been coming
down simply because the refinancing activities have been slowing over time. When we think about the mortgage
banking business, it has been influenced by that refinancing. But today, the mix of purchase versus refinancing is
about 60% purchase, 40% refinance.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Mortgage banking revenues are kind of back to what I would call pre-pandemic, sort of, level that we saw in the
fourth quarter of 2019, first quarter of 2020, kind of in that ballpark. So I actually think that mortgage banking is
kind of back to that pre-pandemic level. And the investments that we've made in our digital capabilities, our retail
mortgage business and all those sorts of things will help us compete. We have been taking market share,
especially in the purchase mortgage side of the equation. I think that's all kind of beneficial.

Good morning, Ken.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys. I was wondering if I could follow-up on PFM. And I know details weren't released in the
press release, but can you help us think about just what the type of contribution it might bring to revenues, pre-tax
income, earnings, et cetera and use of capital?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Again, we haven't necessarily disclosed all of that. I mean, from a capital usage perspective, it would be
relatively insignificant. I think that one of the benefits maybe of acquiring at this particular point in time is that if we
do start to see rising rates, the benefit of recapturing some of the fee waivers that that business has been
experiencing, and that's all upside to how we were thinking about the business when we ended up acquiring it.
So again, a nice acquisition for us because it gets us into that local government investment pool market, we will
have a number one market share in that particular space. But overall, from a company perspective, it's just
complementary to the money market asset management business that we have.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
And on that point, Terry, do you know what your second quarter fee waivers were in the core trust and investment
management business and how much that might have changed sequentially and should it improve?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
$73 million was Q2, up a little bit from Q1, and I think $73 million is going to be the peak.

Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Right. Okay. Last one. You mentioned in the press release that the first quarter NII – second quarter NII was
helped by higher loan fees. I'm just wondering, how much was that of a helper and also, if you have any color on
what the delta in just PPP loans was as you exited the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, I mean the delta first to second quarter wasn't significant. And when we think about second to third quarter,
we don't think that that is going to be significant in terms of, for example, fee recognition.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
For PPP specifically?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

For PPP specifically, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q

Okay. And were loan fees meaningful in the second quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Not really. I mean – no. I mean any time you have recoveries, you have a little bit of a benefit associated with that,
but nothing of significance.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
The loan growth for your auto portfolio has been pretty strong. I just wondered if you can provide some color on
the split between growth in making loans to – new vehicles versus used vehicles.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Most of our activity is from our dealer finance business and it's mostly new activity. There is some used in there,
but I would say majority's new.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Got it. Okay. And then as it relates to the mortgage banking, do you have the dollar amount of the
favorable impact from the MSR valuation adjustment in the second quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, I'm trying to remember. In the first quarter, I think the net impact was about $140 million, kind of in that
ballpark. So, that would be kind of the benefit that we end up seeing. The first quarter it was $120 million and it
was – it's probably about $100 million of differential.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, I think that's right, Terry. It's about $120 million in the first quarter, negative, and about $28 million in the
second quarter [ph] I guess (37:39)

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Hi, Andy. Hi, Terry. A couple of questions. First one, you mentioned you'd be giving up some near-term growth in
the card side due to investments. Can you talk a little bit about what investments and for how long and why that
would slow down your card growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Well, anytime you're going through both a customer account acquisition as well as the volumes are
expanding, et cetera, your rebates, residuals, your card acquisition costs, all those sorts of things are part of that
revenue line. And so the extent that that is ramping up, it's going to moderate the quarter-over-quarter sort of
growth.
I mean, Vivek, we're always constantly sort of investing in that business. It's just kind of relative from one quarter
to the next how much were investing at any particular point in time. We just think that given the strong sales
momentum and the opportunity at this particular point in time to make those investments, we just think it's the
right thing to do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And then that would hurt third quarter, but then that should, from a comparison standpoint, not be a drag or flip
the other way in the fourth quarter. Is that how we should think about that, Terry, from a timing standpoint as we
model out quarter-to-quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I don't think that the amount of the drag increases in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, but that's
right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Different topic. You said lower MBS premium amortization helped a little in the second quarter. Any color
on what it was or how we can compare where you are versus pre-pandemic, so how much more room for that to
come down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean I would expect that the reduction in premium amortization in third quarter will be kind of similar to
what we saw in the second quarter. And the margin impact over time, as it was going up, was somewhere
between 2 and 4 basis points kind of on a linked quarter basis. So, I think that you could kind of expect that same
sort of benefit in, for example, the third quarter. It starts to dissipate or moderate as we kind of get out into late
fourth and into 2022.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Mike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Your tech spend is up 20% year-over-year, if you look at the year-to-date numbers. So the question is how
much do you think you'll spend this year, what percent increase do you expect, what are you spending it on? And
any more meat on the bones you can give on combining the banking and payment businesses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So maybe from an overall tech spend, we talked about the fact that we make investment of about $2.5
billion in technology broadly. About half of that is capital expenditure. About half of that is what I would call kind of
run rate, if you will. We have been running at that level for some period of time. And the increase that you're
seeing, Mike, is really, as you're making those investments, it takes a little bit of a time for it to kind of get into the
run rate, if you will.
I would expect that – we don't anticipate when we think about, going forward that, that that tech spend amount will
change a lot. What we end up focusing on, I think, has been changing over time. For example, if I were to step
back three, four years ago, it was less offense, more defense. And today, it's probably 60%, 65% offense related
around our digital initiatives, tech stack modernization, those sorts of things as opposed to having to play defense.
So, I think the shift is good because it's more forward-leaning and more revenue-generating sort of activities as
opposed to defense. And I think key – go ahead, I'm sorry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So run the bank, change the bank, you'd say, now, change the bank is like 60% versus 40% run the bank?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think that's a good way of describing it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, you guys – I ask this question every quarter, and you seem to be playing it very close to the vest.
You clearly have been investing a lot in combining the payments and the banking businesses to give – I think you
said on one call, to be more Chime-like or go after Chime, not them specifically but the concept. Can you give us
any more meat on the bones as far as what the strategy is, when we're going to see it? You said you want to

serve existing clients better but also capture a lot more new customers. And I don't know where to look for that in
the external releases or when we should look for it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A

something in the earnings release and deck by the end of the year to give you more information on this. We are
looking at it on a regular basis. It's one of our top priorities. I think it's a huge opportunity both from an increased
penetration to current customers as well as customer acquisition, and we'll give you more on this before the end

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Terry, you touched on in your opening comments about loan growth. And you mentioned about the C&I growth
increased slightly driven by asset-backed type of lending, but it was partially offset by the continued paydown
activity in other C&I categories. The question is on the pay down activity.
We know that many of the commercial borrowers have elevated liquidity levels, which may be contributing to this.
But can you maybe further elaborate on what your customers are telling you? Is it the supply chain problem where
they just – like your auto dealers, for example, just don't have the inventory, therefore, they have this extra cash
flow and they're able to pay down? And would this then change as the supply chain issues for all companies, not
just auto, starts to get ironed out in the next 6 to 12 months, which could lead to maybe an accelerated
commercial loan demand?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean I do think that commercial loan demand will start to pick up. I think it's just – it's a matter of timing
when does that actually occur. And I do think that they have to get through that excess liquidity, or at least some
of it. And they also – I think that they need to start making those capital expenditures. And we're starting to see
that.
I mean when we talk across our markets, I think that the, for example, middle-market customers are certainly
much more optimistic today than they were even a quarter or two quarters ago. And that usually translates into
making longer term sort of business investments. And so, I think that we'll continue to kind of see that. I do think
21


U.S. Bancorp
(USB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
that we're – I do think that supply chain is impacting it to some extent, but I think that that's more transitory. I think
that that will dissipate over time in terms of the impact.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Terry, I agree. And the only other key factor, I think, is many companies are awash in liquidity. They have strong
balance sheets. They've been becoming more efficient and their balance sheets are strong, which was reflected
in our deposits on the right side of the balance sheet. So I think that's another factor.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And just as a follow-up on this commercial customer discussions that you've been having with these customers.
What's their view about inflation? Are they concerned that they're not going to be able to pass on higher prices to
their customers? Or any color that you guys are picking up in your discussions with these customers about the
outlook for inflation and what it means to them?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think, Gerard, a number of our manufacturing companies in particular are passing on some of the
increased supply costs that they're recognizing. And it is a factor in their pricing as well. So I do think some of it is
being passed on – a lot of it's being passed on. And I think this question around how transitory this is, is one that
is often debated. But I can tell you right now, it's impactful. How long it lasts, I'm not sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then just as a follow-up. Andy, you touched about the liquidity helping on the deposit side. We
also all understand what quantitative easing has done to the deposits of the banking system. Do you think that
when tapering takes place probably end of the year, let's say, that there may be some pressure on deposit growth
for you folks or that you really haven't been impacted that materially by the quantitative easing by the Fed
because that's more wholesale-oriented, and maybe [ph] in part hitting the money centered (48:17) banks maybe
more so than you folks?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So I think, we, U.S. Bank and we, the industry, have certainly benefited from a deposit growth standpoint because
of the Fed balance sheet. I don't think there's any dispute around that. I do think as that starts to diminish, you'll
see some impact on deposits. But I also would point out that some deposits have also – or some funds have also
moved off-balance sheet to money market funds. This is, again, this mix we have and this opportunity to go either
on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet. So, some might migrate more to the on-balance sheet component in that
environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Very good. Thank you.

Operator: Your next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Just a follow-up, a big-picture question, Andy. You've had six years of negative operating leverage, and we all
know the reasons for that, from the regulatory to the investing to the pandemic and everything else. And I guess,
technically, year-over-year, still a little negative. But quarter-over-quarter, this is some of the best positive
operating leverage you've had in a while and it seems like, it's not going negative ahead, it seems.
So are you willing to call a turn in that six years of negative operating leverage, or is it too early, or is that kind of a
next year event? I know I'm getting ahead of where you maybe want to go, but it's been a long wait for the
revenues growing faster than expenses. It seems like you might be there, but I'm not sure.

Yeah, Mike. So I think like I mentioned before, we're going to manage expenses flat in this challenging revenue
environment. And the challenging revenue environment's a function of the things we've talked about, which is this
lower-than-normal loan growth, this flat and low yield curve, and the function of still returning to normalization on
things like travel and entertainment and so forth. So flat until we get normal and then positive operating leverage
when we start to get to a more normalized revenue environment, that's how we're managing the company.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to ask one follow-up. You guys have historically been very deliberate
about your use of M&A to create value. As you look ahead, is there an opportunity to think differently, for
example, by taking the strength of your existing franchise to expand into new markets and win customers without
having to acquire legacy branch infrastructure? Or is sort of bank M&A likely to look the same as it has
traditionally? Any thoughts around that topic would be helpful.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Yeah, Bill. So we talked about the factors. There's a few ways that we continue to grow and expand from a
consumer and retail and business standpoint. One is continued acquisition with our core organic initiatives around
digital acquisition and focusing on that, which we're making great progress on. The second is this concept of
digital-first, branch-lite expansion like we were doing in Charlotte, North Carolina, where we have fewer branches
and really leveraging data and digital capabilities.
The third is partnerships like what we've done with State Farm, 19,000 agents who are really working to refer our
card and deposit products. It's just an extension nationwide of our capabilities. And the fourth would be more
traditional M&A, and we look at all those opportunities depending upon what's in front of us.
