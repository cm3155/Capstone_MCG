Good morning and thank you for joining the call. I hope that you and your loved ones are well. We generated
$168 million in earnings in the third quarter, notwithstanding the uncertain economic environment. These results
reflect the rebound in economic activity experienced during the period due to further opening of the economy and

the unprecedented level of federal stimulus. Our strong results also reflect our diversified sources of revenue and
prudent risk management.
Please turn to slide 3 for an update on the current business environment in Puerto Rico. Following a strict
lockdown between mid-March and late May that helped curtail the initial spreads of pandemic, many of the
restrictions that were in place were gradually loosened. We have seen a revival in business activity as the
economy reopened. Economic trends and customer activity continue to improve.
Employment trends, which deteriorated rapidly in April, are still down significantly compared to last year, but have
also begun to improve. Total non-farm employment has increased by 7% since April, but remains 8% below
September 2019 level. New auto sales have rebounded sharply and in the third quarter were up 18% year-over-
year. While demand for automobiles remains strong, lack of inventory may impact sales going forward. Cement
sales increased 29% in the third quarter, both sequentially and as compared to the year-ago period.
Debit and credit card sales increased by 32% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and by 27% versus last
year's third quarter. Year-to-date sales were up 7% compared to 2019. Similarly, BPPR's third quarter mortgage
originations have rebounded, increasing by 69% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Tourism is improving slowly, but it continues to lag other areas of the local economy. Hotel occupancy bottomed
in April at 5%. However, as restrictions were lifted, occupancy levels increased to 43% to the end of July. While
airport traffic has been gradually increasing, arrivals during the month of September were still 48% lower than the
previous year.
Please turn to slide 4. We are offering full-banking services at 94% of our branches. As a management team, we
continue to take measures to ensure the soundness of our operations and the safety of our employees and
customers. We are offering alternative work arrangements for a significant portion of our employee base. We
have further strengthened our return-to-work protocol to ensure a safe transition back to on-premise activities
when possible, which we currently plan will be no earlier than January 2021.
During the quarter, we paid a second special bonus to our branch employees in recognition of the unique
challenges they face during this period. We're also focused on supporting our customers in this uncertain
environment. During the initial periods of the pandemic, we offered payment relief to our retail and commercial
customers and continue to work with those clients who still needs help.
With respect to the PPP program, we have deployed an online platform for customers to request loan forgiveness.
86% of the total loans originate are below $50,000, qualifying them for the simplified process. We expect that the
forgiveness process will be substantially completed through the fourth quarter of 2020.
We continue to have more than 1 million monthly active users on our Mi Banco digital platform in Puerto Rico. We
captured 70% of deposits in the third quarter to digital channels. Year-to-date, 66% of our deposits have been
captured digitally compared to 52% in 2019. Finally, and most impressively, given Puerto Rico's recent
demographic trends, our customer base continues to grow increasing by 41,000 in the third quarter to 1.9 million
customers.
Please turn to slide 5. Our quarterly net income of $168 million was $41 million higher than the second quarter
and $3 million higher than the same quarter last year. Third quarter results were driven by higher revenues and
lower provision, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in net interest income was driven by

an increase in our investment portfolio and lower deposit costs. Credit quality trends were solid in the quarter.
However, we remain vigilant as the economic outlook is still uncertain.
In the quarter, we completed a series of bulk mortgage repurchase transactions from our GSE servicing portfolio
totaling $808 million. These transactions, along with a shift of a portion of our short-term investments to agency
mortgage-backed securities, were excluded in order to deploy liquidity to increase interest income and improve
our margins.
Please turn to slide 6. Before turning it over to Carlos, I want to comment on a series of actions to realign our New
York Metro branch network. As part of this realignment, 11 of our lower performing branches in the New York
Metro area will be closed. We anticipate the closure of these locations to be completed by the end of January.
These actions will impact 83 employees who will be receiving severance and transition assistance. We remain
committed to the New York Metro market and will maintain our presence in most of the current communities,
providing [ph] critical (00:07:00) accessibility to financial products and services that our customers rely on. Eight
of the branches we are closing are within 2 miles of another one of our branches. We will continue to operate 27
branches throughout the New York Metro area, our largest retail network in the mainland United States.
This difficult decision was made following a detailed review of our current network including foot traffic, branch
proximity, customer needs, and accessibility of supplemental services. The branch realignment will allow us to
reduce operating expenses, leverage resources to focus on small- and medium-sized businesses, and enhance
our digital offering to support changing customer behaviors. As a result of these actions, we expect to record a
pre-tax charge of approximately $25 million, with $23 million to be reflected in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Going forward, we estimate annual savings will be $13 million, with an expected payback period of approximately
two years. We are confident that are our branch repositioning strategy will strengthen our operations in New York,
as we continue to meet the growing and diverse needs of our customers, employees, and the communities that
we serve.
I will now turn the call over to Carlos.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio. Good morning. Please turn to slide 7. As usual, additional information is provided in the
appendix to the slide deck. Today's earnings press release details variances from the second quarter.
Net interest income for the third quarter was $461 million, an increase of $10 million from the second quarter.
Non-interest income increased by $16.7 million to $128.8 million in Q3, driven by the reinstatement during the
quarter of certain service charges and late fees, which were waived in Q2 as part of our response to the
pandemic.
Deposit service charges were higher by $6.7 million, mainly in Puerto Rico, due to higher transaction volumes.
And other service fees were also higher by $17.8 million, as customer activity increased debit and credit card fees
by $13.4 million. In addition, there was a positive adjustment of $5.3 million to indemnity reserves on previously
sold loans, mainly due to reserve releases related to the mortgage loan repurchases. These items were partially
offset by a lower mortgage banking income by $13.3 million, primarily driven by a negative MSR adjustment and
the impact of the bulk loan repurchases.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2020
While not yet there, we continue to move towards our historical normalized non-interest income run rate of $135
million to $140 million per quarter. In the short term, we may settle at slightly lower quarterly levels, as high
deposit bonds has continued to reduce some deposit-related fees.
Provision expense for the quarter was $19.4 million, which is $44 million lower than in Q2. Lidio will expand later.
Total operating expenses were $361 million, $13 million higher than the prior quarter. As client activity increased
during the quarter, we saw a corresponding increase in associated costs. We had higher volume-related
expenses in two categories, processing and technology by $5.5 million as well as card processing and
interchange by $1.9 million.
Equipment expenses increased by $3.2 million, mainly due to higher amortization expense. We also had an
increase in reserves for operational losses of $4.7 million and a higher provision for unused commitments by $4.4
million. These increases were partially offset by lower audit and tax fees as well as lower write-downs of
foreclosed auto. And personnel cost was decreased by $3.2 million due to lower comp expense, partially offset by
higher production-related commissions and bonuses.
In the first quarter, we announced that, in response to lower interest rates and the effect of the pandemic, we
implemented various cost-saving initiatives. We now expect to exceed the targeted $55 million in savings during
2020 and project our average quarterly expenses for the year to be around $365 million, lower than our prior
guidance of $369 million per quarter and lower than our original expense guidance for the year of $383 million per
quarter. In Q4, we are forecasting operating expenses of approximately $378 million, excluding the costs
associated with the branch actions announced today. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. In Q4, we
expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 22%.
Please turn to slide 8. Before I move to net interest income and margin dynamics, I'd like to discuss in more detail
the bulk mortgage repurchase transactions that were completed in Q3. Delinquencies and deferrals have
increased then population of serviced loans eligible for repurchase. In Q3, we executed $808 million of bulk
mortgage repurchases from our GSE loan servicing portfolios in order to limit future servicing advances and
sundry losses and to increase interest income. These transactions resulted in a net expense of $10.9 million
during the quarter. The impact is reflected in various lines of our income statement as noted in the slide. The most
significant portion of the charge is related to the MSR asset as well as interest payments we had advanced to the
GNMA pools that we do not expect to collect under the FHA guaranty.
These expenses were offset by servicing income for these loans and the release of the indemnity recourse
reserve for the acquired Fannie Mae loans. Based on the net yield of 3.5% for the repurchased assets, we expect
to recover the expense in less than six months through net interest income.
Please turn to slide 9. The net interest income for the quarter was $461 million, an increase of $10 million from
Q2. The three primary drivers of this increase were increased balances in the investment portfolio, primarily
driven by higher levels of deposits in Puerto Rico; income recognized from loans issued under the PPP program
by $10.3 million, $4 million higher than Q2; and lower deposit costs primarily at Popular Bank.
We saw deposit growth of $2.2 billion in the quarter. This increase was once again across all client segments in
Puerto Rico. But in Q3, it was led by retail and commercial deposits, not public deposits. About $700 million of this
increase was related to our bulk mortgage repurchases and left the bank early in the fourth quarter.
NIM decreased by 19 basis points to 3.06% in Q3. On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest margin was 3.37%,
a decrease of 19 basis points. Loan yields and deposit costs dropped by similar amounts, 8 basis points and 7

basis points, respectively. Just like in Q2, the lower NIM is related to asset mix. The increase in average deposits,
which are invested mostly in overnight Fed funds and short-term US treasuries, and higher average balances in
PPP loans of $1.4 billion compared to $913 million in Q2.
For the fourth quarter, NIM will be impacted by the pace at which PPP loans are forgiven and also by additional
changes in our asset mix. The remaining unamortized portion of the fees related to PPP loans is approximately
$41 million.
As of the end of the third quarter, Puerto Rico public deposits were roughly $14.5 billion, about $500 million higher
than in Q2. We continue to expect public deposits to come down over the mid to long term. Under the CARES
Act, for example, assistance funds provided to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico must be used by year-end.
However, the potential for assistance – additional COVID-related federal assistance could increase balances in
the near term.
Our average loan balances increased slightly in the quarter growing by $263 million. This growth was primarily
driven by lower yielding PPP loans, partially offset by lower levels of higher yielding consumer balances at BPPR.
[ph] Ending (00:16:29) balances also increased by a portion of the mortgage repurchases completed at the end of
the quarter.
In Q3, we continue to see strong demand in mortgage and auto loans and leases, while balances in our personal
loan and credit card portfolios continue to show net prepayments. Economic, health, and business uncertainties
make it difficult to predict loan balances for the fourth quarter and onwards. We expect loan balances to move
lower due to PPP forgiveness as well as limited demand fueled by unprecedented levels of clients' liquidity.
Please turn to slide 10. Our capital levels remained strong relative to mainland peers as well as with respect to
well-capitalized regulatory requirements. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in Q3 was 15.9%, up 20 basis points
from Q2. Tangible book value increased by $1.56 per share to $61.69. This increase was driven by our quarterly
net income, offset somewhat by dividend payments.
In this slide, we repeat an update, a calculation of our pro forma capital ratios, applying the loss ratio of our last
published DFAST severely adverse stress test from 2017. In this simulation, we still end up with a very strong
CET1 ratio of 14.7%. This calculation is a point-in-time estimate, not a full-blown stress test. So, it does not
include the nine quarters or future PPNR that is typical on a full stress test. For the third quarter 2020, our
allowance for credit losses represents 52% of this DFAST loss estimate.
Our return on average tangible equity was 14.2%. We will continue to pursue our target of double-digit return on
tangible equity. As discussed last quarter, we expect to engage with our regulators about our capital plan early
next year and continue to target, being able to make capital-related announcement in April of 2021.
With that, I turn the call over to Lidio.

Thank you, Carlos, and good morning. Overall, our credit performance remained stable during the third quarter of
2020 aided by payment deferrals, government stimulus, and the resumption of collection efforts. Given current
uncertainties, we're monitoring the impact of the pandemic on our entire loan portfolio. Yet, certain commercial
segments are more sensitive, are highlighted on slide number 11.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2020
Within the CRE non-retail segment, the exposure in Puerto Rico is mainly comprised of office space, while the
exposure in the US is mainly multi-family. The average original loan-to-value in Puerto Rico is 78%, while in the
US is 72%. Office space and multi-family occupancy and collection have remained stable through the pandemic.
To-date, there have been a moderate number of downgrades in these segments. The utilization deferrals mainly
relates to consumer strategy to strengthen liquidity. Of the customers that have exited relief, 98% of accounts are
current.
In the healthcare facilities segment, our Puerto Rico exposure is mainly to hospitals, while our US exposure is to
skilled nursing facilities. For both regions, federal and local assistance have supported the industry operations.
Today, there have been a limited number of deferral requests and downgrades in this portfolio.
Within non-essential retail, the shelter-in-place orders curtailed activity of this segment. As a result, we have
experienced a significant number of deferrals and downgrades, most within [ph] DFAST-rated (00:20:32)
category. Of the customers that have exited deferrals, 99% of accounts are current. The average original loan-to-
value for this segment is 59%.
In general, based on borrower surveys conducted in the second quarter, occupancy has remained stable
compared to pre-COVID levels. Strip malls reported an 86% occupancy and 83% collection rate, while shopping
centers reported an 86% occupancy and a 64% collection rate. Regarding auto retail in Puerto Rico, this activity
was subject to the lockdown order and sales decreased significantly in the second quarter. Upon the authorization
to resume sales, the segment reported strong sales during the third quarter.
Regarding the construction segment, most of our exposure is in the US and principally in the New York Metro
region. The majority of our projects are in late stage of completion, have low loan-to-cost, and average original
loan-to-value of 75%, and nominal exposure to high-end residential. To-date, there have been a limited number of
deferral requests and downgrades in this portfolio.
During the quarter, inflows of NPLs increased by $31 million driven by two relationships, one in Puerto Rico and
one in New York. Both relationships exhibited difficulties prior to the COVID crisis and the risk profile continue to
deteriorate, which prompted our decision to place them in non-accrual status.
Our hotel exposure is mostly in Puerto Rico. At the end of the quarter, our total exposure stood at $372 million
with an average of original loan-to-value of 69%. This segment has experienced elevated levels of stress due to
limited business and leisure travel. Most of the original deferrals expire in the third quarter. But given the
challenges of the industry, we foresee additional extensions to support our borrowers. During the quarter, we
downgraded $52 million of accounts in this segment after having downgraded $279 million in the second quarter.
Restaurant balances were [ph] $344 million (00:22:55) at quarter end. This segment has experienced stress given
by the shelter-in-place order. The majority of our restaurant borrowers, particularly quick-service or fast food,
continue to operate to delivery and carry-out. In the governor's latest lockdown order, restaurants can operate at
55% capacity. Once the economy fully reopens, we expect this segment to rebound at a faster pace, especially
the quick-service restaurants. Of the customers that have exited deferrals, 98% of accounts are current. To-date,
this segment has had a significant number of deferrals and downgrades most within DFAST category. To finalize,
let me also discuss the segment to which we are not exposed to. We do not have a material credit exposure to
energy, airlines or shared national credits.
Turning to slide number 12, we have provided relief to our customer through loan modification consisting of
deferrals, forbearance or extensions. We granted assistance to approximately 131,000 customer accounts,

representing $8.6 billion of loans and 29% of total balances. 95% of customers have exited relief and
approximately 95% of these accounts remain current. Although encouraged by these trends, most of the
deferrals, which ended in the third quarter, impacted delinquency levels favorably. We remain attentive to
delinquency trends and expect their visibility next quarter.
Please turn to page number 13 to discuss credit metrics. Non-performing assets decreased by $42 million to $839
million, mainly driven by an NPL decrease of $26 million coupled with another decrease of $30 million. The NPL
decrease was driven by reduction of $33 million in Puerto Rico due to lower mortgage by $27 million, [ph] OREO
(00:25:06) by $14 million and commercial by $12 million, offset in part by the $22 million construction NPL inflow
previously mentioned.
In the US, NPLs increased by $7 million, driven by the $9 million construction relationship mentioned earlier. The
OREO decrease was driven by the resumption of sales activity and the suspension of foreclosure activity. At the
end of the quarter, the ratio of NPLs to total loans was 2.5% compared to 2.6% in the previous quarter.
Please turn to slide number 14 to discuss NPL inflows. Compared to the second quarter, NPL inflows, excluding
consumer loans, increased by $6 million, driven by an increase of $19 million in the US due to the previously
mentioned construction loan, coupled with an $11 million relationship that mature and reach 90 days while in the
renewal process. The loan renewal was completed during the quarter, and the loan was returned to accrual status
before the quarter ended. The increase was offset in part by a decrease of $40 million in Puerto Rico, driven by a
decrease of $41 million in mortgage, offset in part by an increase in the commercial, construction inflows of $28
million due to a construction relationship mentioned earlier.
Turning to slide number 15, net charge-off amounted to $17 million or an annualized 24 basis points compared to
$65 million or 92 basis points in the previous quarter. In Puerto Rico, net charge-off decreased by $48 million,
mainly due to lower consumer by $36 million mostly related to auto loans. The government's stimulus, deferrals
granted, and the resumption of collection activity has had a significant impact in the delinquency of our portfolios.
About 70% of our credit clients in Puerto Rico also have deposit relationships at the bank. On average, these
clients have increased their liquidity by 20% since the pandemic began. We do not expect to see changes in net
charge-off onto the first half of next year. Everything else being equal, given the CECL methodology, net charge-
offs are already – are reflected in our reserve and thus, the P&L impact has been accounted for.
The corporation allowance for credit losses increased slightly by $7 million to $926 million, driven mainly by an
increase in the US CRE portfolio. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans held in portfolio remained flat at
3.15% in the third quarter. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to NPLs was 126% compared to 121% in the
prior quarter. The provision for credit losses decreased by $44 million to $19 million due to significantly lower net
charge-offs. The provision to net charge-off ratio was 115% compared to 97% in the previous quarter.
Please turn to slide 16 to discuss the allowance for credit losses. We adopted CECL on January 1, 2020. Since
the adoption, our allowance for credit losses related to loans has increased by $440 million or 92%, driven by the
day one adoption impact, changes to macroeconomic scenarios, and loan portfolio changes. At the end of the
third quarter, the allowance for credit losses increased by $7 million compared to the prior quarter. Variances
were driven by economic outlook, changes to portfolio balances, and portfolio credit quality.
While we used single economic scenarios in Q1 and Q2, given that one economic outlook is inherently uncertain,
we enhanced our process for the third quarter and introduced probability weights of different scenarios in our
estimation. We combined Moody's Analytics September's S1 optimistic, Baseline and S3 pessimistic scenarios.
Probability weights were applied to each scenario output as part of the ACL estimation process. When compared

to the second quarter Baseline scenario, the third quarter Baseline assumes a more favorable increase in
economic activity from the first quarter of 2020 to the second quarter of 2021 with continued growth thereafter.
Among the three scenarios using the ACL, the Baseline scenario is assigned the highest probability followed by
the S3 scenario, given the uncertainties in the economic outlook and downside risk. The S1 scenario is
considered, but carries a lowest weight. The implementation of probability weight and changes in macroeconomic
scenarios caused the ACL to increase by $31 million. This increase was offset in part by the net charge-off activity
and portfolio changes.
To summarize, our loan portfolio attributed stable credit quality metrics during the third quarter, aided by the
payment deferrals, government's stimulus, and the resumption of collection efforts. However, as the effects of the
pandemic continue to evolve and remain fluid, the full extent of the economic disruption is uncertain. We will
continue to carefully monitor the exposure of the portfolios to pandemic-related risk, changes in the economic
outlook, and how delinquencies and net charge-offs evolve over the next few quarters.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks. Thank you.

Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Lidio and Carlos, for your updates. While the economic scenario remains uncertain, we generated
$168 million earnings in the third quarter, reflecting the economic rebound, fueled by the unprecedented level of
federal stimulus. Our strong results also reflect our diversified sources of revenue and our prudent risk
management. Deposits continue to grow and our capital liquidity levels are robust. We are well-positioned to
continue to serve our customers, as they manage through these uncertain times.
This month marks Popular's 127th anniversary. And despite the current challenges, we have much to celebrate.
We are blessed to be part of a team of talented and dedicated colleagues who have met the current challenges
with courage and resilience. We have a loyal customer base that continues to grow, and we are an integral part of
the communities we serve. This commitment was recognized earlier in the month by the American Bankers
Association, which selected us as one of only seven banks nationwide to receive the 2020 Community
Commitment Award for our financial education program. We are very proud of this achievement.
For all these reasons, we look forward to the future with a renewed sense of purpose and optimism. We're now
ready to answer your questions.

Alex Twerdahl from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.

Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
First off, I wanted to circle back to something you said, Lidio, in your prepared remarks. I think you said that you
didn't expect net charge-offs – the level of net charge-offs to change meaningfully into the middle of next year. I
was wondering, one, if I heard that correctly and, two, if based on the loans that are coming off deferral and
collection efforts and things like that, what gives you the confidence that the charge-off levels will remain low and
if we should extrapolate that into progression of the provision over the next couple of quarters as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
I mentioned [indiscernible] (00:33:26) meaningful. I mentioned change. We expect changes to net charge-off in
the first half of next year, everything else being equal. I think we had a significant high level of charge-offs in the
second quarter and significantly low level of charge-offs in the third quarter. So you can try to use those as
guidepost onto the first half of next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then I noticed the mortgage activities – that mortgage activity was pretty strong and seen some reports
recently on high-end real estate in Puerto Rico rebounding pretty meaningfully year-over-year. I was wondering if
you can give us some commentary on what you're seeing in the housing market just in general in Puerto Rico, if it
is rebounding and strong the way we see stateside?

Ignacio Alvarez A

Yes. This is Ignacio. Yes. In general, it is rebounding. I mean, obviously, you've read about the high-end Dorado
and Bahia. I mean, clearly, they're very strong. But we have seen a recovery across many of the different areas
and especially in the metropolitan area. So generally, we're seeing demand up for housing. There hasn't been a

lot of supply, new supply in the recent years. So it is increasing. We've seen it in our operations. The originations
are way up, applications are way up. [ph] We've seen (00:34:47) OREO sales. So we're definitely seeing
improvement in the residential market, especially in the metro area and especially in the middle and higher
income neighborhoods, but really across the board, but I would say mostly the metropolitan area.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
All right. That's helpful. And then just a final question for me. Just, Carlos, as you think about the moving parts in
NII, obviously, the NIM is going to be pretty volatile with PPP forgiveness over the next couple of quarters. But
when I look at your margin and I look at the amount of cash and liquidity on the balance sheet and then I sort of
pair that against some time deposits that still seem like they're paying rates that are much higher than you'd
expect given the rate environment. Does that represent a pretty big opportunity over the next couple of quarters
for the cost of deposits to continue coming lower and providing all the more juice to NII?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, when you look at the margin, actually this quarter was not too different from last quarter. In that,
almost the totality or the vast majority of our reduction in margin was really linked to asset mix as opposed to
rates or anything else.
With respect to deposit costs, we have – just two answers to that question, Alex. When you look at Puerto Rico,
we have interest-bearing deposit costs of 24 basis points, total deposit costs of 18 basis points. That's our best-in-
class. And while there's always room and we will continue to look at opportunities, there is not immense amount
of room to continue to lower deposit costs in Puerto Rico. We have had more room in the States and that's where
a lot of the deposit costs drop happened this quarter. We dropped around 20 basis points in total cost – deposit
costs in the US this quarter. So, we will continue to pursue the effort in the US. So, is there opportunity? Yes. But
the opportunity is larger in our smaller deposit book, which is the one in the States.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just a final question for me. During the quarter, there were some rumors that Evertec was
potentially exploring the sale and that's obviously a pretty big [ph] realized (00:37:11) gain on your balance sheet.
If that were to happen, would that change the ability to return capital for you guys in 2021 or the amount of capital
you could return?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. One, I wouldn't want to speculate what's going to happen with Evertec. But, obviously, if we have more
capital, that would come into our capital plan, and we'll look at it. I wouldn't necessarily assume that any one-time
capital [ph] shot we get from any sort (00:37:43) that the Fed will necessarily let us distribute it out immediately.
So, that's about all I think we could say on that.

Thank you.

Hey, Brock.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Just a big picture question, first. Anything new in terms of population growth trends on the island?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
No. We haven't seen anything. The most recent migration trends show that the number of people leaving the
island had decreased dramatically. I don't know how much that is tied to the pandemic. Obviously, [ph] if foot
traffic together with that (00:38:39) definitely, people, to the extent that economic opportunities in the States aren't
great right now, [ph] it's less than incentive for (00:38:48) people to leave, and also the federal stimulus was very
generous. So, it's natural to see why that decreased. Those statistics lag a little bit. And there hasn't been much
movement on new birth, which is obviously something that's very important, too. Our birth rate has gone down as
in many parts of the world, but that is something we haven't been able to change very much. So, I think, in
general, the positive, less migration, but still the birth rate is generally low.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
And despite the sort of flat – by the way, compared to the last 10 years, a flat population is pretty good for us. But
it's always important to not forget that, even though we have a flat – roughly a flat population rate probably for the
last year-and-a-half or two, we continued to grow our clients.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. And, I think, one thing that people don't realize is that even with a flat population scenario, home –
households do increase, obviously, not at the same rates. So, independent households, children go out and buy
their own homes, and we're seeing that in Puerto Rico. We've talked about it earlier. There is a healthy demand
now for mortgages, but in – as opposed to in the States or maybe a 70/30 refinance; in Puerto Rico, it's still about

50/50. So, there's a strong demand for homes. There hasn't been a lot of supply. So, even if the households
increase, slowly that's creating a good momentum for the households – for the housing sector.

Got it. Okay. And shifting over to the loan book, if you could just remind me what your total construction book is
and the mix between Puerto Rico and the US and average loan to cost?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Our total loan book is $936 million, of which the majority is in the US, $740 million is in the USA, so the rest will be
in Puerto Rico. Loan to costs, I mean, I didn't provide that in sort of my prepared remarks, but it will be in the [ph]
6%, starts with a 6% (00:41:04), thereabout.

Operator: The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning, gentlemen.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Hello. How are you, Gerard?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good. Can you give us an update? I think the Trump administration came out in September and announced a $13
billion aid package for Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria. Is that money in addition to what was promised Puerto
Rico when the hurricane hit about three years ago, or is this just part of that original plan? And how do you see
the money flowing into the economy?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
No, that was actually part of the original plan. I mean, the numbers we have right now, basically, for hurricane
relief is about $62 billion was allocated and about $17 billion has been dispersed. So, the difference is there to be
dispersed. Also, independent of the hurricane relief, we have the CARES Act relief for the COVID, which was
about $13.9 billion. And this is – these estimates are now as strong as the first ones. [ph] You can get it from the

website (00:42:29). But we estimate about $9.2 billion of [indiscernible] (00:42:31). So, there's about $50 billion.
That number you heard is about $50 billion of federal aid left to be spent.
Now, I believe – I don't believe that the pace is picking up. As you saw, they reached an agreement with the
federal government for the restoration of the electrical system, which was the single biggest ticket item out there.
And it's progressing albeit slowly, but it's progressing faster than it was. These monies, especially the hurricane
relief money, will not be spent in a year, two years, three years, even four years. I mean, it may take 7, 8, 10
years to spend this money. So, it'll be there for a while.
The COVID relief is a bit different. A lot of that was supposed to be spent by December 31. So, we'll see what
happens with that. [ph] We've got (00:43:20) a little rush to spend it or lose some of it or it gets extended. So,
that's – obviously, there's a lot of money to be spent there in that X. If there's a federal stimulus package for the
whole country and if we get treated more or less equal to the States as we were in the last one, we can expect
there'll be a lot more money coming in the way also.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And could you quickly – what's the gross state product of Puerto Rico, just to put it in context because, obviously,
it's an enormous amount of money that will put a support in the economy over a multiyear period. Do you have
about what the gross state product is of Puerto Rico?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. The gross domestic product includes pharmaceuticals and that is about $70 billion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Okay. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks that cement sales were quite strong.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can you kind of share with us, is it more due to federal programs like we're talking about now or is it more in the
private sector, and is it more commercial versus consumer-related?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I think there's a little – I want to give you a sort of a political answer. It's a little bit of everything. There are –
obviously, some of the FEMA money is beginning to come out for infrastructure projects and municipal projects.
But you're also seeing an immense amount of home improvement in Puerto Rico as you are in the States. As
people's liquidity went up and they couldn't travel, people are fixing up their homes, they're building pools. They're
doing things that require cement.

So – and you're seeing buildings being rebuilt after the hurricanes, some from insurance [indiscernible] (00:45:02)
came out a year ago. So, for example, the Ritz Hotel in Isla Verde has just announced that they had settled with
the insurance companies not too many months ago and haven't even begun to rebuild. So, we really have a little
bit of everything. It's just not government. There is a lot of [ph] competitors (00:45:20) and a lot of home rebuilding
going on in Puerto Rico right now – home improvement.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, shifting over to your comments about the branch closures in the five boroughs of New York,
can you share with us, did the COVID problem accelerate plans to close these branches and what metrics do you
use to determine to close these branches or is it foot traffic? I know you mentioned a lower profitability, but what
metrics were you guys focused on? And could you use any of this type of an analysis in either Florida or even in –
even on the Island in Puerto Rico...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
...just to make it more efficient?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Well, we looked at a number of metrics, like you said, foot traffic, the level of deposits, profitability, sales in those
branches. We looked at all of those. And basically, these were our most underperforming branches. So, we really,
in the end, we felt that they probably subtracted more than they added to the retail or the strength of the retail
franchise. And so, it was a very detailed analysis. We do this kind of analysis for all of our branches. We don't see
– in Florida, we have only 11 branches and all of our branches in Florida are profitable. So, we don't really see
much there. And in Puerto Rico, the same thing, I mean, in Puerto Rico, we – our branches are our source of
strength. They are large deposit gatherers. But even more importantly, they're large centers of sales for our
consumer loan products.
People don't recognize that the percentage of branches in Puerto Rico compared to the United States is much
lower. In the United States, the most recent numbers that I saw is that we have 33 branches for every 10,000
inhabitants. In Puerto Rico, that number is 11. In Puerto Rico, since 2010 with the consolidation, the population of
Puerto Rico has decreased by 7%, the number of branches has decreased by 33%. So, our branches still in
Puerto Rico have a lot of transactional activity. They're sales generators. And they're very low cost to operate
compared to the New York market. Our real estate costs here are very low, and even our personnel costs are
lower. That's [ph] something (00:47:40) we're always looking, and maybe there could be a handful of branches
down the road that we could close. But we are looking at the same metrics, but they just pan out differently in both
Puerto Rico and Florida.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. And just final question. Carlos, I think in your prepared remarks, you touched on the capital action plans
will be addressed in the spring of 2021. Right now, as we all know, the Federal Reserve for the largest banks has

suspended the share repurchase programs through the end of the year. If that suspension remains in place
through, let's say, June of next year, would that influence your guidance decision on your capital action plans of
doing another buyback, for example?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Well, I mean, we're going to – by the end of the year, when the Fed comments on the CCAR resubmission of the
largest banks, we're going to get a lot more information on how the Fed is thinking about banks and capital plans
and dividends and share repurchases. So, we'll add that to our analysis and how we structure our discussions
with them. There are – increasingly, there is a – while the restriction is there and very clear for the largest banks,
there's an increasing number of banks – smaller banks that have reinstituted their buybacks, I mean, increasing
number of banks over $10 billion. In the beginning, they were all under $10 billion in assets. Now, significant
number of banks over $10 billion are securing it.
And while the Fed has been very clear that they want to be conservative on bank capital, they've also stated the
intent to continue to make the [ph] case (00:49:24) decisions on a bank-by-bank basis. So, at the end of the day,
no banks in our asset range that I know of have tested that intent. And with the information we'll gain between
now and year-end, we'll try to make an intelligent judgment of what makes sense. Obviously, we have a very
strong capital position and that starting point will be reflected in our discussions with them.

Glen Manna Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
We heard anecdotally from a bank on the mainland that the SBA had hired about 1,600 people to work on the
loan forgiveness program, which, I guess, given the size of the program, they're going to be really busy. So what
gives you confidence that the bulk of the forgiveness process will be substantially completed by 4Q 2020?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Well, basically, this is our best estimate or guess based on our consultations with our clients. Many of our clients
are eager to get this done. Now, that's not a guarantee. This is a new process. We've put in a portal. [ph] With the
help, perhaps, the (00:50:50) SBA can process these things, but basically, based mostly on our conversations
with clients and their desire to get this thing wrapped up as quickly as possible.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glen Manna Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And I guess regardless of the timing, I would assume that you guys would be getting a pretty big check
from the federal government from all these loan forgivenesses and that would kind of increase your excess
liquidity. Would you have any plans for kind of deploying that, would you put it into the securities book or would
you kind of – I know some of the excess liquidities have been kept short term related to the government deposits.
But is this something that you might feel a little bit more comfortable kind of extending duration on?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Carlos, can you answer that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, we have already done some of that, Glen, and it's a little bit lost, because you're looking at
variances in our investment portfolio in a more aggregate level. But we have already moved some of the cash and
the investments we had in shorter-term treasuries to longer duration agency MBSs. That's about – we shifted
about $3 billion that way in the third quarter.
We're always in our weekly ALCO committee. We continue to reassess. We should extend more of our cash and
that decisions are made dynamically. But the answer to your question, we've done some of it already and we will
continue to reassess if we should do more moving forward. And we have to be attentive as we mentioned, as
Ignacio mentioned, first, the Government of Puerto Rico has a lot of money in their accounts related to the
CARES Act. And again, theoretically, if that is not used by year-end, it is supposed to be given back some way.
Now, the Congress may legislate to extend that, a lot of things may change between now and then. But there
could be significant outflows that happen and we have to be attentive as well. But bottom line, yes, we –
dynamically, we assess our investment portfolio. Yes, we actually have extended maturity already during the third
quarter for significant amount, and we will continue to considerate it in the fourth quarter.

Okay. Great. Thanks. And just remind me again where we have the possibility of a change of administrations here
on the mainland? And one of the candidates' plan could be an increase in the corporate tax rate. And just remind
me again, that increase in the rate would only be applicable to your mainland-sourced income?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. That is correct. What you have to keep an eye on is that our legislators in Puerto Rico tend to be a little bit
of copycats. So, sometimes when the rates go up in the States, they want to follow suit. But as it stands now, that
is correct. The change in federal taxes will affect only the income, our US based – mainland US-based income.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
