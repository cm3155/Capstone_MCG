Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
...hello? In the second quarter we earned $283 million in pre-tax, pre-provision income on total revenue of $445
million. Our pre-tax, pre-provision income grew by 8% linked quarter or 33% annualized, and we expect it to
continue to grow in the second half of the year. Quarter-over-quarter, our pre-tax, pre-provision profitability
expanded by 6 basis points to 2% of average assets, reflecting East West's attractive core earnings power.
Asset quality has remained healthy with improvements in every metric. Because of this, and a more constructive
macroeconomic forecast, we recorded a negative $15 million provision of credit losses in the second quarter
compared with a zero provision in the first quarter. In sum, we returned an attractive 1.56% on average assets,
16.6% on average equity and 18.3% on average tangible equity for the second quarter of 2021.
Slide 4 presents a summary of our balance sheet. As of June 30, 2021, total loans reached a record of $40.1
billion, including $1.4 billion of Paycheck Protection Program loans. Excluding PPP, total loans grew by 12%
annualized from March 31, 2021. Second quarter production was distributed across residential mortgage, C&I and
commercial real estate. Year-to-date for the first half of 2021, loans excluding PPP grew 10% annualized. Based
on the current pipeline and expectations, we increase our full year outlook for long growth to a range of 9% to
10%, up from 8% previously.
As you can see on this slide, our portfolio is somewhat equally weighted between the three major loan types. This
differentiates East West from many other regional banks. We also benefit from a geographic footprint with
locations in dynamic metropolitan areas. We believe that this diversification is a strength that provides multiple
engines of growth and reduces credit concentration risk. We are positive about a trajectory of loan growth across
our business lines. Our retail branch network is an excellent source of new consumer and commercial banking
relationships. We continue to see high origination volumes for single family mortgages and home equity lines of
credit, which we primarily originate through our branches.
Furthermore, through our retail branches, we are also growing small business, C&I loans and smaller size
multifamily and commercial real estate mortgages. Our commercial lending teams, including our specialty lending
verticals, serve our middle market and corporate C&I and CRE customers. The teams are expanding existing
customer relationships and gaining new market share, driving solid balance sheet growth.
In the second quarter, deposit growth continued to be very strong. As of June 30, 2021, total deposits reached a
record of $52.6 billion, up $3 billion or 25% annualized from March 31. Noninterest bearing deposit grew $2.9
billion or 61% annualized to a record $21.8 billion as of quarter end, making up 41% of total deposits, up from
38% a quarter ago and up from 34% a year ago.
Similar to loans, our deposit growth was also well diversified across our consumer, small business, [indiscernible]
(00:07:27) and cross-border customer segments; reflecting our ability to win new accounts and expand wallet
share of existing ones. Over the last several years, we invested in cash management products and risk
management solutions that allow us to better serve larger, more complex businesses. We also invested in
consumer and commercial digital banking platforms with cross-border capabilities. We are pleased with the
deposit generation and the related increase in deposit account fees, which were up 60% year-over-year to $17.3
million.
Turning to slide 5, you can see our strong capital ratios as of June 30, 2021, with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of
12.8% and a total capital ratio of 14.3%, which provides us with meaningful capacity for future growth. East West
Board of Directors has declared third quarter 2021 dividends for the company's common stock. The common
stock cash dividend of $0.33 is payable on August 16, 2021 to stockholders of record on August 2, 2021.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Moving on to a discussion of our loan portfolio beginning with slide 6. C&I loans outstanding, excluding PPP, were
$12.4 billion as of June 30, 2021, an increase of 12% annualized from March 31. Total C&I commitments were
$17.7 billion as of June 30, a sequential increase of 10% annualized. On an average basis, C&I loans, excluding
PPP, grew by 6% annualized in the second quarter.
Growth was well-diversified by industry and reflected great performance across our footprint and teams. I would
highlight general C&I production in California as well as contribution from our China and New York-based teams.
By industry, I would highlight entertainment, clean energy and general manufacturing and wholesale.
Slide 7 and 8 showed essential details of our commercial real estate portfolio. Total commercial real estate loans
were $15.4 billion as of June 30, 2021, up by 8% annualized from March 31st. From the past several quarters, our
origination volume especially from smaller-sized CRE clients has been consistent. We also benefit from our
geographic footprint outside of California. In the second quarter, Texas bolstered overall CRE growth.
In slides 9 and 10, we provide details regarding our residential mortgage portfolios. During the second quarter, we
originate $1.2 billion of residential mortgage loans, an increase of 5% sequentially. This was a record quarter of
residential mortgage origination for East West. And although we expect this to slow as the market changes, good
momentum is continuing into the second half of the year. Residential mortgage loans were $10.7 billion as of
June 30, 2021, growing by 18% annualized from March 31.
I will now turn the call over to Irene for a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Dominic. I'll start with asset quality metrics on slide 11. Overall, we're very pleased that all of our key
asset quality metrics improved quarter-over-quarter. Total criticized loans were down by 15% to $1 billion as of
June 30, 2021, or 2.6% of total loans. We saw improvement across all significant loan portfolios.
Non-performing assets were down by 13% to $226 million, or 38 basis points of total assets, as of June 30. The
broad-based improvement in asset quality included our oil and gas portfolio. A better operating environment for
the sector drove several upgrades. This, along with workouts, payoffs, and paydowns, reduced oil and gas
criticized loans to 26% and non-accrual loans to 7% of the portfolio. Accordingly, we released $34 million of loan
loss reserves. Allowance coverage of oil and gas loans was 9.8% as of June 30, compared with 11.6% as of
March 31.
On slide 12, we present the component of our allowance for loan losses. Our allowance totaled $586 million as of
June 30, or 1.52% of loans excluding PPP, compared with $608 million, or 1.62%, as of March 31, and compared
with 1.39% on day one post CECL. Net charge-offs decreased to $13.3 million in the second quarter from $13.4
million in the first quarter. The second quarter net charge-off ratio was 13 basis points of average loans
annualized, an improvement of 1 basis point from 14 basis points annualized in the first quarter. During the
second quarter, we recorded a negative $15 million provision for credit losses compared with zero provision in the
first quarter. Currently, we do not expect to report a provision for credit losses in the second half of the year.
And now, moving on to a discussion of our income statement on Slide 13. This slide summarizes the key line
items of the income statement, which I'll discuss in more detail on the following slides. I'd like to flag a couple of
non-cash items and non-interest income. Other investment income increased by $7 million sequentially, reflecting
higher valuations of CRA, SBIC investments during the quarter. Included in interest rate contracts and other

derivatives are mark-to-market adjustments, which were a $5 million loss in the second quarter compared with a
$14 million gain in the first quarter. These primarily relate to changes in the credit valuation adjustment.
The second quarter income tax expense was $46 million, and the effective tax rate was 17%. The year-to-date
effective tax rate for the first half of 2021 was 15%. And we expect that the full year effective tax rate will also be
15%.
I'll now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slides 14 through 17, starting
with the average balance sheet. Second quarter average loans of $39.6 billion grew by $900 million or 9% linked-
quarter annualized, and by 10% linked-quarter – excuse me, 10% annualized, excluding PPP. As Dominic
discussed, growth was broad-based across our major loan portfolios and strongest from residential mortgage.
Second quarter average deposits of $50.2 billion were up by $2.3 billion or 20% linked-quarter annualized. Aside
from time deposits, all other deposit categories increased, led by non-interest-bearing demand deposits at a rate
of 36% annualized. As a result, our average loan-to-deposit ratio was 79% in the second quarter, down from 81%
in the first quarter.
Our average earning asset growth in the second quarter reflected the strong deposit growth year-to-date. On
average basis, securities available for sale increased by $1.5 billion, and repo assets increased by $700 million.
This was partially offset by a $1 billion decline in average interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents, as we
deployed some of our excess liquidity. Overall, the mix of average earning assets was higher yielding in the
second quarter. During the second quarter, $400 million of FHLB funding, which carried an effective interest rate
of 2.25% matured and was paid off.
Turning to slide 15, second quarter 2021 net interest income of $376 million was the highest quarterly net interest
income in the history of East West, growing by 26% linked-quarter annualized. Quarter-over-quarter, the net
interest margin expanded to 2.75% in the second quarter, an increase of 4 basis points from the prior quarter.
Income related to PPP loans was $15 million in the second quarter and included $11 million of deferred loan fees,
similar to the amount in the first quarter. As of June 30, 2021, we had $26 million of PPP deferred loan fees
remaining to accrete into income.
As you can see in the waterfall chart on this slide, the 4 basis point quarter-over-quarter increase in the net
interest margin breaks down as follows: plus 3 basis points each from a lower cost of interest-bearing deposits
and from the deployment of excess liquidity, partially offset by minus 1 basis point each from lower other earning
asset yields and lower loan yields. The lower cost of deposits more than offset the drag to net interest margin
from lower yields and the deployment of excess liquidity expanded the net interest margin in the quarter.
In our updated outlook, we expect the full year net interest income, excluding PPP, will grow by 10% to 11% year-
over-year, which is just ahead of our anticipated loan growth of 9% to 10%. This reflects the impact of securities
available for sale and repo asset purchases in addition to net interest income expansion, driven by loan growth.
Turning to slide 16. The second quarter average loan yield was 3.57% and excluding the impact of PPP, the
adjusted loan yield was 3.58%, down slightly by 2 basis points from 3.60% in the first quarter.
Turning to slide 17, our average cost of deposits for the second quarter dropped to 14 basis points, an
improvement of 4 basis points from the first quarter. The spot rate of total deposits as of June 30 was 13 basis
points, down by 3 basis points from March 31.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Our cost of deposits declined as maturing higher rate CDs repriced to current market rates, and we decreased
rates paid on money market and interest-bearing checking accounts. We expect to further reduce our cost of
deposits as the maturing CDs reprice over the second half of 2021, although the impact of this will diminish after
that. The average cost of CDs in the second quarter was 40 basis points, a drop of 10 basis points from the first
quarter. In the second quarter, we originated a renewed $4.5 billion of domestic CDs at a blended rate of 19 basis
points and a weighted average duration of four months. We have $927 million of CDs maturing in the third quarter
at a blended rate of 55 basis points and another $1 billion in the fourth quarter at a blended rate of 35 basis
points.
Moving on to fee income on slide 18, total non-interest income in the second quarter was $68 million. And this
reflects the non-cash items noted on slide 13. Second quarter fee income and net gains on sales of loans were
$63 million, up by $8 million or 15% from the first quarter. Higher transaction volume and new customer
acquisition growth helped the increases in customer-driven foreign exchange income, lending fees, wealth
management and deposit account fees. Fee income growth momentum is continuing into the third quarter. And
we expect these business lines to show strength for the full year. Quarter-over-quarter, interest rate contracts
revenue decline, reflecting lower customer transaction volumes and demand in the current interest rate
environment.
Moving on to slide 19. Second quarter non-interest expense was $189.5 million. Excluding amortization of tax
credits and other investments and core deposit intangible amortization, adjusted non-interest expense was $161.5
million in the second quarter, a decrease of $3 million or 2% sequentially. This reflects careful expense
management and a quarter-over-quarter decrease in compensation and employee benefits from a seasonally
high first quarter. Year-over-year, adjusted non-interest expense increased by 5%.
The second quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 36.3%, compared with 38.7% in the first quarter. Importantly, we
achieved our efficiency ratio not just through expense management but through increased revenue. Reinforcing
our revenue growth is our continuous investments of people and technology to expand our banking capabilities
and product offerings.
And with that, I'll now review our updated full year outlook for 2021 on slide 20. We've updated our full year
outlook for 2021 relative to a quarter ago. For the full year of 2021 compared with our full year 2020 results, we
expect year-over-year loan growth, excluding PPP, in the range of 9% to 10%, up from our prior outlook of
approximately 8%. Year-over-year, adjusted net interest income growth, excluding PPP, in the range of 10% to
11%.
We've adjusted our outlook to incorporate the impact of year-to-date securities and repo purchases, which we
expect will lift net interest income growth ahead of loan growth. Adjusted non-interest expense growth, excluding
tax credit investment amortization, of 5% year-over-year, unchanged from our prior outlook.
Based on our macroeconomic forecast and loan growth outlook, at this point, we do not expect to book a
provision for credit losses in the second half of the year. Full year 2021 effective tax rate of approximately 15%
including the impact of tax credit investments, unchanged from our prior outlook.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Dominic for closing remarks.

Thank you, Irene. In closing, we had a very strong second quarter and expect that to continue for the rest of the
year, while the hard work and excellent execution by all of our associates drive our results and is a true testament
of the culture of East West.
I would now open up the call to questions. Operator?

Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first
question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess, just first question maybe for Irene for you around cash management. You've been buying into the AFS
portfolio as well as the repos. Just give us a sense of how you're thinking about holding on to excess liquidity.
What is the duration of these assets that you're adding? And just overall asset sensitivity of the bank as we think
about eventually short rates going higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. Great question, Ebrahim. Certainly, I think our view from what we – the actions that we took in the first
quarter have shifted a little bit with the long-term rates coming down. So although we do expect to redeploy some
of our excess cash, we're a little bit shy as far as going out too long. And I think we'll be a little bit more cautious
than the actions that you saw we took in the first quarter when the tenure was higher and we redeployed about $2
billion into a longer duration securities and repos. The repos are variable rate. I think that's more attractive for us
in the current environment. And the securities that we're buying right now probably about – largely MBS, CMOs;
about [ph] 1.5% (00:24:12) kind of rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess separate question, Dominic, for you. Loan growth seems to be very strong. Deposit growths
are very strong. Give us a sense now that you had like six to nine months under the Biden administration, the
headlines around US-China still suggest a lot of tension. How is that impacting your growth outlook? How you're
going about growing the bank? Because that's something that consistently keeps coming up from an investor
standpoint when they, say, think about East West.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good question. Well, first of all, I think in the second quarter, we are growing nicely in China and our cross-border
business. And I think that has a lot to do with, well, the political mavericks out there is always going to be there
because that seems to be something that gain a lot of traction among politicians and so forth.
But if you look at the business, there are still, obviously, a lot of business going on between US and China. And
now, the headline news about some of the large investment may not be coming, but you have to understand from
East West Bank perspective, we are mainly focusing on the middle – mid-sized business and they are not the
high-profile business. And then they are not a highly-sensitive kind of business like artificial intelligence or very
much high-tech stuff. So from our perspective, plenty of our clients continue to do cross-border business and they
are doing fine.
And now we also have to reflect back on for the last four years. Under the Trump administration, there are a lot of
the – not only just rhetorics but also actual enforcement of tariffs. Our clients navigated through. It wasn't easy.
And East West Bank navigated through. And in fact, every single year we had growth for the last four years. And
in terms of overall risk management, we're doing great.
Reason being is that, this is our strength. We have the expertise in the cross-border US-China space. And this is
something that we are really good at. If I look at just the last two quarters, we have very diversified growth in our
China operation and we have very diversified growth in US from a cross-border business and spread from clean
energy, general manufacturing, wholesale, consumer goods to private equity, et cetera. So we have a pretty
broad base of growth opportunity.
I think one of the things I really want to highlight is that the reason of the growth is not that unlike the multinational
companies or the money center banks who actually for the last six months or so has been stepping up and
investing in China. You heard the news about JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, they are all stepping
up and investing more in China. The Standard Chartered, HSBC they are talking about hiring thousands of people
in Hong Kong. We're not doing any of that. We've been very, very consistent to focusing on our strategy of being
the bridge between East and West, and selling cross-border business. But what we have done is, over the last
few years, we talked about it in the quarterly earnings release often. That is that, we continue to make investment
in technology, in cash management product capability, assets capability, et cetera.
The whole idea is that we build a platform, we build product capability that fit the customer needs during the
cross-border business, whether they're US companies exporting to China, importing from China or maybe having
investment in China or vice versa, we're providing the product capabilities to support them. Four, five years ago, it
was half aspiration, half capability. Today, we have a lot more capability from a technical standpoint. So when you
see the growth of fee income and treasury management, when you see the fee income of foreign exchange, [ph]
that (29:00) we have this record fee income in this quarter.
And a deposit – a nice deposit growth, DDA, and so forth, and together with loans is no surprise because we have
built up the capability to allow us to expand not only with new customer relationships but also getting a larger
wallet share for many of our existing customers who maybe four years ago weren't able to do certain type of – like
foreign exchange or maybe certain type of cash management relationship with us because the little bit lack of
capability in the past that we were able to correct that. So, our digital offering and our online offering are much
stronger and we'll continue to build that. And in the next few years, we'll continue to focus on building that
capability because the market opportunities is enormous for East West Bank that have the strong expertise to
continue to expand in this direction.

Operator: The next question will come from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thank you. Good morning. I guess, when you think about loan growth on a go forward basis, obviously resi
mortgage has just been such an amazing driver of that growth. But when we think − when you look out to the
second half of the year, maybe into 2022, does resi continue to be the main driver or do you think the C&I could
actually start picking up a fair bit from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I've been predicting the demise of single-family mortgages for the last four, five years and I was wrong every
single year. So somehow every two quarter, I start talking internally with our team and saying that I'm not sure
that single-family mortgages origination can sustain in this level. And so my mortgage department continue to
pleasantly surprise me because I thought fourth quarter last year was that all-time high. There's no way that we
can ever beat that. And then first quarter just beat that. And then, then I thought it will be over and then second
quarter come in and then become record performance again.
Now, at some point, being prudent [indiscernible] (00:31:25) expect that, at some point [ph] it will suffice
(00:31:27). But then I would say that looking at the pipeline today and looking at the origination that still seems to
be going, when we will slow down? I don't know yet. But in the meantime, we are very confident with our C&I
growth and our CRE growth. Our approach has always been, we're going to try to do it in a very balanced
approach. This whole pie chart that we share that we have of somewhat equally distributed type of balance sheet
in terms of somewhat equal weight of C&I, CRE and single-family. And so, if one particular area is slowing a little
bit, hopefully the other two will pick up. And so far that's been working just like that.
And I would expect that maybe when economy start picking up even more and East West continue to – so far
we've been able to – for the last 12, 24 months, we've been continuing getting new C&I customers. And it just –
as a matter of math, because we get so many new C&I customers, at some point, the balance will grow. And so I
expect that, that C&I will continue to grow. And hopefully, at a time that single-family start slowing down a little bit,
the C&I will step up a little bit more. So that's what we see at this point. But so far, things look pretty good.

Okay. Great. And then my second question, really quick. Maybe one for Irene. I guess, when you guys originally
said you do not expect a provision expense this year, I originally thought you meant zero, but obviously it came in
below that. Is it fair to assume that a – or is it fair to expect a negative provision expense in the back half of the
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Ken, my original expectation was that it would be zero along with your expectation and interpretation of our
guidance. I think at this point, given our portfolio, given the trajectory, we're comfortable with, say, a zero provision
for the second half of the year depending on the economic outlook, largely for the different models that we run
driven by the unemployment rate, the 2-10 year treasury spreads, GDP growth, I think it's within the realm of
10

possibility. It could go negative. But certainly I think from our perspective we want to be cautious with the
provision and the negative provision. So I'm comfortable with the zero provision for the second half of the year.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I guess, my first question more on liquidity. And when you look at the commercial customers that are stepping
back up and borrowing today, are they doing so while still keeping high levels of liquidity on their own balance
sheet? And how should we think about future loan growth? Will that potentially be offset by potential deposit
outflows with the loan-to-deposit ratio normalizing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Jared, well, a lot of the new growth that we've had and the balance increases that you're seeing on the C&I side,
in particular, is really new customer acquisition. I think if you look at it and if we look just in general for our C&I
customers, overall utilization rates are pretty flattish. And overall when we look at the financials of our C&I
customers, we agree, right, people have a lot of cash, they have a lot of liquidity. And that's one of the reasons
the utilization rates aren't increasing, but the balance increases are really from new customer acquisitions. Hope
that helps clarify your question.

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. Yeah. But I guess – okay, yeah, that's good. And then on the fee income side, great growth on fee income
and good guidance there. Are you seeing a sort of pent-up demand coming out now that things are starting to
release, or is this just more of a good return to normal and we should see a steady march higher from here as
volume and capacity continues to increase?

Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I'm pretty sure that some of them is just a bit of a rebound from 2020, in terms of when there are more
vaccination and then the economy opening up a little bit, to a certain degree there's that. But I think again going
back on the East West Bank perspective, we have brought in a lot more new customers.
And also as I shared earlier from the cross-border banking perspective, we have actually not just cross-border
banking, actually, many of our more sophisticated larger-sized clients are signing up with our cash management
services that maybe two, three years ago, certain type of deposit was still reside in some of the money center
banks, and many of them were willing to move more and more of that deposit to us and giving us a larger wallet

share. And that drives these additional fee income in the treasury management services and then, of course, on
the foreign exchange because that there is so much more cross-border both from a consumer and commercial
side. In addition to that, in terms of wealth management. Again, that's a share bringing in more customers,
because that really isn't related to more sophisticated platform and so forth. It's just bringing more customers. And
so we expected that we'll continue to execute in this strategic direction. And our focus is continue to be a
diversified portfolio of client base to allow us to not have to over rely on any concentrated growth risk. And that's
the game plan.

Vilas Abraham Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi, guys. This is the Vilas Abraham in for Brock. Just maybe starting off on C&I growth again. So obviously, very
good. It sounds like customer acquisition is the driver, which is great. And your pricing was also pretty stable
quarter-over-quarter. Have you had to make any trade-offs on pricing or structure to keep some of this momentum
going that you've seen?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We have – again, going back to a very diverse – diversified group – from industry perspective, from geographic
perspective, there are always some type of business that, like, all the community banks or maybe regional banks
are all heavily engaged in. And for those business, there are some competitive pressure. There are others like
some of our cross-border business that we hardly have any competition that we do not have as much pressure.
But, all in all, I think having a diversified portfolio of C&I loans and with many different sectors allow us to
somewhat blend it into where we are today.
So I looked at it is that there's always going to be pressure here and there. But then we'll – we have very unique
value propositions in some of the sectors that allow us to get to kind of like pricing that may get worked out. So
that's why you see that there is stable type of loan yield.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vilas Abraham Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And just my second question, can you talk a little bit more about East West CRE business in Texas that
you alluded to in your remarks? How should we think about the strength of that economy and the migration into
that state as it relates to [ph] your guys (00:40:28) portfolio? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, our Texas team is doing well – doing very well. In fact – well obviously, we would take that oil and gas aside
because that's where we are trying to make sure that we hold it below $1 billion. And that's so far going pretty
well. Obviously the – all the asset quality metrics improved much better but we put that on the side, the C&I and
CRE in Texas are growing. It's a great market. We have very strong talents in that region, and we expect
continued strong growth in Texas.

Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
First question just around loan pricing and given what the curve has done of late, have you seen any change in
terms of the competition on new business here more recently?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
There are always competition in particular in CRE that sort of like keep going down in terms of pricing. And so
frankly, we could have done a lot more if we're willing to just go down the same path. I think opposition is that by
and large, our focus on CREs [indiscernible] (00:42:04) our longtime existing customers and also continue to
develop new relationship. But to a certain degree, we have value-added services that allow us to hold the pricings
maybe slightly better than the downward spiral that are taking – that's going on around some of these other
smaller community banks.
And that's something that we just don't think that is necessary for us to go down that path. And I think that
because many of those other banks – so like based on the yield curve [indiscernible] (00:42:44) price down and I
think eventually when they – the interest rate environment change, it can hurt them in the long run. So we are
looking at both short-term and long-term. So – and just do things prudently in the East West way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then in multifamily you had a nice step up after remaining fairly stable over the last 12 months. Have
you changed your appetite there? And where is that growth coming from within your markets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. That growth is really coming largely from Southern California, and then also to Dominic's point earlier also
our Texas team as well. But no change in our strategy or direction.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
This my – my first question would be on deposit growth. That has been fantastic here. I remember in the first
quarter you said that was going to slow in 2Q. And I guess technically it did but it's still 6%, so congrats there. I
was just wondering, how you see that momentum continuing into the back half of the year, if you're expecting that
to continue to slow but still remain strong?
And then if I heard you correctly, it sounds like you're assuming slower securities growth in your NII guide. So, I
just wanted to confirm that. And then also could you talk about what kind of curve you're factoring into the NII
guide as well? That'd be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, great questions, Dave. Our deposit growth, there's no question with kind of the investments that we made,
the product offering, the space that we're in, cross-border customers, we're acquiring new customers. With that
said, and we see that more strongly with the transaction volume, the product utilization and just the fee income
from that. But with that said, there's no question the kind of macro environment and the other drivers are
contributing to excess kind of liquidity that some of our clients have.
I think what we're really pleased with as far as the deposit growth from consumer and small business and our
retail branches, corporate deposits, commercial deposits, they're all growing nicely, and the fee income and the
core operating accounts are growing. So, we're pleased about that. But also kind of realistic as far as there is
some excess liquidity here and some fluctuations with some of our customer balances. And I think that's why
we're taking maybe more of a – at this point in time especially where the yield curve is – kind of a cautious
approach as far as redeploying some of that longer into securities. We'll still continue to do that as I mentioned but
maybe not at that same pace that we did in the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Okay. And then on the rate side, you're assuming the current curve persists or...
[indiscernible] (00:45:50)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Current curve. That's correct.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
And then – appreciate that. And then maybe just my second question. Can you just quantify the growth you guys
saw in loans and deposits in Hong Kong and China in 2Q? That'd be great. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Growth in loans in Hong Kong and China was pretty good this quarter, about $150 million or so. On the deposit
side, a little bit of an increase but not as much. So, we ended probably about one point – excuse me, $2.8 billion
in Hong Kong and China combined.

Operator: The next question will come from Elan Zanger with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Elan Zanger Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just back on the loan growth, I just wanted to check in on the CRE pay
downs. I think you – you're expecting some elevated pay downs possibly in the second quarter. Did those
happen? Did you see that? And I guess what's the outlook going forward for that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Some do, some don't. And so we expect that those who didn't pay down in the second quarter may pay down in
the third quarter. And so that is something that we'll see, because oftentimes client intention may not necessarily
always work out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Elan Zanger Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. To get to the 5% expense guide, it assumes a decent uptick in costs in the second half. I guess what's
driving those costs higher? And does this kind of bake in some sort of pickup in travel-related costs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. We have in our kind of forecast assumed a little bit more travel-related costs, it's already happening.
Certainly not to kind of a normalized level, but I'll just kind of maybe remind you like for the first half year-over-
year compared to last year, we're at that 5%. So it's really kind of steady from where we're at right now. Most of
the cost increases that we have are related to compensation, employees, new employees that we've hired. We're
making more money, so bonus accruals are higher. There are investments that we made in technology and we're
amortizing that. But as you know, we are very kind of careful in our expense management. And we expect that
we'll continue to do so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We're also giving more money to charity too, and we're doing well, we need to give back to the community.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So with – good morning. Yes, so with the implied and improved operating leverage and the updated guidance,
could there be any plans to pull forward any planned investments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
What do you mean by planned investment? Can you maybe help us define it a little bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Yeah. So I mean, so the ongoing investments in the business but with operating leverage improving, could you
potentially pull forward any investments let's say in next year or use in advance [ph] that you're planning on goal
(00:49:20)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We continue to execute according to our strategic business plan. And from a let's say technology investment
standpoint or people investment standpoint, we continue to just trying to do it in an orderly fashion and not
necessarily that – trying to accelerate based on any particular specific situation. But of course, if there are some –
I mean great opportunity out there that is available, we are always open, flexible and then somewhat
entrepreneurial to take advantage of it. But outside of any of that, I think we just follow our strategy plan and
execute accordingly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And I saw that $400 million in FHLB advances were paid off in the quarter. And I see there's around $250
million remaining. When does that mature, and are you planning to pay that off any time soon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. The rest of the FHLB matures at various points next year. So we expect to pay that off at that point in time.
$175 million in February of next year and another $75 million in November.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Good morning. Maybe a longer term question on credit quality. Obviously the results have been fantastic in part
because of the stimulus. But when we think about the way your business is today and we kind of fast forward one
to two years, how are you thinking about the overall loss in normalized losses for East West today than maybe
pre-pandemic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, that's a great question. I think if you look at our portfolio and categories of loans that we have, the main
category CRE, C&I, and SFR certainly historical experience that we've had from the residential portfolio has been
excellent, right. Losses have been really negligible.
On the CRE side as well, historically ex – if you think about ex construction during the credit crisis, our income
producing CRE has also the credit quality has been good, particularly relative to peers. I think on the C&I side,
what we're trying to do is make sure we don't have too many concentrations in one area or one sector to ensure
that our credit quality is something that continues perhaps kind of the good trajectory we have right now.
So when we look at that, we're very careful. And I think there were some questions earlier during the call as far as
rate versus structure. But particularly I think for the commercial loans, CRE, C&I, we're careful from the
perspective of not giving up a structure or a [ph] covenants for rate (00:52:32).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And if I could just add kind of a modeling question, I think you said 15% of the tax rate. Do you have
what the remaining associated [indiscernible] (00:52:47) would be that runs through the P&L?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, at this point in time, we think it's going to be about $70 million for the rest of 2021. Maybe a little bit more in
the third quarter, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
$70 million, got it. Thank you.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. I had a follow-up on C&I loan growth. Could you talk about the pipeline and the opportunity within
some of the higher growth areas, such as private equity? And I think you called out entertainment and clean
energy, could you talk about that? And any new team hires that's helping that growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We continue to sort of like strategically add new talents into various teams. So for example – but in entertainment,
actually we only add one full-time individual. However, I think just that the team for the last six to nine months has
been going very strong. And what we'll find is that the beauty of this diversification strategy is that we have so
many different industry verticals. And we have so many – well, I wouldn't say so many, we have quite a few – a
very attractive geographic footprint in various areas, such as from New York to Texas to Washington State to
Massachusetts. And then of course, we got our lion's share of business in the State of California. And let's not
forget that we do have Hong Kong and also offices in China.
So they at various time, would have stronger performance one quarter over next. So if you recall, I think last year,
we mentioned private equity quite a bit. The last six months, they have not yet had the kind of strong performance
like entertainment or clean energy. But I would expect that maybe in the next two quarters; I'll start mentioning
them again. So we obviously have many different sectors that we can sort of like get the engine going.
And don't forget, we had substantial balances in the manufacturing, wholesale distribution, and also even
international trade. So, any different sectors can potentially rise up. And it just – I would say that, but if you look at
the second quarter, entertainment, clean energy, and general, C&I related to manufacturing and wholesale, all
those are few that actually have better performance than the others. But it will keep changing, and it will keep
changing. That's the whole idea. Because they are all strong teams, and one way or the other they are going to
be quarters that someone is going to do better than the other and so forth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. Thanks for that. And follow-up on credit quality. You had called out the CECL day one reserve of
1.39%. Is that still the right sort of benchmark to think about where the reserve-to-loan ratio should bottom out
here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I don't have a crystal ball on this, I have to say that. But when we look at – and also I want to kind of point out the
largest driver for this is really the macroeconomic forecast, which is very different than day one CECL. With that
said, I mean I think if you look at the trajectory of where we're at, right, 152 basis points and down from the peak
earlier of close to 180 basis points and CECL day one 139 basis points, I think it's realistic that we can get down
to that level, David.
