Kevin S. Blair
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. Before I begin our call, I
want to take a moment to acknowledge the profound impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton on our community.
The devastation has been immense, affecting countless lives and businesses. However, in the face of such
adversity, we have witnessed incredible resilience and solidarity. Our communities are coming together,
determined to recover and rebuild stronger than ever.
At Synovus, we are committed to supporting these efforts and playing an active role in the recovery process.
Together, we will overcome these challenges and build a brighter future.
Now let's review third quarter results. Synovus reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.18, which included an
$8.7 million Visa valuation adjustment. We reported adjusted diluted EPS of $1.23, which increased 6%
sequentially, primarily driven by stronger net interest income coupled with lower provision for credit losses and
stable adjusted noninterest expense. The most notable financial headlines for the quarter included a sequentially
higher net interest margin, year-over-year adjusted revenue growth of over 2%, driven by a 15% jump in adjusted
noninterest revenue, coupled with an adjusted noninterest expense decline of 1%.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
Finally, our net charge-offs improved again in the third quarter, down to 25 basis points, and our liquidity and
capital positions remain quite strong. Synovus continues to demonstrate progress in various key initiatives. We
are steadily attracting talent in various client facing and corporate services roles.
Noninterest revenue growth remains strong and lending pipelines and production are returning to more elevated
levels. Lastly, I am extremely pleased with the continued progress we are delivering and strengthening our
balance sheet, which positions us well as we close out 2024 and pivot towards a more constructive growth
environment in 2025.
Now, let's turn to slide 3, 4, and 5 for some more specifics on the financial highlights for the quarter. Net interest
income increased 1% from the second quarter as the net interest margin expanded 2 basis points to 3.22%.
Funded loan production rose 8% sequentially and period end loans were up $27 million. We continue to generate
healthy and consistent loan growth in the middle market, CIB, and specialty commercial units, while line utilization
was stable. However, loan pay down and payoff activity and strategic rationalization and non-relationship credit
provided a headwind to third quarter outstandings growth.
Core deposit growth of 1% was attributable to increases in money market and operating deposits. Noninterest-
bearing deposits were more stable in the third quarter with a decline of $94 million sequentially. Furthermore, we
reduced brokered deposits for the fifth consecutive quarter.
Our team remains very focused on accelerating core funding generation through sales activities and product
expansion, while continuing to manage through an overall diminishment cycle. Adjusted noninterest revenue
declined 4% from the prior quarter, primarily from lower capital markets income. On a year-over-year basis,
adjusted noninterest revenue increased significantly, up 15% as there was sharp growth in commercial
sponsorship income from expansion of the card sponsorship business and our partnership with GreenSky.
Capital markets and treasury and payment solutions fees also contributed to a strong year-over-year growth.
Adjusted noninterest expense was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter and down 1% on a year-over-year basis.
Our 2023 cost initiatives, as well as ongoing diligence, have contained overall expense growth year-over-year.
We have also maintained a level of strategic investment that positions Synovus well from a competitive standpoint
in order to drive long-term shareholder value.
On the asset quality front, as expected, net charge-offs were 25 basis points compared to 32 basis points in the
second quarter, while the allowance for credit losses were relatively stable at 1.24%. Lastly, we further bolstered
our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in the third quarter through solid earnings accretion while still completing about
$100 million of opportunistic share repurchases.
Common Equity Tier 1 levels are at their highest in nine years, at 10.65%, and currently sit just above our stated
range of 10% to 10.5%. Our successes are anchored by our team members and their dedication and passion for
delivering the Synovus purpose on a daily basis.
Financially, this was a strong quarter of execution where we posted an adjusted return on average assets of 1.3%
and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 17.1%, while managing down our adjusted tangible
efficiency ratio to 53%. Moreover, we continue to deliver in areas that have presented broader risk concerns
surrounding the industry by lowering credit costs, limiting fraud losses, reducing wholesale funding, and delivering
deposit betas during the easing cycle, all while maintaining elevated levels of capital. We are demonstrating great
progress and momentum that will continue into the fourth quarter and beyond.

And now, I'll turn it over to Jamie to cover the third quarter results in greater detail. Jamie?

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin. Moving to slide 6. Period end loans grew $27 million from the prior quarter.
Loan production, which was up 8% sequentially and 6% year-over-year, has started to show signs of a rebound
within both our CRE and C&I segments. Line utilization was essentially stable. However, increased commercial
loan production was offset by commercial real estate payoffs, consumer softness and continued non-relationship
portfolio rationalization.
Strong year-to-date growth in strategic lending verticals such as middle market, corporate and investment banking
and specialty lines has been essentially offset by paydowns and payoffs and non-relationship loan portfolio
rationalization. We generated $149 million in sequential growth and $604 million or 5% year-to-date growth in
middle market commercial, CIB and specialty lines. This was offset by a $212 million year-to-date decline in
institutional CRE and senior housing loans from market-related activity.
We continue to strategically reduce our non-relationship lending within our national accounts portfolio, as well as
third-party consumer loans, further positioning our balance sheet for core client growth. These balances were
down $78 million in the third quarter and $427 million year to date. Overall, we estimate loans will remain stable in
the fourth quarter, driven by continued growth in our key commercial segments, offset by CRE and senior housing
payoff and paydown activity.
As we look into 2025, we expect the market related and strategic declines to abate, positioning us well to return to
a growth posture that is core to our value proposition.
Turning to slide 7. Period-end core deposit balances rose $295 million or 1% on a linked quarter basis.
Noninterest-bearing deposit balances fell $94 million from the prior quarter, with balances generally exhibiting
more stability throughout the quarter relative to the headwinds experienced over the last year.
There was growth in money market and operating accounts, partially offset by a decline in noninterest-bearing
savings and time deposits. Meanwhile, brokered deposits declined $297 million, or 5% from the second quarter,
which was the fifth consecutive quarter of contraction. Deposit costs rose 4 basis points from the prior quarter to
2.72%, primarily as a result of mix shift and the residual impact of higher average noninterest-bearing deposit
balances in the second quarter. As we ended the quarter, we saw deposit rates begin to decline, led by
reductions in rates on higher beta deposits as well as time deposits.
As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect deposit costs to generally follow the 40% to 45% beta that we have
communicated previously. It is worth highlighting that approximately two-thirds of our core time deposit portfolio
matures within the next five months.
In terms of deposit balance expectations for the fourth quarter, we expect broad-based deposit growth across our
business segments, supported by seasonal public funds tailwind.
Moving to slide 8. Net interest income was $441 million in the third quarter, an increase of 1% quarter-over-
quarter, while the net interest margin was 2 basis points higher at 3.22%. The third quarter now benefited from
various drivers, which included a full quarter impact of the securities repositioning in May and a modest

improvement in asset yields, which more than offset the impact of the aforementioned negative deposit mix shifts
and other lesser factors. Net interest income benefited from the slightly wider net interest margin, with lower
average loan balances during the quarter, serving as a modest headwind.
As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we expect that, in isolation, continued FOMC easing will serve as a
modest headwind to the net interest margin, largely as a result of the repricing lead lag impacts we have outlined
previously. However, opposite that, we expect fixed rate asset repricing, including $750 million in loan hedges
maturing in the fourth quarter, to help support a relatively stable fourth quarter net interest margin. Kevin will
provide further detail on our updated guidance momentarily.
Slide 9 shows total reported noninterest revenue of $124 million. Adjusted noninterest revenue declined 4% from
the previous quarter and increased 15% year-over-year. When looking at the year-ago quarter, core banking fees
increased 6%, supported by growth in treasury and payment solutions, while capital markets fees increased 29%
and commercial sponsorship income rose sharply.
The sequential decline was primarily attributable to a 32% decline in capital markets fees, which were elevated in
the second quarter. Wealth management income rose 1% from the prior quarter, while core banking fees were
relatively flat. We continue to demonstrate strong noninterest revenue momentum relative to peers by investing in
solutions that deepen client relationships and provide healthy growth in areas such as treasury and payment
solutions, capital markets, and wealth management.
Moving to expense. Slide 10 highlights our ongoing operating cost discipline. Reported noninterest expense was
$314 million in the third quarter, which included an $8.7 million Visa valuation adjustment. Adjusted noninterest
expense was relatively stable sequentially and 1% lower from the year ago period.
Employment expense increased 2% from the second quarter, which was offset by a 6% drop in other expense,
primarily attributable to lower legal and other credit-related cost. Employment expense had a modest increase of
1% year-over-year. The increased costs associated with merit and benefit programs were mitigated by our
efficiency efforts, leading to a 4% year-over-year decline in head count.
Occupancy and equipment expense increased 3% as a result of ongoing technology and infrastructure
investments. These items were more than offset by a 9% drop in other expense as a result of lower FDIC
expense and operational losses relative to the same period last year. Importantly, we will remain proactive with
disciplined expense management in this growth-constrained environment.
Moving to slide 11, on credit quality. Provision for credit losses declined 11% from the second quarter to $23
million. Our allowance for credit losses ended the third quarter at $535 million, or 1.24%, which is relatively
unchanged from the prior period, driven by improved overall performance, offset by individually analyzed loans.
Our preliminary analysis of the impact of Hurricane Helene indicates that a specific provision for credit losses is
not necessary at this time.
We will continue to analyze the potential loss impact of both Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Net charge-offs in the
third quarter were $27 million or 25 basis points annualized, compared to 32 basis points annualized in the
second quarter. Nonperforming loans increased $57 million and are now 0.73% of loans, up from 0.59% in the
second quarter, primarily from a single office loan relationship.
The criticized and classified ratio rose slightly to 3.9% and remains at a very manageable level. We maintain a
high degree of confidence in the strength and quality of our loan portfolio, and we will continue to reduce our non-

relationship credits and manage the portfolio with a heightened level of diligence in this more uncertain
macroeconomic environment.
As seen on slide 12, our capital position was stable in the third quarter with the preliminary Common Equity Tier 1
ratio reaching 10.65%, and total risk-based capital now at 13.62%. Another strong quarter for core operating
performance serves as a continued tailwind to our capital position which, alongside a relatively stable balance
sheet, supported us purchasing approximately $100 million in common shares within the quarter while
maintaining relatively stable capital ratios. As a reminder, our focus remains on prioritizing the deployment of our
balance sheet and capital position for core client growth. However, amid the current environment, we have used
share repurchases as a complement to effectively manage within our capital management framework.
As we look to the remainder of the year, we will maintain this disciplined approach, which acknowledges
uncertainty in the current environment and ensures sufficient capital for expected client growth. Our remaining
share repurchase authorization in 2024 is approximately $80 million, which we expect will be fully utilized by year-
end.
I'll now turn it back to Kevin to discuss our fourth quarter 2024 guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jamie. I'll now continue with our updated guidance for the fourth quarter of 2024. Based on year-to-
date results, our current pipelines and expected payoff activity, period-end loans are forecasted to be relatively
flat in the fourth quarter and be down 1% to flat for the full year of 2024. Growth in the fourth quarter will continue
to be driven by middle market, corporate and investment banking, and specialty lending lines.
Our expectations for core deposit growth remain within the 1% to 3% range in the fourth quarter and up 2% to 4%
for the full year, aided by seasonal public funds tailwinds, and new core funding growth initiatives. Our outlook
now points to adjusted revenue of $560 million to $575 million in the fourth quarter, and a range of negative 2.5%
to negative 2% for the full year.
Importantly, our adjusted revenue guidance now assumes a larger amount of rate cuts than our previous
guidance, with 50 basis points of cumulative rate cuts occurring in the fourth quarter.
Net interest margin should be relatively stable in the fourth quarter as a result of lower deposit costs combined
with fixed rate asset repricing and our hedge maturities. Adjusted noninterest revenue growth is forecasted in the
mid-single-digit percentage range for the year.
Our capital markets fee pipeline is building, and we continue to execute on core growth in treasury and payment
solutions. We remain very focused on disciplined expense control. We anticipate our adjusted noninterest
expense will be between $305 million and $310 million in the fourth quarter, excluding the FDIC special
assessment, up approximately 1% for the full year.
Given current credit migration trends and assuming a relatively stable economic environment, we expect net
charge-offs to remain fairly stable within a 25 basis point to 35 basis point annualized range in the fourth quarter,
compared to 33 basis points year-to-date.
Moving to the tax rate, our current forecast points to an approximately 21% to 22% level in the fourth quarter. We
will continue to use share repurchases to manage overall capital near current levels. There is approximately $80

million of share repurchase authorization remaining, which we expect to fully utilize in the fourth quarter. We will
continue to support a strong and liquid balance sheet, which is prioritized toward serving the growth needs of our
clients, regardless of the economic environment.
And now, operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. Let's open the call for questions.

Good morning, Brandon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Jamie, could you expand on your margin expectations beyond the fourth quarter, particularly if we get a more
protracted easing cycle? It seems like with the lag nature of deposits, with that being less of a headwind, we could
see some margin expansion as we get into next year. So I just wanted to get your overall thoughts on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Brandon. As we look at the margin, in the near term, as we said in our guide, we expect the
margin to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter. And that would continue early into 2025, as we expect the
easing cycle to continue as we go through the first half of next year. But when the easing cycle stops, we do
expect to see margin expansion due to the significant amount of fixed rate asset and hedge exposures on the
balance sheet that will be unlocked over time. And so, for us, we think that relatively stable margin in the medium
term. And then, once you get past the easing cycle, we expect to see the margin start to expand as we unlock the
value in those fixed rate exposures.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Got it. So, in other words, in order to see any expansion, you need the Fed to remain on hold? Is that a fair
assumption?

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, it depends on how long the easing cycle is. As we've said before, we believe that we are relatively neutral to
the front end of the curve. And so outside of that lead and lag impact, we do believe that we're neutral to the front
of the curve. And so at some point, the fixed rate asset repricing tailwind will come in regardless of easing or no
easing. And so that will happen. But you're right to think in the medium term, relatively stable on the margin, but
the fixed rate asset repricing will start to flow in as we go through 2025 in any scenario.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Got it. And then lastly, for me, on credit, encouraging to see net charge-offs trend lower. I just
wanted to get an overall sense of the confidence in that net charge-offs can remain sort of in this range for the
foreseeable future. And if there are any concerns as far as tail risk out there within your portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Brandon, this is Bob. I'll take that one. Yeah, we are pretty confident in that guidance range. I mean,
certainly, this quarter was at the lower end of our range, and we're happy with that. But we're holding on that
guidance at 25 basis point to 35 basis point, really based on what we've done in terms of individual loan analysis,
et cetera.
We had an NPL increase this quarter that Jamie spoke of that is baked in there as well. So, yeah, all in all, I think
the guidance is good, certainly in the short term. And then, as we get into 2025, we'll think more about our
guidance, certainly, as we get into the conferences in January.

Jared Shaw Q

Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. I guess maybe the first one, just looking at loan growth
and production, as we go into 2025, is this level of production sort of a good baseline to use?

And can you refresh our memory on sort of what is the balance of those non-core loans that are still out there in
terms of sort of non-relationship CRE, the shared national credits, the third-party consumer that you're talking
about? What's the aggregate headwind that that could be producing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's a great question. And for many reasons, I feel like we're following up on a year where we talked so
much, Jared, about balance sheet optimization. I'm way more optimistic about our prospects to renew our growth
orientation as we enter 2025.
And it's for a couple of reasons. To your first point, production has been consistently growing. When you look
back at kind of our troughed first quarter production, that was the low watermark for us as it relates to funded
production. We've seen the loan production increase in the second quarter and now again in the third quarter up
another 8%. And that would put the third quarter 70% higher than where we were in first quarter. Our pipelines
are fairly stable.
And so we would expect to see production levels to continue to increase for a couple of reasons. Number one, we
think that there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty associated with the election. So once we get the election
behind us, we think that could drive some demand. And two, as rates continue to come lower, we think that could
also stimulate the production side of the equation.
To your point on the strategic runoff or strategic optimization, we've taken the last year to exit and reduce our
exposure in various asset classes that, quite frankly, we just didn't think had the type of return profile that we
wanted. That included our medical office sale, which was around $1.3 billion. We've run down our syndicated
lending portfolio, as well as our third-party consumer lending portfolio. That's about $1.8 billion of year-over-year
runoff, or about 4% of our outstandings. That's largely complete at this point.
We'll continue to see some runoff in the third-party consumer. But this last quarter, that was around $20 million,
so not a substantial amount. So, that headwind has largely been played. And going forward, we shouldn't have
the same impact. Number three, line utilization. Yeah. This quarter, we're roughly at 47% and that's stabilized. We
had seen a decline over the last several quarters.
If you go back to the same period last year, we were at roughly 53%. So just getting back to a normal utilization
rate would provide about $1 billion of incremental growth. And then lastly, we continue to add new talent in middle
market. We're up almost 10 FTEs this year, specialty lending. And we're now starting to expand our sales
resources in our community bank across many of our higher opportunity markets. So, for all of those reasons, I
have greater confidence that 2025 will look more like a normal year for loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. That's great color. Really appreciate the details on that. And just as a follow-up for me. What's the – maybe
for Jamie, what's the impact of those hedge maturities on the hedge costs? You called out the $750 million
hedges maturing in fourth quarter. What's the cost on that? And is there anything, as we look at sort of the first
half of 2025, we should be focused on?

Yeah, those hedges – a couple of things on that. The average rate is 95 basis points in the fourth quarter. There
are $250 million that matured already on October 1, and then $500 million that matures on December 1. When
you look heading into 2025, what you'll see is stability in the balances of the hedge portfolio. But a little bit of
remixing as there's a couple of maturities that come through, and then you have some forward-starting hedges
that start. So, you'll see the effective rate on the hedges increase as we go through early 2025, getting up to
about the 3% area in the second quarter.
And that's the general trend. So the headwind from the hedge portfolio diminishes really as we go through 2025.
And when you get out into the second half of 2025, those rates are not too dissimilar from market rates. And so
the headwind there is expected to really abate as we go through 2025.

Good morning, Timur.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
My first question is around the capital market income in the quarter. It sounded a little bit more pessimistic on the
latest update, and then the numbers still came in pretty good. I guess, in an expectation for the rest of the year, is
there anything chunky that's still coming through, or did some of that chunkiness materialize in 3Q? We'd just love
to get an expectation of what we should see there for the remainder of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Timur, it's a great point, and we are really pleased with the performance of our capital markets business.
And you're right. You look at it, and it's quarter-on-quarter it's down, but that's from a high watermark in the
second quarter. And we are really pleased with kind of where we stand right now. We believe that $10 million a
quarter is a good number to use to build off of. And I would just say, don't forget that this is an environment of low
transaction volume. And so, for the team to be out there delivering solutions to our clients that's driving this $10
million revenue, that's a real positive.
And as we look at the fourth quarter, we're expecting relative stability in capital markets revenue. You clearly will
see mixes between the line items embedded in that business, but we expect stability. But the teams are working
on projects that are lumpy, and they are positives. But we're not including that in any of our guidance today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
I think, Timur, I'd add just when you look at this last quarter at the $10.3 million, about 30% came from derivatives,
about 25% from syndications and lead arranger fees, 15% from debt capital markets, 17% from FX, and about
10% from government-guaranteed loan sales. So it shows you the granularity amongst the categories. And to
Jamie's point, that kind of serves as the baseline for growth going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then maybe a bigger picture question. Again, the update provided, I guess it's close to a month ago
now, relative to the results, the results were pretty meaningfully stronger. I guess, what was the biggest surprise
in the back end of the year that drove the result relative to the last guide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. As we look at what happened here as we wound down the quarter, there were positives across the board
really in PPNR and in credit. And so, if we look at NII, we had outperformance of loan yields versus expectation.
Non-deposit liability cost outperformed, really just strength across the board in NII. And that led to that margin
expansion you saw for the full quarter. Within fee revenue, it was our wealth business that drove the
outperformance in the last month of the quarter. And then, on expenses, a couple of things happened there. We
had a $3 million decline in our FDIC expense, and that impacted our expectations. And then we had various other

kind of timing-related good guys on NIE that just came through in September that were each positive. And so a lot
of good news in the month of September, giving us a nice tailwind heading into the end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And if I could just squeeze one more on credit. Again, encouraged by the loss content, but just looking at
trends in Nonperforming loans and the classified criticize, how close are we in tapping out, especially in the
classified criticized categories? 4%, is that kind of the top here? I guess, any kind of color as to what your internal
expectations are for where classified and criticized loans can top out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Timur , it's Bob again. I would say we're close. I mean, certainly if you looked at the criticized trend, the
rated trend, we were down last quarter, I think, from 3.8% to 3.7%, ticked back up a little bit this quarter to 3.9%.
So we're kind of bouncing a little bit here. I think the bias is still slightly negative, but we've had some upgrades
and certainly we're still having some downgrades. But overall, I think the velocity of that increase is certainly not
as strong as it was. Our grading process does have a little bit of a lag because we're grading on a quarterly basis,
looking back for the most part. So even though rates are beginning to help us, you're still going to have a little bit
of lag effect. So you could see a slight increase. But I think you're close in your comments, around 4%. I think
that's a fair number for us.
We have a very strong risk grading team, very well led. We have a great loan review process internally. So I feel
really good about the accuracy. We get a downgrade occasionally, of course, but overall I think we get really good
marks on the accuracy. And your point around beginning to peak is probably pretty good, and we're pretty close.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I just want to follow up in terms of deposit pricing and just how you're thinking about deposit growth going forward.
So, one, if you could comment on what's the pricing environment, how do you expect deposit betas to behave,
assuming the Fed is able to cut a few times before the end of the year? And then just talk to us about new deposit
acquisition, where are they coming from, and how do you see the mix shift in NIB, IB evolving from here? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, Ebrahim, let me just -- let's dive into the slide or the table we included on the deposit slide in our earnings
deck. We added a third quarter update to the far right. And our intent there was to show what has actually
happened since the easing in the middle of September. And I think it's highly indicative of what we will see going
forward.
And what you see is the team is out there actively working with our clients and focused on reducing the cost of
deposits. And you see going on rate and time deposits, 40 basis points lower than June, implying an 80 beta that
will come through over time. However, if you looked at the end of September time deposit costs, we've only
realized about 20 basis points of decline.
So, while new production would imply an 80 beta, the actual kind of what we've realized to date is around a 40
beta. On brokered, 80% repricing. In the low beta we have a 10% beta. And on the higher beta stuff, we have a
70%.
So if you just kind of use that and use the percent of deposits, what you see is with what we realized to date on
time, the lower number, the 40 beta, you get to about a 35 cumulative total deposit beta realized through
September 30. Now, what we've said is we expected to be 40 to 45. And so, as time deposits flow through and
you realize that 80 beta, that bring that number up to about 42%, and we don't believe that that's the end of the
story. We believe that there's further repricing to go from there.
We believe that brokered could easily end up being about 100 beta. We believe that the low beta and the high
beta have room for improvement. And so, that's what we're looking at on the deposit side for deposit betas and
the easing cycle.
Clearly, it's uncertain how this will go. Our current expectation is to see 25 basis point cuts at sequential meetings,
but it depends on how we go through that, as to how it will all play out.
With regards to deposit growth, we believe, as we said that deposits will grow here in the fourth quarter. A lot of
that has to do with seasonals. We expect to see growth throughout our wholesale bank predominantly as you land
within the lower cost deposits.
And so for the fourth quarter, we would expect to see, as far as percent of total deposits reduction with high cost
time deposits, with brokered deposits and then increase in the percentage weightings of now accounts in money
markets. And so, that's what we were expecting to see here in the near term.
And then as we look into 2024, I would just say that we are expecting to see continuation of core deposit growth.
It is a clear priority for us. We've grown core deposits faster than loans for five consecutive quarters. We expect to

see that continue as we go through 2025. And that'll be a function of general environmental, where we believe,
tailwinds. We believe you'll see less headwinds from monetary policy. We believe we'll see client growth.
And this diminishment headwind that we've seen for multiple years since 2019, we believe that that will slow and
stop. And so, we think that the headwinds that have been slowing core deposit growth will abate. And we'll see
what we've seen in the past, which is strong core client acquisition, client growth, leading to core deposit growth
heading in through 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's very comprehensive. Thank you so much. And just wanted to follow up on our embedded payments
business Maast. We spent a lot of time on the Investor Day a couple of years ago on this. Just remind us where
things stand? It does feel like when you look at top down from the likes of JPMorgan partnering with Oracle, there
is a lot of push towards embedded banking. I think that is something differentiated that Synovus had started. I'm
just wondering how that's gone. Are you as bullish, less bullish relative to when you first launched this initiative?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, Ebrahim, I think to your point, I think the marketplace is speaking where there are competitors that are
rolling out similar products. And as I said last quarter, one of the things that we've recognized is that in order to
have a embedded finance solution that stands out in the marketplace, you've got to have solutions and products
and capabilities that differentiate yourself. And so, we built the beta version that had a MVP product.
As you recall, we had various clients on that platform. And what we're doing today is we're looking at the offering
that we provide and trying to improve some of the value propositions as it relates to the payment facilitation, as
well as some of the depository instruments that sit on the platform. So like anything else, we went out, we piloted,
we saw -- we received the feedback, and now we're working on creating a solution that has a stronger value
proposition. And we'll roll that out in the future with some additional bells and whistles.
But right now, we've taken that same set of resources, and we focus as much on our commercial sponsorship
business where we're looking to increase the amount of revenue that we earn today off of sponsoring merchant
acquiring companies, access to the MasterCard and Visa rails. That's about a $15 million, $20 million revenue
business for us today. And that same group that's working on Maast is working on enhancing the population of
clients that we use there. And then, once we have that, we can also offer the Maast solution to those ISOs, not
just to the software vendors. So, know that we're working on the product and we'll come out in a future quarter
and talk about what the enhancements are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And you don't think scale is a disadvantage relative to the larger regionals or the big money center banks relative
to what you're trying to do?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
No. I think scale matters less there. It's about the partnerships and relationships that you're able to create with
those independent software vendors or ISOs. And what we've said in the past, one of the reasons we felt that we

had a right to win in that space is we've been in this payments business for a long time, dating back to our TSYS
ownership.
And so, to me, it's much more – if you have the right product, it's about applying the right partnership and being
able to add value to that client. I mean, that's what embedded finance really is, is you're creating a new revenue
stream for that ISO or that independent software vendor. So, I don't think scale matters as much as having
partnerships, but you got to have a product that's going to generate revenue for that client.

now open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Bob, I had a credit question for you. Thank you for the detail on the multifamily book in
the slides. Can you give us an update on sort of how the criticized ratios look for that or how you would anticipate
those play out the next few quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Chris, thanks for the question. Yeah, multi-family, if you look at it overall, we have – I don't think
there's certainly zero non-accruals in multifamily and very little, if any, substandard loans.
So, most of that is what we would classify as a special mention migration in multifamily due primarily to some
oversupply issues that we see in various markets and with construction projects coming online in the face of some
oversupply. However, from a loss content perspective, we feel really good about our multifamily book. It's certainly
been a business that we've been bullish on for years.
We're very good at it. We like where we are. Our sponsors in that space really good. So, overall, yeah, a little bit
of negative migration there. But from a loss content perspective, we just don't see it. And once we kind of get
through a little bit of time and some of the oversupply issues begin to abate in various markets, I think we're still
long term -- feel really good about multifamily, particularly in light of the housing environment, as you're aware.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. And then just a general question on overall, the credit migration we saw in Nonperforming. So there's
typically already criticized in prior quarters and so that's just kind of moving through the pipeline.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Short answer is yes. And in this particular case, we had an office credit, office relationship that we moved to non-
accrual. If you back that out, I know it's easy for me to do that, but if you back that out, our non-accruals actually
would have decreased slightly.

So, it's a one credit story there that we've been working through for some period of time. And, we obviously have
gone through our process as well, feel good about where we are there and just continuing to work through that
credit, just couldn't hold it from an accrual perspective. But yes, it was rated before.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got it. And generally speaking, the lower rate environment that we now have is going to make it easier, more
flexible for you to work through credits as time passes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, it certainly doesn't hurt. So that's a good point. As we mentioned earlier, Chris, there's a little bit of a lag
effect on the ratings where you're typically looking at the previous quarter. And so it'll take some time. And the
other point I would make on grading is that -- it's a little bit slower upgrading than it is downgrading. So, I think as
you get into 2025, a little bit further, you'll start to see some benefit there. But generally speaking, the lower rates
would certainly help.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Chris, we've talked about this in prior quarters and some of the conferences. We're going to have some
volatility, as Bob mentioned, on the criticized and classified, even NPL. But the thing that gives us confidence is
when we look at those loans that are in non-accruing status, they're largely 8 to 10 loans that represent 80% of
the balance.
So, to Bob's earlier point, we're doing individual loan analysis to understand what the loss content would be. And I
hope that you get the same confidence that we get when we give out the 25 basis point to 35 basis point
guidance, which is largely lower than what we've experienced year to date, that even with some of these
migrations, we're not expecting any material increase in loss content.
And at the end of the day, that -- you'll see some movement there. But I think that's the bottom line of the story.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
Hi. Good morning. On slide 6, you note the good growth in C&I balances you saw during the quarter. But line
utilization was relatively stable. I guess, what will it take to see that utilization rate increase? Is it more rate cuts,
getting past the election? I appreciate your thoughts there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think it's all of the above. We do a survey with our commercial clients that says what concerns you? The
number one concern was the election.
And obviously, whether you -- Republican or Democrat wins, in many ways, it just takes some uncertainty off the
table. So, I think getting that behind us in November will be helpful. Number two, the concern that our clients have
are around the strength of the consumer.
And I think that really gets to the underlying strength of the economy. Can the consumer continue to spend? And
the consumer has been fairly resilient through this entire cycle. And if that continues, I think that will take another
concern off the table. The third is just declining margins of our clients. And I think that has to do with inflation, and
that's the residual impact of just having inflation come down to match what they can pass on to the client.
And the fourth is labor availability. So, it's amazing to me that at the end of the day, one of the things holding back
capital requests are finding the people to be able to work that new business line or support their growth. So, I
think it's going to take the election getting behind us.
Line utilization, as I said earlier, could be as much as $1 billion of growth just back to a normalized level. But we're
already seeing production levels increase. And the one thing we haven't talked about is just payoff and paydown
activities.
We've said this year, 2023 was not a normal year. When you look at our commercial portfolio each quarter, we
had about $1.3 billion of payoffs and paydowns. This year, we're averaging closer to $1.6 billion, and that's going
to remain elevated for several more quarters, especially as CRE has some more payoff activities. But that also
will return to more normalized levels.
So when you add in the fact that uncertainty goes away, production increases, we add in new talent and the
payoff activity slows, I think you'll start to see loan growth return to more normalized levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Thank you. And then, my follow up. Noninterest-bearing balances were relatively stable on a period-end basis,
but declined at a faster on average. Given the number of rate cuts projected by the forward curve into next year,
do you see those balances growing at some point in 2025? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
[ph] Tony (00:50:11), we would expect to see some growth in those balances in 2025. I mean, it's highly
uncertain. That'd be a change in trend. So, but we're optimistic that we can, through client acquisition and core
business, that we can get a tailwind there. But that's to be determined.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samuel Varga of UBS. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Jamie, I wanted to ask about the particular part of loan growth middle market, CIB and
specialty lending. Can you give us a sense for where those yields are relative to the book, just in terms of the
commercial yields? Like, are these – is this mix of growth naturally benefiting your commercial loan yields?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
When you look at those businesses and the spreads in those businesses, CIB would be on the tighter end, and
would actually be kind of tighter than our overall production. But we are seeing some tailwinds due to the spreads
in those other businesses on middle market and specialty. They change, they ebb and flow, especially in
specialty.
But in general, it's the CIB. Think about larger – lower spread, originations, strong credits and then the others, you
can generally get a little more spread.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And I'd add, Jamie, in this last quarter, when you look at our total yields on production, we're about $750 million,
$747 million. And the portfolio is about $647 million. So everything we're putting on today, although that 55 basis
points lower than what it was in the second quarter, given the rate cut, we're still seeing a going on yield that will
be accretive to the overall portfolio. It's about 100 basis points higher.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you both. That's very helpful. And then, just on the next slide on deposits, and sort of the core CD
beta that you've alluded to, the 80% that you've realized on the new production. I'm just curious if you can give
any color at this time on whether that beta is still supporting the volumes you need or is there any point where the
beta gets almost like capped because you need to bring the volume in for the deposit base to support the loan
growth on the other side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, if you look at the production levels, time production was actually higher quarter on quarter with much lower
rates of production. And so we believe that what we're doing is appropriate. We believe that it will be sufficient for
what we're looking for on the funding side.

But I would just say that we're not beholden to any product for individual liquidity purposes. If we think it's a better
idea to reduce our time deposit rates and use a brokered or home loan bank or anything like that to offset that
funding, that's easy to do because we have increased capacity of wholesale funding, which we continue to draw
down.
And so our funding story is really strong because we're in a spot where we can choose between all the different
sources of liquidity. And right now, we think that it's prudent to be fairly aggressive in the reduction of CD rates,
especially the promo rates as we go through this easing cycle.

Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hi. Good morning, everyone. I'm curious, kind of around potential operating leveraging in 2025. Do you think that
is a plausible target or do you really need to see maybe the ability for fixed rate loan repricing to create that
inflection point in the NIM to drive that? Or what might be the catalyst if you think it is plausible?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
As we look to 2025, and we will give more guidance on this later in the quarter at an industry conference. But as
we look to 2025, we believe a couple of things. We believe that expense growth will be higher than it is right now.
Obviously, we're not growing expenses. We've done a lot to drive that performance, but we do believe that
expense growth will be higher in 2025 than what we've seen recently. Really, as we lean into the opportunities
here in the Southeast, we believe that the growth opportunities in the Southeast are strong. And we believe that
we have the right to win. And so, we will lean into that here at the end of this year and as we head into 2025. And
so, expense growth will be higher.
But we believe that our goal alongside higher revenue growth. And so, we expect to see on the revenue side as
Kevin walked through in detail why we expect to see loan growth, all those different components, if you combine
just pure business growth along with line utilization increases, along with increased transaction activity, we do
expect to see strong revenue growth that goes with that.
And so, operating leverage in 2025 is possible. Obviously, the rate environment is very important. The economic
environment is very important. A lot of uncertainties as we look that far forward at the moment. But we do see
paths to that as we look into 2025.

Okay. Extremely helpful. And I know you also said, the path of noninterest-bearing deposits remains uncertain as
well. But are you seeing any kind of glimpses of things that could create a shift in terms of the pace of decline?
Because it looked like that on an end-of-period basis, that pace of decline actually didn't ramp up even a bit this

quarter. So, I'm just wondering if there's anything you're seeing that would give you some hope of near-term
stability there on those noninterest-bearing deposits.

Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
I think, Jamie and his team have been looking at the various segments of where we're seeing DDA diminishment.
I think on the positive side, we've seen the consumer average balance per account fall below $10,000, which is
kind of a low watermark. And depending on what happens with consumer, the level of diminishment could greatly
decline.
We saw a little more this past quarter in business banking versus commercial. Commercial diminishment largely
has dried up in the third quarter. So, I think the way to think about DDA to Jamie's earlier point, we're going to
produce some new level of production.
Some of that now is finding its way into interest-bearing checking. So you're not going to get the noninterest
bearing, but the biggest driver to your question is the diminishment of average balance per account.
And each quarter, we are seeing that continue to decline. When it actually hits its trough, we can't predict that. But
it appears, based on that trajectory that we're getting closer to that.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Most have been asked and answered. But just wanted
to get any sort of updates on the thought process around M&A. Last month, we saw the OCC, FDIC, and DOJ
kind of update their merger review process. And as I step back and I think about the way the industry could
consolidate over the intermediate to longer term, as I think about the Southeast and where you guys are from an
asset size perspective, you have a couple banks that have come into your markets or at least come into the
Southeast, a little bit more aggressively.
You have some of the megabanks building branches seemingly on every corner in every one of your markets. Is
there more a risk of not doing something versus doing something over the intermediate to longer term, do you
think, as it relates to kind of longer term financial targets or not? Just wanted to see if, as we think about
consolidation and what's going to happen with the industry over the intermediate to longer term, what role does
that mean for Synovus? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Michael, it's a great question. We're hearing more and more discussions around what happens if the
administration changes and does that drive more M&A activity. And you can hear from some of the other earnings
calls that others have recognized that Southeast is a pretty great place to do business.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
But in many ways our answer is unchanged. We believe that the greatest investment we can make today is in
Synovus and adding talent, continuing to add new technology, new capabilities and solutions to continue to drive
deeper wallet share with our existing clients and attract new clients.
In many ways, in the short and medium term, that sense of acquisition or the impact that would be associated with
any sort of migration or conversion would actually create greater opportunities for us to take share.
So I don't think anything's changed for us. It's no secret that the Southeast is a great place to do business. And to
your point, people are adding branches and putting LPOs and adding teams. And we're continuing to focus on
how we win market share. And we're doing that without having to buy a bank. We're adding new teams and new
talent, adding new technology.
So, the story really hasn't changed and it just really means that to win in this space, you've got to have a real
value proposition. And that's why when we look at some of these awards that we win, whether it's J.D. Power,
Greenwich, it's important for us to continue to provide a level of service and advice that is second to none, that
beats our competition. And that's, I think, the most important part, rather than trying to do an acquisition that relies
on cost reductions and revenue synergies to generate that EPS growth. We're focused on Synovus and what we
can do to take advantage of the organic opportunities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And maybe just one follow-up, just as it relates to the organic opportunity. I know you talked about, and I
know it's early for next year, but you talked about more of a normal year of loan growth. But you do have some
self maybe imposed headwinds that are abating in terms of third-party healthcare, things like that. Line utilization,
as I think you mentioned could begin to pick up once you get through the election and some of these other things.
What does a normal year kind of mean for Synovus? Historically, it's been kind of a few percentage points above
GDP growth. That correlation is kind of broken down here in recent years for, I think, obvious reasons. But kind of
what does that mean for Synovus? Maybe not just for next year, but as we think about the next couple of years.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, Michael, you said it. What we've said in the past, it's hard to give someone an absolute range to your point
based on what the underlying growth would be given by the economy. So, we've always said 100 basis points to
200 basis points above the underlying growth.
And that's just predicated on the fact that we want to provide our fair share of growth plus something in excess to
show that we're taking market share from competition. And so, if we were to return to a normal 2% to 3% GDP
growth, you would expect us to be at somewhere around 4% to 5% loan growth. And that's under a kind of normal
situation. And to your point, for a lot of the reasons that you noted and I talked about earlier, the headwinds are
largely abating and it's going to turn towards production and line utilization.
And one of the things that we've been doing over the last several years are continuing to add new arrows to our
quiver as it relates to new businesses, new specialty finance areas, new teams. We're expanding.

As I said earlier, we're starting to expand our community bank again, where we're adding talent in some of our
high growth markets. So, for all of those reasons, we still feel like we can outpace the market with loan growth
exceeding that of the underlying GDP.

Please go ahead.

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. I had a follow up on the deposit side. Jamie, I appreciate the commentary about two-
thirds of this – of the core CD book maturing five months. As you think about your posted rates and at least recent
customer behavior, is the expectation and strategy that you'll be able to keep that slug of deposits pretty short and
kind of be able to come back again second, third quarter of next year to reprice them down again?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yes. That's our base case expectation. And we will continually look at the forward curve and think about the
spreads between longer term CDs and for a shorter term. But right now, our focus is ensuring that that book
reprices as quickly as possible, but also solves what our clients are looking for. They want some stability. And
they go into that because they want multiple months of flat rates on their deposits to be able to count on. And so,
we have to be balanced in what we do. But right now, we're leaning into that five month.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Appreciate that. And then just a quick question on the office loan relationship. I appreciate the fact that
NPLs would have been down excluding that, but any color there in terms of geography, kind of the office product
type, just for some background color?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yes. Sure. Not to get too specific on the credit, but it's two different cities, two different suburban offices. One is in
the Southeast, one is not. So, that's kind of the outline of it. About equal dollar amounts, quite frankly. But
separate resolution plans working with those loans.
And again, to your point, I think if you do take out that office loan, you look at the NPL reduction overall. But if you
look specifically at our office portfolio, the criticized or rated ratio is less than 10%. Obviously, this one is a non-
accrual. So, if you back that out, you really don't have very much in the way of non-accruals.
So there is some stability in the office book. But we realize that, over time, I think you're going to continue to have
one-offs on office. We think we got a good plan on this one actually to work through our resolution.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the margin and just think about the yield to loan a little bit. Can
we first start with the fixed rate book? And is there any way to quantify just the amount of fixed rate repricing that
we may see in 2025?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hi, Catherine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
...and that's impacting the margin? Hey, Jamie.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. When we look at 2025, our outlook as far as the impact of fixed rate repricing has not materially changed
outside of the fact when -- we used to say 20 basis points, but that was before the securities repositioning.
Currently, our expectation is about 15 basis points of margin impact due to fixed rate repricing in 2025. And it'd be
the same number for 2026. So that's consistent really with what we've said before, except for the fact that we
accelerated that process with the securities repositioning earlier this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, great. And then, just as a follow up, do you have where the fixed rate book, where that current portfolio rate
is today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
The fixed rate book, well, we do. The – there are a couple of different components that I'll point to. So, if you're
working on the fixed rate repricing impact, here's what I would – how I would break it down.
Our fixed rate commercial loan book is a little less than 20% of assets. It's about 18% assets. Those rates on the
books are about 2% below current origination rates. So you have 18% of the book, 2% below what I would
consider today's market rates due to when they were originated.
On the mortgage portfolio, that's about 12% of assets, and the book yield on that is around 4%. And so you could
say that's 2% or so or below market rates on the residential mortgage portfolio.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay, great. And then on the variable rate piece, you had a really good slide in your last deck that just
broke down the kinds of components of your variable rate loan portfolio.
Can you talk a little bit about maybe the kind of the cadence of how quickly some of that's repricing, what you've
seen so far with a 50 basis point cut, and maybe what that means for loan yields as we go into the fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yes. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, when you step back from a high level, the loan beta starts with the 62% of loans
that are floating rate, and then you back out the hedges. And so, on loans you should assume, low 50s beta
through this easing cycle, and that's pretty – it'll flow through pretty cleanly.
For total asset beta, when you add in the securities portfolio, you get to kind of low to mid-40s on the asset beta of
the balance sheet. And so, that's at a high level what you'll see through the easing cycle on the asset side of the
balance sheet.
When you look at the individual components of floating rate loans, they're progressing as you would expect with
their contractual resets. So we have about $19 billion of loans that are one month SOFR. We have the $2 billion
that are a little less than $2 billion that are one-year Treasury resets.
Now, those are really the only unique structures we have on the balance sheets. Those are one-year Treasury
floating rate loans that reset monthly. And so, we've been seeing a little bit of margin pressure from those ever
since one year started to go down a few months ago.
And so, that's already been in there, and it'll continue depending on where one-year Treasuries go from here. And
then, we have $3.5 billion of prime loans. We have overnight SOFR loans, around $1 billion. And those all will
reset when the Fed actually moves.
And I will just reiterate the point that on the hedge portfolio, those are received fixed hedges pay overnight SOFR.
And so, those reset actually when the Fed moves as well. So that's a lot of detail around how our floating rate
exposure will reset as we go through the cycle.
