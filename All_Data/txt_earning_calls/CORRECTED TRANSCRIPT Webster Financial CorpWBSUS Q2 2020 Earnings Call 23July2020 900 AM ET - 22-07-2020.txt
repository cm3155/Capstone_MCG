John R. Ciulla
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining Webster's second quarter earnings call. I hope that
all of you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. CFO Glenn MacInnes and I will review business and financial
performance for the quarter. I'll provide updates on our COVID-19 related activities and line of business
performance. I'll also report on key credit metrics and trends, including our exposure to industry's most directly
impacted by the pandemic and provide an update on loan modification and payment deferral activities.
The portfolio-specific credit slides that we walked you through in Q1 have been updated for Q2 and are included
in the supplemental slides. After Glenn provides additional information on Q2 financial performance, HSA Bank
President, Chad Wilkins and Jason Soto, our Chief Credit Officer will join us for Q&A.
While we have seen a dramatic improvement in the healthcare data across our four-straight retail banking
footprint over the last month, we know that rising cases of COVID-19 continue to challenge parts of the U.S. and
that economic activity, including consumer and business demand and confidence, will continue to be muted by
the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. Glenn and I, along with the rest of the executive team, continue to
focus on prudently managing capital, credit and liquidity, considering all of the potential macroeconomic
scenarios.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Webster bankers continue to show great energy, engagement and compassion as they take care of each other,
our customers and our communities. I want to thank each and every one of them for their remarkable
contributions during this challenging time. I'm incredibly proud of the entire team.
On slide 2, you can see some examples of the way our bankers have responded over the last several months. I'm
pleased with the way our employees have adjusted through remote working environments and our organization
continues to focus on employees' safety and support. We worked tirelessly to help our consumer and business
customers through loan modifications, flexible products and pricing, and through participation in the PPP and
Main Street Lending Programs.
To-date, we have processed, approved and funded more than 10,000 PPP loans, totaling $1.4 billion for both
existing and new customers. We funded every qualified applicant that completed the loan process. Our
philanthropic activities continue to be focused on making an immediate and direct impact on those most affected
by COVID-19. And in addition and more recently in helping organizations that are poised to make a difference at
the inflection point to racial equality and economic opportunity.
I'll now turn to financial highlights on slide 3. Webster's second quarter results demonstrate our ongoing
commitment to strong execution on our strategic priorities. We feel good about our performance in the quarter,
particularly in light of the challenging operating environment.
Pre-provision net revenue of $107.9 million was down approximately 14% from Q1, driven by lower total revenue
partially offset by a decline in expenses. Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.57 or $0.61 when adjusted for
a $5.5 million valuation adjustment that Glenn will discuss in his remarks. This compares to $0.39 in Q1 and
$1.05 in the prior-year's second quarter.
Consistent with last quarter, Glenn will walk you through the assumptions underlying CECL process and resulting
provision for the quarter. Our $40 million provision results in a $23.6 million reserve build. Our second quarter
return on common equity was 6.8% and return on tangible common equity was 8.5%.
On slide 4, loan growth was solid as loans grew 13% from a year ago or 6% when excluding $1.4 billion in PPP
loans. Commercial loans grew almost 10% from a year ago or by more than $1.1 billion.
Linked quarter non-PPP commercial loan balances declined modestly, but the decline was driven almost entirely
by a reduction in line utilization. In fact, Commercial Banking non-PPP origination and payoff activity was largely
in line with the prior-year's second quarter. The decline in floating and periodic rate loans to total loans reflects
fixed rate PPP loans added in the quarter.
Deposits grew 16.6% year-over-year, driven across all business lines. Transactional and HSA deposits now
represent 62% of total deposits, up from 58% a year ago.
Slides 5 through 7 set forth key performance statistics for our three lines of business. On slide 5, in Commercial
Banking, excluding PPP loans, balances were up 9.4% from a year ago. CRE was the primary driver of year-over-
year growth.
As I mentioned earlier, loan balances in the quarter were materially impacted by lower line utilization. A significant
amount of the 1Q defensive line draws were repaid and our asset-based lending group saw a 20% reduction in
outstanding loan balances as slower economic activity reduced our customers need for receivables and inventory
support.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Deposits were up sharply in Commercial Banking due to a cash build in our clients' balance sheets. Commercial
deposits were up 12.4% linked quarter and 54% from a year ago, marking an all-time high for that line of
business. Higher loan and deposit volumes drove a 5% year-over-year increase in net interest income in
Commercial Banking, while expenses were down 3.3%. Commercial PPNR was up 9.1% compared to prior-year
due to the net interest income increase and strong expense discipline.
On slide 6, you will notice that we have modified our slide presentation slightly for HSA Bank. Our slide now
shows our core accounts and deposits as well as those associated with our TPA partners. We've done this in
order to provide more clarity regarding the decision of two TPA partners to transition accounts and balances to
their internal solutions. This is what we promised we would do when we communicated the TPA transitions to the
market late last year.
COVID-19 has had a mixed impact on the overall HSA business in Q2. Account openings were modestly lower
than prior-year due to slower hiring trends across our employer customers, while outside the TPA channel,
deposit balance growth remained strong at 11.7% year-over-year due in part to reduced consumer spending in
the period. So higher balances helped NII, while the spending declined had a negative impact on our interchange
revenue. HSA consumer spending did begin to pick up late in the quarter, a trend we see continuing as elective
medical services continue to open up across the country.
We saw a strong increase in new business opportunities late in the quarter, winning more new HSA RFPs than
we did last year, specifically in the large employer space, this is a positive early sign for 2021 in our DTE channel.
In the quarter, TPA accounts and balances declined $68,000 and $89 million, respectively representing the
beginning of the anticipated loss of accounts in that channel. As we have mentioned several times in the past, the
TPA channel has materially lower average account balances than our core accounts, due to our limited interaction
with the account holders. The accounts that left in 2Q had an average deposit balance of $1,442 per account
compared to $2,369 for our core customer accounts.
As disclosed last quarter, we are on track to close and onboard 23,000 new account holders from State Farm
Bank early in the third quarter. The related deposit balances approximate $136 million or about $5,900 per
account.
Although the pandemic had introduced some volatility into HSA Bank performance metrics, the fundamentals of
HSA Bank and the broader HSA market remained strong with ample opportunity for continued growth.
I'm now on page 7, Community Banking loans grew by 13% year-over-year and by 2% excluding PPP loans.
Mortgage originations were strong and the pipeline remains robust. LendingClub balances totaled just $163
million at June 30, down another $13 million from March 31 as that portfolio continues to be in runoff mode.
Community Banking deposits grew by 14% year-over-year with consumer and business deposits growing by 6%
and 40% respectively. Our total cost of Community Banking deposits was 38 basis points in the quarter compared
to 71 basis points a year ago.
Non-interest income was down 15%, primarily driven by lower deposit service charges resulting from higher
average balances and lower retail spend due to COVID-19. Mortgage banking and business banking swap fees
saw a meaningful year-over-year growth. Reflecting the continued shift in consumer preferences, 77% of total
transactions in the quarter were self-service and mobile banking households grew by 13% year-over-year.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Turning to the next two slides, I'll talk about credit. Our June 30 reported credit metrics remained relatively and
remarkably stable reflecting the increased level of economic stress, partially offset by the impact of government
stimulus and loan modification and deferral programs. We expect to see continued pressure on credit as our
forward forecast of economic conditions remains less favorable and we anticipate the continuation of a
challenging business environment due to the pandemic.
Overall delinquencies, classified assets, non-accrual loans and net charge-offs modestly deteriorated from prior
quarter, but remained within recent ranges. Glenn will talk specifically about these metrics in a moment.
On slide 8 with respect to commercial loans we've updated our disclosure on the sectors most directly impacted
by COVID and included updated modification information. Key takeaways are that overall exposure to these
sectors has declined. Defensive line draws in these sectors and across the commercial bank have largely been
repaid. New modification requests have slowed dramatically and the absolute number of loan modifications in
force has declined from its peak.
On slide 9, we provide more detail across our entire $20 billion commercial and consumer loan portfolio. I think
there's a lot of good information on this slide. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $2.29 billion or 11%
of our funded loan portfolio was under some sort of modification.
On May 8, when we filed our first quarter 10-Q, modified loans represented just under $2.9 billion or 14% of our
portfolio. As you can see, our modified loans have come down materially. I think it's also important to note that
almost half of the commercial loan modifications in effect at June 30, are not related to modification of payment
terms, meaning the borrower is still paying principal and interest as originally contracted. In these instances, we
provided covenant relief, borrowing base adjustments, additional liquidity or other concessions.
With respect to payment-related modifications, we have seen more than an $800 million or 38% decline in
modified loan dollars since May 8. And while it's way too early to declare victory, overall modification trending is
encouraging.
The overall portfolio weighted average risk rating has deteriorated modestly as a result of the economic stress.
However, the vast majority of our risk rating downgrades have occurred within the past rating categories. We are
actively monitoring risk. We are making real-time credit rating decisions and addressing potential credit issues
proactively.
Impact of the virus, the pace of reopening or reclosing the economy across geographies and the potential for
additional government stimulus actions will all help determine the ultimate outcome of credit performance, not
only for us, but for the rest of our industry. We continue to feel good about the quality of our underwriting, our
portfolio management capabilities and our capital position.
Finally, before I turn it over to Glenn. I'd like to comment on capital management. First, we remain completely
focused on internal execution. We have a strong capital position enabling us to continue to support our customers
and assist in the broader financial recovery.
As we announced Tuesday, our board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Given our current
economic baseline forecast, anticipated earnings and capital position we anticipate continuation of the dividend at
its current level. If conditions deteriorate significantly we will make the appropriate decisions relating to our
6

dividend as we will always ensure we can take care of our customers, our bankers, our communities and our
shareholders. And we will not repurchase our stock until the pandemic is behind us.
I'll now turn it over to Glenn for the financial review.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, John. I'll begin with our average balance sheet on slide 10. Average loans grew almost $1.3 billion or 6.3
% linked quarter. Our commercial portfolio grew by $1.4 billion, driven primarily by $940 million in PPP loans. In
the second quarter, we funded over 10,000 PPP loans. Loans had an average balance of $135,000 with a median
balance of $34,000. Over 80% of the loans were less than $150,000.
The PPP loans include around $70 million to new customers with the remainder going to the existing Webster
customer base. We expect 75% of the loans will be forgiven over the second half of 2020, but timing will depend
on final SBA guidelines and customer preferences. We believe that approximately two-thirds of the PPP funds
remained in customer deposits accounts at quarter-end.
Outside of PPP loans, commercial loans grew $458 million, C&I loans grew by $319 million, reflective of line
draws, which began late in the first quarter along with growth in public sector finance. In addition, commercial real
estate loans grew $139 million as a result of higher activity in our investor CRE and middle-market businesses.
On a year-over-year basis, commercial real estate loans have grown by more than $1 billion. The $114 million
decline in consumer loans is the result of reductions of $67 million in residential mortgages and $41 million in
home equity.
Deposits increased $1.9 billion linked quarter, reflecting substantial pandemic-related commercial and consumer
liquidity. Demand deposits represented $1.3 billion of this increase. Commercial and business banking demand
deposits grew $1.1 billion or 31%. The average consumer demand deposit increased over $1,000 per account or
13.2%, representing $161 million of growth. As a result borrowings declined by $186 million with FHLB advances
representing the majority of the reduction. Borrowings included $373 million of balances from the utilization of the
PPP liquidity facility.
Regulatory risk weighted capital ratios increased due to growth in equity and a decrease in risk weighted assets.
Risk weighted assets decreased as a result of the addition of 0% risk weighted PPP loans as well as a decline in
100% risk weighted commercial loans. The increase in asset balances impacted our tangible common equity ratio
by 27 basis points, which was more than offset by retained earnings and an increase in the net unrealized gain in
our AFS portfolio. Tangible book value per share at quarter-end was $27.40, an increase of 3.6% from March 31st
and 6.9% from prior-year.
Slide 11 summarizes our income statement and drivers of quarterly earnings. Net interest income declined $6.4
million from prior quarter. Lower rates resulted in quarter-over-quarter decline of $30 million in revenue from
earning assets; this was partially offset by $8 million due to balanced growth and $16 million due to lower deposits
and borrowing costs.
As a result, our net interest margin was 24 basis points lower quarter-over-quarter. 40 basis points was the result
of earning asset yield, partially offset by 12 basis points from lower deposit costs and 7 basis points from lower
borrowing costs. In addition, PPP loans represented another 2 basis points of the linked quarter NIM decline.
Versus prior-year net interest income declined $17.4 million; $44 million of the decline was the net result of lower
market rates with a partial offset of $29 million from earning asset growth.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Non-interest income decreased $13.3 million linked quarter and $15.8 million from prior-year. Deposit service fees
declined $6.7 million quarter-over-quarter with overdraft fees declining $3 million. HSA deposit fees decreased
$3.3 million linked quarter with interchange representing $2.4 million of the decline as a result of lower spend.
We also saw quarter-over-quarter pressure on wealth management related fees, which was partially offset by
higher mortgage banking activity. Another $5.5 million of the quarter-over-quarter reduction in non-interest income
was due to a discrete fair value adjustment on our customer hedging book. The decrease in non-interest income
from prior-year reflects the lower level of deposit service fees, the fair value adjustment with a partial offset from
higher mortgage banking revenue.
Reported non-interest expense of $177 million declined both linked quarter and from prior-year and is reflective of
continued expense discipline. Pre-provision net revenue was $108 million in Q2, this compares to $125 million in
Q1 and $137 million in prior-year. The provision for credit loss for the quarter was $40 million, which I will discuss
in more detail shortly. The efficiency ratio of 60% compares to 58% in Q1 reflecting lower quarter-over-quarter
revenue with an offset from lower expense. And our effective tax rate was 21.8% compared to 22.6% in Q1.
Turning to slide 12, I will review the results of our second quarter allowance for loan losses under CECL. As you
can see, the allowance for credit losses to loans increased to 1.64% or 1.75%, excluding PPP loans.
For the quarter net charge-offs were $16.4 million. Our loan loss provision of $40 million consisted of two
components: first a reduction of $8 million, driven by lower loan balances, primarily due to lower commercial credit
utilization at quarter-end; and second, an increase of $48 million, which is reflective of our updated economic
forecast.
The provision reflects the Moody's June economic forecast. The forecast has unemployment peaking at 14% in
Q2, declining to 9.5% in Q4, and 9.3% on average for 2021. GDP is forecasted to decline on a full-year basis by
5.6% in 2020.
Annualized year-over-year GDP growth will not turn positive until mid-2021. Key drivers for the provision or
changes in the economic forecast, risk rating migration, loan modification and deferral trends as well as the
impact of the Fed stimulus programs. The $359 million allowance reflects our best estimate of life of loan losses
as of June 30. We will continue to assess the macroeconomic environment and the impact on our credit quality as
we move through the pandemic.
In addition to our quarterly CECL process, we continue to run several stress scenarios reviewing the results with
management, the board and regulators. The results inform our thinking on future performance, liquidity and
operating capital, which remained strong and in excess of well-capitalized levels.
Slide 13 highlights our key asset quality metrics as of June 30, non-performing loans in the upper left increased
$11 million from Q1. Residential mortgage and consumer loans represented $7 million of the increase, with $4
million driven by smaller exposures in CRE and middle-market. Net charge-offs in the upper right increased from
Q1 and totaled $16.4 million in the quarter. C&I increased $10 million, primarily reflecting two restaurant chains
and our sponsor portfolio that we're experiencing difficulty prior to the onset of the pandemic. Commercial
classified loans in the lower left represented 295 basis points of total commercial loans, this compares to a 20-
quarter average of 314 basis points. The allowance for credit loss increased to $359 million as discussed on the
prior slide.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Slide 14 highlights our liquidity metrics. Our diverse deposit gathering sources continue to provide us with a
strong base for loan growth. More than $1.8 billion of deposit growth in Q2 funded more than $900 million in loan
growth and lowered the loan-to-deposit ratio to 83%.
We are predominantly core deposit funded with no brokered CDs at June 30. In addition, our sources have
secured borrowing capacity totaled $11.2 billion at June 30, the increase of almost $2.2 billion from March 31,
reflects $1 billion of unused PPP collateral at the Fed and the pay down of FHLB advances.
Slide 15 highlights our strong capital metrics. Our regulatory capital ratios exceed well-capitalized levels by
substantial amounts. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.2% exceeds well-capitalized by more than $1 billion.
Likewise, Tier 1 risk-based capital exceeds well-capitalized levels by $853 million.
With respect to our outlook, the impact of the pandemic on the economy continues to present near-term
challenges. Average earning asset growth, net interest income and NIM will be influenced by the timing and
amount of PPP forgiveness and repayment activity. Assuming market rates do not go below zero, PPNR has
modest risk to further declines in short-term rates. Non-interest income will be influenced by the pace of deposit
service fees in HSA Bank and Community Banking. We will continue to remain disciplined on our expense
management and our share count should remain relatively flat as we do not anticipate any near share
repurchases.
With that, I'll turn things back over to John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks a lot, Glenn. I'd like to provide some perspective on our longer term operating goals and execution
strategies before we open it up to questions.
As you know, our goal is to allocate capital and focus business strategies for the purpose of maximizing economic
profits over time. For 40 consecutive quarters, we were able to grow revenue period-over-period distinguishing
ourselves from our peers. The differentiated strength of our company has been deploying low cost, high growth
HSA and core consumer deposits into market leading specialized and sophisticated C&I and CRE commercial
loan growth across an expanding set of industry verticals and geographies.
Our view of the macroeconomic environment over the next several years is that rates will be lower for longer and
economic growth will be modest. As I mentioned beginning in our January earnings call, we believe we have
meaningful opportunity to change the cost structure supporting our delivery of products and services to our
customers across all business lines without limiting the effectiveness or growth or value of our differentiated
businesses.
We have been and remained focused on operational efficiencies and revenue enhancements across the
organization beginning well before the onset of the pandemic. And with the pandemic accelerating changes in
customer preferences and shifting workplace dynamics, opportunities to fully align expenses with our business
line execution only get broader. Our goal continues to be generating returns in excess of our estimated 10% cost
of capital over the medium and long-term and we'll work diligently to achieve that goal.
Donna, with that Glenn, Chad, Jason and I are prepared to take questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming
from Steve Alexopoulos of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I can start on credit. So if you look at the deferral slide, most of the trends were favorable to – but the one that
does standout is the most scrutinized is leverage lending, which saw modifications rise since May 8. Could you
give color on what you're seeing there and should we translate higher deferrals into eventual higher losses in that
bucket?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, I mean this – the big question is the translation of embedded loss from the modifications, right? We
obviously look carefully if customers need some sort of modification that shows that they've got some sort of
potential weakness.
I'll let Jason comment on some of the stuff. One of the things Steve on the leverage portfolio again is not all of the
modifications are payment-related and if you think about both in our general sponsor book and those leveraged
loans within sponsor, the things were encouraged by – we're doing a lot of modifications that are simply providing
the customer with some more flexibility with respect to covenant or liquidity or some of the other covenant-based
modifications.
And we know that we have sponsors behind the vast majority of those deals, who have significant equity in the
transactions and how are working with us really closely. So for me, I don't get alarmed that that's one of the higher
categories, you'd expect in a leverage situation that would be a company that might need a little bit more
modification and flexibility; but we're not seeing sort of systemic weakness in that portfolio at all. And Jason
maybe you want to give your perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Chief Credit Risk Officer, Webster Financial Corporation
Yeah. No, happy to join, I think you're right. If you look at the amount in the slide, 70% of it is not payment related,
right? And so the other 30% is. And if you even break down that 30% further, there is a portion of that that's just
the principal deferral, but they continue to pay interest. So ultimately, we worry a little bit less about the covenant
modification versus the payment modification.
10


Webster Financial Corp.
(WBS) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
And what I'll also tell you is that a lot of sponsors have indicated that they're willing to support these companies
even in some of the most impacted sectors, right. But they want sort of a short window to assess the situation and
environment and how quickly the borrowers will recover before they decide to cut a check and figure out what the
long-term solution is. So right now, I'm cautiously encouraged by the conversations we're having with these
sponsors and I think the right point is that a good 30% or the only 30% of them are actually payment-related.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's actually helpful. And then if we look at the slide with the updated COVID-19 exposures, can you walk
us through what reviews you've now done on those portfolios and now that you've had more time to assess the
risk there, how do you think about risk in those buckets? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Jason, do you want me to take that one directly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Chief Credit Risk Officer, Webster Financial Corporation
And so you're talking specifically about the sectors or...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Chief Credit Risk Officer, Webster Financial Corporation
...okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
The slide that calls out restaurant, hotel, leisure et cetera, all those impacted sectors.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Chief Credit Risk Officer, Webster Financial Corporation
Yeah. So the rigor review around these sectors is, I'll call it, significant all right? We have a normal course review
of problem assets. We've had separate special reviews focusing on just things like restaurants, travel, leisure,
hotel and motel. We required an escalation of decision making modifications on any deals that carry a certain risk
rating, which in the past would have been done without coming to my level. So we've been very, very proactive in
looking at all these exposures and challenging ourselves to make sure we don't have any blind spots of future
problems in these sectors.
And most of my comments are around our larger structure businesses, which carry the higher exposure, but I will
tell you that also on some of our smaller flow business, we've also taken approach on things like restaurants that,
if – over 50% of your revenue has gone as a result of the situation, we just gone straight to a downgrade, because
we can't have the same level of review and rigor on a $200,000 loan as we can on a $20 million loan. So I feel
11


Webster Financial Corp.
(WBS) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
really good about the weekly rhythm almost that we have on all these accounts and all the controls in place to
make sure that we don't have blind spots.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then if I could just maybe as Chad on HSA Bank, just a big picture question of what
you're seeing, have layoffs impacted contributions our employees that are still working still contributing like in the
past? And then we talked about employers maybe looking a full replacement, are you seeing that – how is this
environment impacting that business? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles L. Wilkins A
Executive Vice President & Head-HSA Bank, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, thanks Steve. I'd say that we haven't seen a lot of impact from the furloughs and the layoffs, so really not a
big uptick in closed accounts. We have seen the – I guess a slowdown in new accounts with existing employers.
So as employers have kind of paused on hiring as we've gone through the pandemic.
And John spoke to the slowdown in our spend levels that was – had dropped down to about 60%. We're currently
– in June, we came back to about 80% and that conversely has added a little bit of growth to – or more growth to
our deposits, as folks aren't spending as much. Contribution levels have remained about the same and that's why
we're seeing an uptick in growth on deposit. So we really haven't seen much of an impact on the contribution
levels, just really the spend levels.
As I look to the rest of the year, I think the – as the economy is still in a difficult spot. The enrollments with new
employers remained a little bit depressed. We had a dip in our pipeline as we went through March and April, but it
came back really strong in June and in July. And we've had – actually had one of our best sale seasons ever in
the large employer market, so it's looking good for one-one. It's too early to tell whether that's indicative of a – you
know some tailwinds coming in the industry as a result of the impact on the economy. So we'll see how that
unfolds as we get into 2021.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Just a follow-up first on Steve's question about HSA. So Chad are you -with July 1 being obviously a big
enrollment period, are there – are you seeing any – or any other employers – are they capable of doing it number
one? And number two are you seeing it, where they're extending the enrollment periods out by say a quarter or
so, because of just the work-at-home environment is occurring? Or is there not a lot of flexibility on some of the
way these plans are structured that they can extend that July 1 enrollment period?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles L. Wilkins A
Executive Vice President & Head-HSA Bank, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks Collyn. We have not seen any changes in the timing of enrollments and I don't anticipate seeing
any changes to the point you made. It's a little inflexible there. We thought we were seeing a pause in folks putting
their benefit packages out to bid, because they were just so distracted with everything that was going on, just
responding to the pandemic. However, that's just come back and I feel like we're ahead of last year's levels at this
point, in terms of bids and opportunities, because of everything that got pushed back a little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just in terms of potential M&A within this sector, are you guys seeing any
other opportunities coming your way similar to what you have closing with State Farm or how this current
environment maybe has impacted, portfolios and businesses that have come available for you in the HSA space?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, Collyn. I'll take a crack and then let Chad follow up. I mean, I think we remain committed to looking at
inorganic opportunities to grow this special business. So from our perspective, we're still as engaged. I will tell you
given the, sort of, you know overhang of the pandemic lower value, perceived value of deposits and growth
trajectory, I think sellers are maybe more reluctant to engage in a transaction at this time. So I would sort of say
the odds of us executing on more inorganic opportunities are lower; but our desire remains just as significant as it
was before. Chad, I don't know, if you have a perspective there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles L. Wilkins A
Executive Vice President & Head-HSA Bank, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. The only thing I'd add to that, John because I agree 100% with everything you said is that, there may be
some players in this space who are going to struggle with the lower interest rate environment as you see it sizable
decrease in the revenue that might create some opportunity; but otherwise, absolutely I agree with everything.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the expense side, if we think about this a little bit longer term, are
there – I know you guys have alluded to, maybe at some point that there's something that you might be able to do
with the Boston franchise or just – can you just kind of give us an update on how you're seeing your branch
network, just infrastructure set up now and if there's areas where you think both in the near-term and long-term,
you can look to rationalize?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. Collyn, I was pretty purposeful in my final comments there, we've been working across the entire
organization on things like automation, on looking at whether or not our entire infrastructure and expense base is
fully aligned with kind of our narrow-targeted growth opportunities in businesses. And obviously our physical
footprint both office space and banking centers is something that we review as we talk about all the time.
And I do think that coming out of this pandemic, it's really put a highlight on the fact that consumer preferences
are changing and we can deliver more effectively digitally and there's less reliance on the banking centers. So I
do think, you'll expect to see us along with a lot of other players in the industry be a little bit more aggressive at
reducing square footage, making sure that we still can deliver our products and services to our customers. And
what I'd say to follow-up on my prepared remarks earlier is that you know we'll be able to quantify that a little bit
more as we head into the third and fourth quarter for the market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly – just on the loan activity in the quarter and if you covered this in some of
the initial comments, I apologize, I missed it; but just the declines that you saw on loan balances and maybe what
your expectation is for activity in the back half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure. I mean it was a really interesting quarter actually, we on-boarded some great new customers. One of
the strengths and it's fortunate in terms of the people how we reflected risk. One of the strengths in that sponsor
business is that our largest concentration is around technology, infrastructure, data centers, fiber those kind of
transactions, which are just actually benefiting from the marketplace. So we've continued onboard some really
good credits.
One of my comments I did make earlier is that the non-PPP reduction in commercial balances was entirely driven
by line utilization. So repayment of defensive line draws along with a probably the biggest reduction I've ever seen
or contraction in ABL utilization, given what's just going on with working capital.
The actual stated numbers of originated dollars and payoffs were almost exactly in line in Commercial Banking
with a year ago second quarter, which is kind of remarkable when you think about the economic slowdown.
So, I think, going forward, now that we've kind of balanced out the utilization, you'll continue to see modest loan
growth from us. Obviously the economic environment impacts it, but we have a decent pipeline as we head into
the third quarter and we're open for business, understanding that our underwriting criteria changes a bit with the
overhang of the pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q

Okay. That's great. I will leave it there. Thanks.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Fitzgibbon of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Good morning, Mark. Great to hear from you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Likewise. John, given the differences between states on the COVID shutdowns, I'm curious, are the credit
dynamics for business customers markedly different sort of across your footprint and could you maybe give us
some color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's a great question. I don't think there's sort of a systemic or kind of repeatable underwriting change as
we go throughout our footprint. I do think, interesting dynamics even with what's been happening lately, we've
been seeing boosted real estate prices in Fairfield and Westchester, because people are leaving the city.
So, what I'd say, Mark is, I think that when we're underwriting transactions, if you think about small businesses,
which is more volume-driven, I think we're looking out systemically for industries that may be more vulnerable to
this economic landscape and the pandemic and some of the shifts in geography.
As we get into the commercial bank underwriting, which really credit-by-credit-by-credit, I think we certainly take
into consideration the dynamics in the geographies. So what you've seen in our branch footprint for
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York and Connecticut is, a consistent sort of slow March to reopening and a
little bit more activity and so we're seeing a little bit more loan activity. I don't think there's a differentiation
between those four states. I think those four states are doing pretty well. There are areas, our national restaurant
franchise business, we are not originating there now. There's just too much variability and there's just too much
uncertainty as it relates to specific geographical challenges.
So I can't really give you any trends, we haven't seen it in credit performance, in delinquencies, in consumer. We
haven't had sort of hotspots and I hate to use that phrase, because particularly the situation – but we haven't seen
kind of hotspots of poor credit performance in commercial or business banking based on geography. It's more
sector-driven.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Jason Soto A
Chief Credit Risk Officer, Webster Financial Corporation
What I would say, if you're looking at our modification book and you look at those customers that are asking for
second round accommodations, if you will. Within our business banking portfolio, we've had well over – over $100
million mature of the initial $350 million or so and only $50 million of that has actually asked for a second round
deferral.
And so I take that as cautious encouragement within our footprint. And what we're hearing from borrowers are,
look we're not quite sure how things are going to play out, but we've got some good liquidity and so we're
comfortable resuming payments at this point. So take up what it's worth, but I do view that as a slight indication of
some part of the positive trend.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up for Chad. Chad, I was curious, if you think, you still have room to push
HSA deposit costs down even further or are we sort of bottoming out here at 15 basis points?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles L. Wilkins A
Executive Vice President & Head-HSA Bank, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think that we've seen some more movement in the market. We're paying really close attention to what's
going on across our competitors and I think we have room to move still.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So Mark, it's Glenn, if I could add – just add to that, so sort of 15 basis points for the quarter, but that's reflective
of changes mid-quarter. So, you get a full quarter of that going into third quarter or probably be closer to 13 –
between 13 – around 13 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then Glenn, I know you're not giving guidance; but I wondered if you could help us think about some of
the major moving parts on operating expenses in 3Q? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So, John sort of touched on operating expenses. I would think, all things considered, you would think it would
probably be in [ph] 176 to 178 (00:44:20) range, somewhere around there, excluding any significant investments
that we make.
And then just going forward, obviously – I was – if you think about guidance going forward, a lot of it is predicated
on the PPP forgiveness and our thoughts on that. I indicated 75% by the year-end, but you know it's anyone's
guess, if 20% comes in the third quarter or 25%.

David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi, thanks. Good morning. Couple of questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
So starting on credit. Commercial real estate, I see have 9% of it is shopping center and retail. Can you talk about
how you're feeling about this portfolio and modification activity or deferral activity there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. I'll give a quick overview and then let Jason drive on some points. I've always said, when asked about the
commercial real estate portfolio that we've been a sort of low risk, low return business, Bill Wrang that runs that
business, I always mention his name on the earnings calls, because I think we deal with top-notch sponsors and
we have a very much of an institutional book.
My view is, I feel comfortable, given the debt service coverage ratios, the sponsors and the LTVs where we are
now. But I would acknowledge as CEO, one of the long-term concerns I have is what happens with some of the
commercial real estate sectors over time with changing work dynamics, with changing retail dynamics.
And so I really like where we are now both from a property-type distribution and from an underwriting distribution
and sponsor support perspective. But I think if anything, I mentioned earlier, you kind of have to wait and see how
credit plays out with all of these macro variables. I think commercial real estate is going to be the last one to kind
of figure out what happens there, just given some of maybe the long-term shifts. Jason maybe you want to
address that questions more specifically?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Chief Credit Risk Officer, Webster Financial Corporation
Yeah. No, happy to John. And you've mentioned sort of the ratios and the metrics overall in that book within
commercial real estate, where we have a lot of weighted average, the 60% loan to value [ph] and there are sort of
17 (00:46:42) debt service coverage going into the environment, obviously that'll see some impact.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
I think the more important thing is 72% of our commercial real estate portfolio is non-discretionary versus
discretionary anchored by pharmacy and retail. And so we've seen a real difference in terms of rent collection
rates in those sectors. And so far we've provided relatively modest accommodations on that portfolio six loans
about $70 million in exposure. So again, I'm never going to claim on this call that we're out of the woods on
anything, just given the environment. So far, our performance in that book has been relatively strong.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks for that. And sticking with credit, it was good to see the provision down in the second quarter
versus the first quarter. How should we think about provision for the second half of the year, given all the
uncertainty?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles L. Wilkins A
Executive Vice President & Head-HSA Bank, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So I think with respect to CECL, you nailed that, I mean there is a significant amount of uncertainty at this
point. And so we just continue – we'll update our models, we'll continue to look at the macroeconomic factors, risk
ratings, loan modification trends as well as, you know as we get further clarity on the impact of stimulus on the
portfolio. So I think, it's sort of hard to – it's hard to give a number going forward, but we'll continue to monitor that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Dave, I mean, it's interesting, right? To simplify it as much as you can, if the forward economic forecast
deteriorates that leads to higher provision. Risk rating trends within your portfolio, depending on which way they
go impact it. And then other sort of more qualitative borrower behaviors like modifications and other things kind of
factor in. And so, those are the variables – the high level variables. And then, of course, so in government
stimulus and other customer behaviors and that's where we go. So this was a pretty simple one, as Glenn went
through, we had a reduction in our forward outlook. We had some good news on modification activity and we had
some slight downtick in our risk rating and we ended up where we are here. And so those are the things that will
give you some directional sense as to where we might be going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for that. And then on the net interest margin and clearly there's going to be a lot of noise in the
near-term you mentioned about the uncertainty around when the PPP loans are forgiven. But if we were to fast
forward to say, the second quarter of 2021 or the third quarter of 2021, if we were to assume interest rates are
flat, remaining very low here. Do you have a sense as to where the net interest margin could be...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. Within a range. I mean, I think, if you look at one-month LIBOR, we pushed that out at basically 18 basis
points Fed funds to 25 basis points and maybe a slight increase in the tenure. And you can look at the impact of
that in our slides, whether you think that rate is going to come down. But if I do all that and I look at our asset
growth, I think, you'd be modestly below where we are today and that's – and you pretty much bottom out at that
point. But you're right about PPP, I think over the next two quarters that will create a lot of noise within NIM as
well as net interest income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
And just one quick one on HSA, you mentioned about how the pipeline for RFPs heading into the 2021 season is
picking up for June and July. Do you have a sense as to how that compares to the pipeline a year-ago?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Chad, do you want to take that one?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles L. Wilkins A
Executive Vice President & Head-HSA Bank, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, absolutely. I'd make two comments on that. One is the pipeline is up modestly year-over-year and we
started out much stronger, it died down for a couple of months and then snap back, right back to actually above
prior levels, so little bit above last year, it's the win rate that's really up significantly year-over-year in the large
employer space, because we're in the large employer selling season right now, which has been delayed a little bit
as well.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just I guess, circling back to the provision, the allowance and it looks like the Moody's model for July deteriorated
just a little bit incrementally versus June. But if we assume that broadly, the economic model doesn't change
much and you start seeing actual loan level losses. Do you think that the current allowance is enough to cover
that? Or do you be inclined to continue to provide for incremental losses, sort of given the broader continued
uncertainty around the economy?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, I mean, right now, Jared, it's Glenn. We think, the $350 million we have right now is adequate and is
reflective of loss content in our book. And it is – as John just pointed out on the last question, I mean, it is a matter
of looking at risk ratings, loan modifications and the macroeconomic forecast and then on top of that the stimulus.
But a bigger part of this is looking at the duration of the pandemic and the impact to our customer, whether it's a
retail customer or a commercial customer, their liquidity profile, so that's something that sort of hard to give you a
number, but I think where we are at the end of the second quarter is reflective of what we see right now.
And so, if Moody's stays about where it is, then you have to look internally and you have to look at your risk rating
migration, you have to look at liquidity on the customer bases and then modification trends. So those are the other
factors that we'd look at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then, I guess, keeping with that, I guess, how were the trends in internal credit migration
during the quarter? And are all the modified loans automatically downgraded or put on watch lists or how are you
looking, I guess, internally at dealing with those credits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I'll let Jason take the second one, Jared. I mentioned earlier, just with respect to internal risk rating migration that
our weighted average risk rating deteriorated modestly in the quarter, but the interesting dynamic there was the
vast majority and I mean, almost all of it occurred within pass-rating categories. And so if you think about that, if
we're accurately risk rating which we think we do and our regulators think we do, those are pass-graded credits
that we would underwrite even at their slightly deteriorated level.
So that has an impact on pushing the provision slightly higher; but as we said, it wasn't a material shift, because
there wasn't a big inflow into criticized and classified assets. And the reason I mentioned it proactively in my
remarks is, I also want the market to understand that we're not punting forward or kicking the can on risk
identification and risk rating. So, we know we're looking at our credits when information is provided to us and
we're talking to all of our big commercial customers and we're making the appropriate assessments on a daily
basis, where we can get information and we take those circumstances and make the right call. Jason, do you
want to talk specifically about what modification means with respect to risk rating?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Yeah. No, I'll just talk a little bit about our overall approach, right? So it's not an automatic downgrade if somebody
is being modified, it certainly depends on a number of factors whether it's a payment modification, whether it's a
temporary covenant modification, bridge to a broader solution, as I mentioned before, right?
And our approach is really, of course, more forward-looking than just looking at historical metrics, given the
current environment. We're specifically assessing whether the borrower has adequate liquidity to make it through
this environment until revenue returns to reasonable level. And as we know, overall liquidity has been enhanced
by PPP deferrals. And in some industries, advanced payments and grants like in healthcare.
In our larger structure businesses, where you're having a lot of these conversations on meaningful risk ratings,
we're getting cash flow projections that will really help influence our decision on ratings. And we're actively
tracking the true liquidity on a weekly basis versus what the companies were projecting and the revenue
associated with that.
In some of our smaller businesses, we're downgrading by sector. So, we'll continue to address and adjust our
ratings as we get more borrower-specific information and obviously, within the context of the overall economic
environment. But, it's not an automatic downgrade, just because they've asked for a deferral.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's a great color. Thanks. And then just finally for me, Glenn, you mentioned PPP forgiveness assumed
to be 75% in 2020, what's your total assumption for forgiveness out of the whole portfolio – I'm sorry, over the life
of the portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I think we go all the way through probably the end of the first quarter of 2022, so it drops down. If you think about
it this way, Jared, say 20%, 25% in Q3; and 50%, 55% in Q4. So, that's 75% of a write-down and most of it sort of
just trends down throughout 2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, like – so assume like a 90% total forgiveness level for the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A

Steven Duong Q

Hey, most of my questions have been answered, so just a high-level general question, the Moody's economic
forecast that you guys look at, how do you – in your experience, how does that compare to what you guys went
through during the financial crisis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
It's hard to handicap, it's a different form of economy and that you have the sharp – real sharp GDP. So you go
from negative GDP in Q1 to minus 33%. And likewise unemployment. And so it's sort of very steep and then a
snapback in some respect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
That's exactly right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I think it's interesting, because obviously the banking – the industry as a whole is doing a lot more stress testing
and has a lot more capabilities to forecast now than when we went through this during The Great Recession.
But what's interesting is, I think, Glenn hit the nail on the head, we're dealing with something here that's difficult,
because there's a big exigent shock right away and then there's a lot of uncertainty about the path of the
recovery, whereas the financial crisis just had a longer duration and it was kind of cumulative losses over time
and so I think that's what I would say is that, it's a different shape of economic forecast with a lot more uncertainty
going forward as to the shape of the recovery.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
And Steven, I just – look if you look at our worst performing four quarters in – during the financial crisis in 2009
and I think our lost content was like 167 basis points. So that's just four quarters. I mean, I think this is a reference
point.

Right, right. I guess like you know the snapback the Moody's is forecasting, I guess, we're experiencing such
dramatic numbers going like 40% drop and then the 50% bounce off that lower base. Do you ever – you guys
think that the absolute level of economic activity matters at all, when we're talking about such gigantic numbers,
but GDP level is it – does that matter into how businesses are running and how they perform going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
You're asking great philosophical questions. I actually think and I'll give you my editorial, right? I think that all of
the – that the whole CECL framework is a reasonable model framework, but I think what you're getting at – and
our belief is, there's a bit of a disconnect right now between the direct correlation on things like unemployment,
GDP shock, it's not immediately correlated.
And so what you have is, we need to wait and see, because particularly with the government stimulus coming in
and sort of muting a lot of the impacts, I don't think that when you look at GDP or you look at the unemployment
posted number, that it's really reflective of what we're going to see with respect to consumer credit behaviors or
what's going – whether a small business is going to make a decision. So if that's where you're going, I think we
need to wait and see how predictive some of these variables are going forward, particularly with the bounce back
and the huge GDP decline in 2Q.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
And Steven I would just add, I mean, it is going to be, as we said a few times now, it's more duration. And so you
look at our numbers and you look at the PPP loans as a percent of total loans and it's pretty significant. So even
under that modification numbers that we talked about payment modification is a significant number of PPP loans.
If you look at our consumers and their average DDA accounts is up $1,000, 13%. So they're feeling pretty good.
Our overdrafts are down, right the 20-plus-percent...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A

...quarter-over-quarter. So that can't – we know that can't last forever, but it's a matter of looking out on duration
and saying, how strong is the liquidity profile of our clients and can they see their way through the other side of
this and so that's what we're focused on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
And again just an editorial, if you're a management team – if you're our management team, you're less focused on
whether all of there – were all of these variables are accurately correlated to performance and what the shape of
the curve is. You're just looking at all of the potential outcomes and the duration and making sure you're making
smart decisions that will help you under a wide variety of potential economic outcomes.

Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Matt. How are you today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good. Just couple of quick ones. So, it seems like there's a mixed view from the industry on how long deferrals
could extend. And the idea of a long-term deferrals emerged as it becomes apparent, there are parts of – there
are businesses and parts of the economy that could be impacted going to 2021. Do you think you have this type
of flexibility? And then practically speaking will you exercise it? Or should we expect after 180 days of deferral...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Matt, you cut out a little bit there. I think we got the gist of the question and I'll give you a quick thought and then
hand it over to Jason. We were actually talking about this yesterday internally. So, I think there's kind of a natural
cadence, given where we are, given the fact that people still view fundamentally that this is a temporary disruption
that you'll have your original modifications. Jason gave you some indication that we're surprised pleasantly that
there's a lower number of people who are on modification asking for a second modification, but we're still under
the CARES Act. We're still in a place we want to help our customers.
We were talking about what would happen if we sort of get into what we would call kind of the third wave of
modifications. And I think our view institutionally is that we really have to take a strong look to your point at what
the underlying fundamental strength of the businesses are over the long-term before we just blindly grant a third
wave modification.
So, I think what you'll see in the industry is after the first 90 days or second 90 days or 60 days or 60 days,
however they're done, under the CARES Act protection, non-TDR modifications, I think not just because of the
way we have to account for them, but also because we really want to look and see whether or not some of these
businesses are permanently impaired or impacted. I think you won't see sort of just continued modification after
modification as we go into kind of a third wave, if you will. Anything to add on that, Jason?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Jason Soto A
Chief Credit Risk Officer, Webster Financial Corporation
Yeah. I think the only thing I would add is, if there's probably going to be a bifurcation between the types of
business, types of products, right? I mean, if you're talking consumer, small business going to third wave, we
have to start thinking about, all right, is this permanently impaired? Or should we be talking sort of loss mitigation
type stuff at that point, whereas I sort of just take on the commercial side and sponsor, right? You may have a
situation where we granted an additional waiver, the sponsor in the second amendment agreed to put in a few
million dollars, because the lion's share of the revenue that they were expecting in the second half of year is gone.
Take a company that puts on events and conferences, that's just not going to happen this year, right?
And so, they put a temporary band-aid on, but we all know that in early 2021, when they have their slate of events
laid out, there may be a third round, which is a broader solution with some equity, maybe some incremental
deferrals on payments and that's just the way it works more on the structured larger deals. So, I think, the answer
is different depending on what business you're talking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. So, practically speaking, you have the option to carry deferrals well into 2021, but case by case as to
whether you'll exercise it or move it to NPA.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I think that's well said.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then, just a real quick one, what was the PPP contribution to net interest income this quarter or what
was the all-in PPP yield this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So, the all-in – the contribution was somewhere around $6 million and the all-in yield is probably around $272
million. And you got to be careful with that, because that's not a full quarter yield, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. What would it be on a full quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So it's probably closer to like a – so if you think about this, if you think about – I said our average balance of a
PPP loan is about $135,000, the all-in yields would be about $350 million, funding cost about $35 million, so you'd
be around $350 million.
