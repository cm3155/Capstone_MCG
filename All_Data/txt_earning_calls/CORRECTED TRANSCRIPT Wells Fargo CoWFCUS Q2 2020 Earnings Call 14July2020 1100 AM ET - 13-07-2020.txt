Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf;
and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being
recorded.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly

Charles William Scharf
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Good morning, everyone. Thank you, John. I'm going to open the call by reviewing what is clearly a very poor
quarter for us, I'll review the drivers of our results, make some comments about the environment, and discuss the
rationale for the intended dividend reduction. I'll then turn the call over to John to review second quarter results in
more detail.
Our view of the length and severity of the downturn deteriorated considerably from our assumptions at the end of
the first quarter, and this as well as the knock-on impacts from COVID substantially impacted our results this
quarter. We added $8.4 billion to the allowance for credit losses. Charge-offs increased $204 million from the prior
quarter to $1.1 billion. Net interest income was down 13% from the prior quarter driven primarily by lower rates.
The constraints of operating under the asset cap has limited our ability to offset lower rates with balance sheet
growth, and we actually took actions during the quarter to limit loan and deposit growth, which John will highlight.
Expenses included approximately $400 million related to decisions we made due to COVID, most of which we do
not expect to be permanent, but was the right thing to do for employees and to improve the safety of our facilities.
About $350 million of deferred comp with an offset in fee revenue, $1.2 billion of operating losses primarily for

customer remediation accruals related to our ongoing work to remediate the historical issues in Community
Banking as we took another look under new leadership at outstanding matters. This accrual will enable us to do
the right thing for our customers while resolving these matters as quickly as possible.
Revenues were lower by about $295 million due to COVID-related fee and interest waivers for certain products. In
addition, a strong quarter of mortgage production revenue was partially offset by a $531 million write-down of our
mortgage servicing rights asset due to higher projected defaults and faster prepayment assumptions, and while
it's a smaller part of the company, we did had record revenues this quarter in our Corporate and Investment Bank.
Even with the loss this quarter, our CET1 ratio increased to 10.9% from 10.7% last quarter and is well above our
regulatory minimum of 9%. As a reminder, our regulatory minimum reflects our expected stress capital buffer of
2.5%, the minimum possible.
As you know, Wells Fargo is predominantly a US bank that takes deposits and makes loans. Our balance sheet
composition is 80% cash, loans and our investment portfolio. When consumers, small businesses, middle-market
companies and corporates suffer, we do as well. As the economic environment brought on by COVID negatively
impacts our customers and clients, it will filter through to our results primarily in the form of outsized credit losses
and compressed net interest margins. Additionally, given we operate with a balance sheet cap, we must prioritize
balance sheet capacity, both assets and deposits, and there's certainly an opportunity cost for us in an
environment like this. In addition, given the uncertainty of the recovery, we must manage the balance sheet to a
level where we can remain below the asset cap even if there's another period of material loan drawdowns or
upward pressure on our deposit base.
Having said that, we are responsible for the position we're in. The balance sheet cap exists because leadership
failed to both oversee and build the appropriate infrastructure of the company and our financial underperformance
is because leadership didn't make the difficult decisions necessary. We are focused on both of these. We still
have much to do to build the right risk and control foundation, which is what our regulators expect, and nothing
can or will stand in the way of those activities. It is our highest priority. But we also recognize that we've been
extremely inefficient for too long and we will begin to take decisive actions, none of which will impact our risk and
regulatory work, to increase our margins.
So, the first point, we continue to make meaningful changes to improve the foundation of the company. In the
second quarter, we announced Corporate Risk organizational structure to provide greater oversight of all risk-
taking activities and a more comprehensive view of risk across the company. Our new risk model will have five
line-of-business Chief Risk Officers to complement the teams and leaders by risk type. During the quarter, we
hired a new Chief Operational Risk Officer, a new Chief Risk Officer for Consumer Lending, and a Chief Control
Executive. We continued to add additional talent to the senior leadership team. Since I joined the company nine
months ago, I've announced six new members to the Operating Committee, all coming from outside of Wells
Fargo with strong and relevant industry experience.
Over two-thirds of our Operating Committee have joined Wells Fargo since 2018, all of our business lines CEOs
are now in place, including Mike Weinbach, who joined Wells Fargo in May as CEO of Consumer Lending; and
Barry Sommers, who joined at the end of June as CEO of Wealth and Investment Management. Lester Owens
will be joining us next week in a newly-created role as Head of Operations. Lester has more than 30 years of
experience in the financial services industry in senior operations roles. He will be responsible for building more
integrated approach to Wells Fargo's business operations functions. He has a proven track record in delivering a
better customer experience while driving substantial efficiencies at the same time.

We also made significant hires and roles one down from our Operating Committee, including a new Head of
Government Relations, Corporate Communications and Corporate Responsibility, as well as Chief Administrative
Officer, and a new Head of our Home Lending businesses. We continue to have over 200,000 employees working
from home and we plan to have employees who are currently working from home continue to do so until at least
September. It is too early to determine exactly when we will ultimately return to a more traditional work
environment, but we will be cautious about bringing people back into the office. While I do believe there are
meaningful benefits of people working physically together, we will move forward when we're comfortable that the
health risks are manageable.
Where there is a specific need, we will do so with the appropriate safety precautions in place and we will make
these decisions by geography by facility. We've done this since the beginning of the crisis and we will continue to
do so and serve our customers and communities. We've made significant accommodations for our customers.
Through the end of June, we have helped more than 2.7 million Consumer and Small Business customers by
deferring payments and waiving fees. This includes over $2.5 million of payment deferrals, representing more
than $5 billion in principal and interest, including $3.2 billion in mortgage loans serviced for others. We provided
approximately 6 million fee waivers for Consumer and Small Business customers exceeding $200 million.
For our commercial clients, we processed approximately 246,000 deferrals, representing more than $1.5 billion of
principal and interest payments. In addition, for commercial distribution and auto finance customers, we provided
maturity date extensions, representing approximately $6.6 billion of outstanding principal and interest. Through
the end of June, we have funded 179,000 PPP loans totaling $10.1 billion, with an average loan size of $56,000,
60% of those were for loan amounts of less than $25,000; 84% of those were for companies that had fewer than
10 employees; 90% have less than $2 million in annual revenues; and 41% were to companies in low- and
moderate-income areas or at least 50% minority census tracks, and we announced last week our Open for
Business Fund.
We have committed to donating approximately $400 million in gross processing fees earned from the Payroll
Protection Plan to help support businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and we will work with nonprofit
organizations to provide capital, technical support, and long-term resiliency programs to small businesses with an
emphasis on serving minority-owned businesses. Customer deposits have continued to increase, reflecting
unprecedented government stimulus programs, lower spending, and customers converting investments into cash,
while commercial deposits declined reflecting actions we took to manage under the asset cap, which John will
describe in more detail.
In March, our commercial customers utilized over $80 billion of their loan commitments during the market
turbulence, at the onset of the pandemic, and almost all of those loans were paid down in the second quarter.
Debit card spend started to increase in April and returned to pre-COVID levels in May, and in the last full week of
June were up approximately 10% from the same week a year ago. Consumer credit card spend improved steadily
starting in mid-April, but was still down approximately 10% from a year ago as of the end of June.
Commercial card spend remained significantly lower throughout the second quarter and was still down over 30%
in the last full week of June compared to the same week a year ago with declines across industry segments. We
continue to monitor our consumer and commercial customer spending trends as the nation goes through the
various stages of reopening. Trends in digital usage are strong. Mobile deposit dollar volume was up over 100%
in the second quarter compared with a year ago. In the second quarter, digital logins were up 21% from a year
ago.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
Let me turn to the dividend now. Today, we announced that our board expects to reduce our dividend for the third
quarter to $0.10 per share. The Federal Reserve has authorized banks to pay common stock dividends that do
not exceed an amount equal to the average of the bank's net income for the four preceding calendar quarters.
Based on these instructions, we previously announced that this limitation would cause us to reduce the dividend
from the current level of $0.51 a share. In addition, while this requirement currently applies to the third quarter, the
Federal Reserve stated it reserves the right to extend the limitations as it learns more about the evolution of the
COVID event.
Separately from this, our board has been reviewing the level of the dividend and I've discussed the way in which
we would approach evaluating the right go-forward level. We first would look at our capital position. As I said, our
capital position remains quite strong, so our current capital level is not the driving factor in our decision, having
said that, as we look forward, we do not pretend to have a deeper understanding of the path of the recovery than
others. Using our economic assumptions, our capital levels remain above the minimum required and our CCAR
results confirm the strength of our capital position, but we believe it's prudent to note that our assumptions are just
that. So, we felt it was appropriate to factor this uncertainty into our thinking around the appropriate dividend level
in this environment.
After evaluating our capital position, we considered our current and expected earnings level. We expect the
impact of COVID to continue to negatively impact our earnings until we see a clear trend of meaningful
improvements in unemployment and GDP. This will result in continued lower levels of NII and certain
economically sensitive fee revenues, as well as potentially unforeseen expenses to operate in this environment.
In addition, while our ACL is intended to cover expected losses based on our current economic assumptions,
we're mindful of the uncertainty and the need to reevaluate these assumptions continually. And I'll discuss this
more, but while we have actively begun to address the fact that our expenses are significantly too high, it will take
some time to see the impact of our actions in our results.
Putting this all together, it is critical in these uncertain times that our common stock dividend reflects current
earnings capacity, assuming a continued difficult operating environment, evolving regulatory guidance, and
protects our capital position if economic conditions were to further deteriorate. Given this, we believe it's prudent
to be extremely cautious until we see a clear path to broad economic improvement. We're confident that this
eventual economic improvement combined with our actions to increase our margins will allow our wonderful
franchise to support a higher dividend in the future. We're extremely disappointed to take this action and do
understand that many rely on this stream of income, however, we must be prudent in this environment.
I have acknowledged in the past that our expenses are too high and that we're building roadmaps to improve our
efficiency ratio. To repeat, there is nothing structurally different about Wells Fargo that should prevent us from
being as efficient as our large peers, but we are far from it. For us to bring our level of efficiency close to our
peers, the math would tell you we need to eliminate over $10 billion of expenses. While our work is not yet
complete to commit to specific numbers and time frames, we expect to take a series of actions beginning in the
second half of the year to begin to reduce our expense base and bring our expenses in line with the size and
composition of our businesses. This will be a multiyear effort for sure, but we'd like to see a reduction in expenses
next year.
And now, we now have a centralized team driving the effort across the enterprise, and our lines of business and
functional areas have dedicated resources stacked against this. This work did not start in the last few months, but
the extremely challenging operating environment and uncertain outlook has accelerated our sense of urgency. It
is important to note that I deeply believe that this exercise is about making us a better and more efficient
company, not just about reducing expenses. We have too many management layers, spans of controls for
6

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
managers are too narrow, and we have resources dedicated to activities that are not a priority today. This cannot
continue.
We also have the opportunity to apply lessons we have learned since the onset of the pandemic to drive
efficiency across the company. Over the medium-term, we have the opportunity to materially reduce our expense,
including increasing digital adoption for retail and commercial clients, reducing third-party spend, consolidating
locations including branches, field offices and corporate sites, and applying technology differently. In addition, the
opportunity to consolidate our operational platforms is still meaningful. As a financial company and specifically a
G-SIB, we must be strong financially to serve our customers and support our communities, but also to provide
growing opportunities for our employees, and while our balance sheet is strong, our margins are too narrow. To
ensure we're that source of strength, we need to begin to take action to improve our results.
As I've said and I'll say it again, we will not do anything that will impact the work we have underway to build out
our risk and control environment. The opportunity to become more efficient exists elsewhere in the organization
and we will protect this work at all costs. I'll continue to share more specifics about our plans as they develop and
we will be talking more about this next quarter. While there remains much economic uncertainty, many market
liquidity trends are strong as Fed programs continue to effectively support the smooth functioning of the capital
markets.
While still wide to pre-crisis levels, market spreads have continued to improve since the peak of the dislocation
and have retraced 70% to 90% of their mid-March widening. Liquidity in Treasury and interest rate swap markets
returned to pre-crisis levels and the Fed's open market purchase program has stabilized mortgage basis
valuations and improved liquidity. HQLA bid/ask measure of the cost to transfer risk has retraced to pre-crisis
levels, while measures of volatility are now below pre-crisis levels, however, the economic recovery will not be
smooth.
Much of the economy is still essentially closed or just beginning to open, and additional restrictions are being
implemented as the spread of the virus continues to increase in many areas of the world. While consumer
spending has increased from levels at the end of the first quarter, it is still down from a year ago with significant
declines in areas like travel, entertainment, and restaurants. And while government stimulus programs provided a
safety net for many, they are scheduled to run-off, raising the possibility of more economic hardship ahead.
Having said all of this, cities, communities, people and businesses are all learning what it takes to reopen safely
and there is progress on vaccines and therapeutics. We will do what we can to support the fastest recovery
possible, but we'll be cautious in our outlook until we see the facts.
I want to conclude my comments today by discussing an important topic, racial injustice. In my conversations with
different groups over the past months, the pain and frustration with the lack of progress within both our country
and Wells Fargo is clear. Inequality and discrimination has been clearly exposed and must not continue. Wells
Fargo has not been effective in creating enough diversity or consistently inclusive environment, and I've outlined a
number of actions we are taking around race to change the outcomes, including creating a new role [audio gap]
(00:19:26) which will have a broad mandate of driving diversity, inclusion in both the workplace, but also our
business. We'll be evaluating Operating Committee Members based upon their progress in improving diverse
representation inclusion in their area of responsibility and it will have a direct impact on year-end competition
decisions, and we've announced the donation of these gross processing fees for PPP estimated to be
approximately $400 million.
This is just the beginning of the work needed to address this crisis and to meaningfully contribute to the change
that is necessary. But I believe that this is a watershed moment and we will be part of making sure this time is

different. Finally, I want to thank all of the employees at Wells Fargo who continue to work tirelessly to serve our
customers and successfully execute on our priorities.
I will now turn the call over to John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Charlie's comments covered most of the information on page 2 of
the supplement, including the largest driver of our reported loss, which was the $8.4 billion increase in the
allowance for credit losses in the second quarter. So, let me highlight just a couple things here.
First, our income taxes in the second quarter reflected the impact of annual income tax benefits, primarily tax
credits, driven by our reported pre-tax loss. As a result, we currently expect our effective income tax rate for the
remainder of the year to be approximately 26% excluding the impact of any discrete items. Also, deferred
compensation plan investment results increased net gains from equity securities by $346 million and increased
personnel expense by $349 million.
As we've highlighted many times, while these hedges are largely P&L-neutral, they can result in large swings in
our reported revenue and expense trends. In late-May, we entered into arrangements to transition these
economic hedges from equity securities to derivatives in the form of total return swaps. As a result of this change,
starting in the third quarter, our reporting for this item will be less volatile since most of the accounting impact from
deferred comp hedges will be reported in personnel expense.
Turning to page 3, Charlie covered the support we're providing to our customers and communities during the
pandemic, but let me just highlight that the approximately $400 million donation for small business recovery
efforts we announced last week through the new Open for Business Fund will be donated when the gross fees
are recognized in revenue.
Turning to page 4, while our earnings in the second quarter were significantly impacted by the economic
environment, our capital and liquidity continued to be strong with both our CET1 ratio and LCR increasing from
the first quarter. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.9%, 190 basis points above our current regulatory minimum of
9%. We expect our stress capital buffer to be 2.5%, which is the lowest possible under the new framework and
would result in the regulatory minimum for our CET1 ratio remaining at 9%. Even with the large increases in our
allowances over the past two quarters, our CET1 level was $23.7 billion above the regulatory minimum.
Our LCR increased to 129%, 29 percentage points above our regulatory minimum and our primary
unencumbered sources of liquidity were approximately $511 billion.
Turning to loans on page 5. Similar to industry trends, period-end consumer and commercial loans outstanding
declined in the second quarter but average balances grew reflecting increases in outstanding balances late in the
first quarter. I'll explain the drivers of consumer and commercial period-end loan balances in more detail starting
with consumer on page 6.
Consumer loans were down $20.1 billion or 5% from the first quarter. This decline includes the reclassification of
$10.4 billion of conforming first mortgage loans to held-for-sale status to provide flexibility to manage our balance
sheet under the asset cap. The economic slowdown from COVID-19 reduced consumer spending and was
reflected in lower credit card balances, lower auto originations and other revolving and installment loan balances.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
In addition, we took actions during the second quarter to tighten credit standards given the current economic
environment and to manage to the constraints of the asset cap.
These actions included no longer purchasing jumbo mortgage loans through our correspondent mortgage
business and not accepting home equity and personal line of credit applications. In the auto business, we've
taken actions to mitigate future loss exposure and our spreads on new originations improved to their highest
levels since 2016.
That said, as states began to reopen later in the quarter, we saw increased loan demand including higher credit
card spending and higher auto loan originations.
Turning to commercial loans on page 7, C&I loans declined $54.9 billion or 14% from the first quarter driven by
paydowns of revolving loans following increased loan draws in the first quarter during the market turbulence at the
onset of the pandemic. As Charlie highlighted, almost all of the $80 billion of loan draws in March were paid down
during the second quarter. These paydowns were partially driven by strength in capital markets and helped drive
record revenues in the second quarter in our Corporate and Investment Bank.
Commercial real estate loans increased $2.1 billion from the first quarter with growth in both commercial real
estate mortgage and in construction loans.
Turning to deposits on page 8. The industry has experienced very strong growth but due to our asset cap
constraint we've worked to manage growth of certain lower liquidity value deposit categories; however even after
these actions, average deposits grew 9% from a year-ago and 4% from the first quarter. The linked-quarter
growth was driven by noninterest bearing deposits which were up 18% while interest-bearing deposits declined
1%.
Period-end Consumer and Small Business Banking deposits grew $78.6 billion from the first quarter. This strong
growth reflected COVID-19-related impacts including customers' preference for liquidity, loan and tax payment
deferrals which otherwise would have reduced deposits, stimulus checks and lower consumer spending.
Wholesale Banking deposits declined $32.1 billion reflecting actions we took to manage under the asset cap
including an emphasis on reducing certain nonoperational deposits. Average deposit costs declined to 17 basis
points, down 35 basis points from the first quarter with declines across all of our lines of business. While
Wholesale Banking deposit costs declined the most reflecting higher deposit betas, both WIM and Retail Banking
deposit costs also declined. We currently have no active Retail Banking promotions and we expect deposit costs
will continue to decline in the second-half of this year and reach the single-digit lows realized in 2015 and 2016.
Net interest income declined $1.4 billion or 13% from the first quarter due to balance sheet repricing driven by the
impact of a lower interest rate environment, $275 million less favorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results
driven by large interest rate changes, $187 million of higher MBS premium amortization due to higher prepayment
rates, and these declines were partially offset by a shift to a lower-cost mix of funding.
Net interest income was down 13% for the first half of the year, and as I discussed in June, we currently expect
net interest income to be in the $41 billion to $42 billion range for the full year 2020 which would be down 11% to
13% from the full year of 2019. This decline reflects the lower interest rate environment and the constraints the
asset cap places on our ability to grow the size of our balance sheet as well as higher MBS premium amortization
which we expect to persist for the remainder of the year.

Turning to page 10. Noninterest income increased $1.6 billion or 24% from the first quarter, driven by a $1.9
billion increase in net gains from equity securities reflecting lower securities impairment and higher deferred
compensation plan investment results. I'll explain some of these drivers in more detail.
Deposit service charges were down $279 million from the first quarter driven by COVID-19 related impacts
including lower overdrafts as customers have reduced debit card transactions and increased deposit balances, as
well as higher fee waivers. Trust and investment fees declined $223 million from the first quarter. Investment
banking had a strong quarter with revenue increasing $156 million or 40% driven by strength in debt and equity
capital markets. This growth was more than offset by both lower retail brokerage advisory fees which were priced
at the beginning of the second quarter when market levels for advisory assets were – pricing were lower and
declined in brokerage transactional revenue.
Mortgage banking revenue was relatively stable linked-quarter with strong growth in mortgage loan originations
more than offset – offset by declines in servicing income, total residential held-for-sale originations increased 30%
from the first quarter to $43 billion primarily driven by lower mortgage interest rates. Lower interest rates drove
strong industry volume with second quarter estimated to be the largest origination market since the third quarter
of 2003. As we managed our application pipeline to handle this strong demand, our margins increased.
In the second quarter our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage loans was 204 basis points, up
from 108 basis points in the first quarter. We've continued to add capacity and expect originations to increase in
the third quarter if rates remain low, and we would expect margins to be relatively stable with second quarter
levels.
Servicing revenue declined $960 million from the first quarter. The decline was driven by a lower valuation of our
MSR asset as a result of updated assumptions including higher prepayment assumptions and higher expected
servicing costs due to an increase in projected defaults. Servicing fees were also lower due to payment deferrals
and fee waivers provided to our customers in response to the pandemic.
Finally, net gains from trading activities increased $743 million from higher trading volumes across many
products, increased volatility leading to wider bid/offer spreads and substantial spread and price improvement in
certain capital markets.
Turning to expenses on page 11. As Charlie highlighted, our expenses are too high and we're beginning to take
further action to improve our efficiency. The $1.5 billion increase in our expenses from the first quarter was driven
by higher operating losses as well as higher personnel expense reflecting a $947 million increase in deferred
comp expense. Charlie described the $1.2 billion of operating losses which included $765 million of customer
remediation accruals for a variety of matters as well as higher litigation accruals.
The $597 million increase in personnel expense included the increase in deferred compensation which is P&L
neutral and $231 million of COVID-19-related employee expenses including premium pay for those who had to
come into the office and payments for backup childcare. Most of the COVID-19-related employee expenses have
now expired.
We also had $133 million of higher COVID-19-related occupancy expense to make our properties safer for our
employees and customers including enhanced cleaning, additional supplies, and workstation modifications. These
costs will likely remain elevated until the pandemic ends. The impact of COVID-19 also reduced some of our
expenses including travel and entertainment, and advertising and promotion expense.

Turning to our business segments starting on page 12, as Charlie highlighted, we now have the leadership for our
five business segments in place and we will transition to reporting our segments in accordance with the structure
starting in the third quarter. Community Banking reported a net loss of $331 million driven by an increase in
provision expense.
On page 13, we provide our Community Banking metrics. We had 31.1 billion digital active customers, up 4%
from a year ago. While the number of digital customers remain stable from the first quarter, these customers are
doing more digitally with logins up 10% from the first quarter, and the number of checks deposited using a mobile
device reaching a record high in the second quarter up 32% from the first quarter.
Approximately 20% of our branches are temporarily closed due to COVID-19. As a result of fewer branches being
open and increased digital usage, teller and ATM transactions were down 19% from the first quarter and 28%
from a year ago; however we still have approximately 1 million teller transactions occurring at our branches every
business day.
Our customers demand for cash has decreased by approximately 20% compared to a year ago. This decrease
was reflected in lower demand for cash in our branches. While ATM transaction volume was down the amount of
cash withdrawn at our ATMs has increased reflecting higher-levels of cash per withdrawal, in part driven by the
higher ATM withdrawal limits we implemented in the first quarter.
Charlie highlighted the improving trends we experienced during the second quarter for debit and credit card
spend. Higher debit card spend later in the quarter resulted in total second quarter spend being flat compared
with a year ago; however transaction volume was down 13% from a year ago with customers spending more per
transaction. As a reminder, debit card fees are based on transaction volume, not dollar volume.
Turning to page 14. Wholesale Banking reported a net loss of $2.1 billion as revenue growth was more than offset
by an increase in provision for credit losses. I've already discussed the drivers on loans and deposits, so let me
highlight a few other business drivers.
Corporate and Investment Banking capital markets had record revenue in the second quarter driven by the
trading revenue increases I described earlier and record investment-grade debt issuance. Wells Fargo Capital
Finance was the number one book runner of asset-based loans with year-to-date market share increasing to 20%.
We maintained our leadership position in this market by providing an important source of liquidity to our
customers during a very challenging time.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $180 million in the second quarter, down 61% from the first quarter
primarily driven by an increase in the allowance for credit losses, the lower interest rate environment, and lower
market valuations at the beginning of the quarter. We continued to experience strong demand from clients for
liquidity products with growth in deposits and money market funds and our asset management business. Wells
Fargo Asset Management achieved a record high $578 billion in assets under management in the second quarter,
up 12% from the first quarter driven by continued momentum in the money market business, higher market
valuations, and fixed income net inflows. While advisory assets in our brokerage business increased 14% during
the quarter, we had lower retail brokerage advisory fees since they're priced at the beginning of the quarter when
market valuations were lower. These fees will benefit from the stronger markets at the beginning of the third
quarter.
Turning to credit results for the company on page 16. Our net charge-off rate was up 8 basis points from the first
quarter to 46 basis points which is still a historically low level particularly during an extremely challenging
11

economic environment. Keep in mind that the significant amount of customer accommodations we've provided for
our consumer and commercial customers since the start of the pandemic will delay the recognition of net charge-
offs, delinquencies and nonaccrual status for those customers who would have otherwise moved into past due or
nonaccrual status; however I will point out that this dynamic was considered in our allowance for credit losses.
Commercial criticized assets increased $13.3 billion or 53% from the first quarter with C&I up $7.2 billion and
CRE up $6.1 billion. Nonaccrual loans increased $1.4 billion from the first quarter driven by growth in commercial
nonaccruals. I would note that 75% of our commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest and principal as
of the end of the second quarter.
We provide more detail on C&I nonaccrual loans on page 17. While C&I loans outstanding and total commitments
declined from the first quarter, nonaccrual loans increased 59% driven by oil and gas and real estate and
construction C&I loans, which includes credit facilities to REITs and other non-depository financial institutions.
Last quarter, we provided more details on industries with escalated monitoring and those industries largely drove
the increase in criticized assets in the second quarter, including retail, entertainment and recreation.
Turning to our community real estate portfolio on slide 18. We are the nation's largest commercial real estate
lender and our portfolio is well diversified both by property type and geography. Our commercial real estate loans
are subjected to rigorous underwriting standards and are well structured. Before COVID-19 this portfolio was
performing at historically strong credit levels with a good mix of assets and geography, a well-capitalized
customer base and overall low levels of leverage. We had proactively reduced our exposure to retail and have
minimal exposure to land or condos where losses were highest in the last cycle.
Since the pandemic began, we've worked to assist customers on a case-by-case basis. We've continued our strict
routine monitoring process with the goal of identifying problems early. Our CRE team has an experienced bench
with workout backgrounds and perspective in times of distress which has enabled us to ramp up quickly; however
these are unprecedented times and nonaccruals were up $286 million or 30% from the first quarter.
Given what's been going in the economy it's not surprising that shopping centers, retail and hotels, motels
accounted for 59% of nonaccrual loans in the second quarter and accounted for 90% of the increase from the first
quarter. Criticized assets were up $6.1 billion or 140% from the first quarter driven by the same sectors that drove
the increase in nonaccruals with the addition of office buildings.
Turning to our oil and gas portfolio on page 19. Oil and gas loans accounted for 1% of our total loans outstanding
with $12.6 billion outstanding at the end of the quarter, down 12% from the first quarter. Total commitments were
down $1.7 billion from the first quarter reflecting the impact of spring redetermination changes on borrowing
bases, proactive portfolio management, as well as the weaker credit environment.
Net charge-offs increased $111 million from the first quarter with 87% of second quarter net charge-offs from the
E&P sector. Nonaccrual loans increased $865 million from the first quarter with approximately 93% of
nonaccruals still current on payments.
Criticized loans increased 26% from the first quarter reflecting downward credit migration resulting from
commodity price volatility and included numerous credit downgrades of publicly-rated companies.
On page 20, we provide detail on our allowance for credit losses. The $8.4 billion increase included $6.4 billion for
commercial loans and $2 billion for consumer loans. Our allowance coverage for total loans was 2.19%, up 100

basis points from the end of the first quarter with the largest increases across commercial loans, junior lien
mortgage loans and credit card loans.
We highlight the key drivers of the increase in our allowance for credit losses on page 21. We considered current
economic conditions which worsened significantly compared to prior expectations as unemployment levels
reached 14.7% in the second quarter. In addition, over $2.4 trillion in fiscal stimulus programs as well as customer
accommodations provided near-term support for borrowers. On this page we provide details on the economic
forecasts in our base case scenario for the second quarter allowance which assumes near-term economic stress
recovering into late 2021 including unemployment levels declining to approximately 6% by the fourth quarter of
2021.
While housing prices are forecasted to remain relatively stable, commercial real estate prices are forecasted to
decline by low to mid-teens with hotel, restaurant and retail sectors expected to decline much further. In addition,
collateral prices remain highly uncertain given limited property sales.
While the large majority of weight is placed on the base case scenario, we applied some weighting to a downside
scenario to reflect the uncertainty in the economic forecast. And as I previously-mentioned, customer forbearance
and other deferral activities provided in response to COVID-19 were considered in our loan portfolio performance
expectations and loss forecast.
However please keep in mind that our allowance for credit losses is influenced by a variety of factors including
changes in loan volumes, portfolio credit quality as well as general economic conditions. While the timing of the
end of the pandemic and the eventual path to economic recovery remain unclear, we believe that our allowance
captures the expected loss content in our portfolio as of the end of the second quarter.
Turning to capital on page 22. As I highlighted earlier, our CET1 ratio increased to 10.9% in the second quarter.
We elected to apply the modified CECL transition provision to our regulatory capital, the impact of this selection
was the increase in capital of $1.9 billion and a 14 basis point increase in our CET1 ratio. Additionally as a result
of senior debt issuance during the second quarter, and a decline in our RWA, our TLAC ratio increased to 25.3%
which provides a significant buffer to our required minimum of 22%.
In summary, our results from the second quarter were disappointing and economic conditions remain uncertain,
but we're focused on doing the work necessary to improve the earnings capacity of the company including
reducing our expenses while meeting our regulatory commitments.
And Charlie and I will now take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of
America. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes, good morning. My first question is a clarification question for Charlie. Charlie, during your prepared remarks
you noted that your expenses were about $10 billion greater than your peers or where you – you need to be – to
be equivalent to peers on efficiency. Are you saying that lopping off $10 billion in expenses is an eventual long-
term goal for this company to be in line with your larger peers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, I mean, what I said was that the math – if you do the math, what it says is that when you look at their
efficiency ratios versus ours, our expenses are at least $10 billion higher than they should be and there's no
reason why that should occur. And so we are doing the work to create a roadmap for a company which is
significantly more efficient. Exactly what the timeframe is and where we ultimately get to, I think that we'll provide
more information on when the future play itself out but we can do the same math that you can do and there's no
reason why as a management team we don't have the ability to be as efficient as the rest.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. That's clear. And my follow-up question has to do with is the potential for the Fed to extend the income test
beyond third quarter dividend. And I'm wondering, so as we think about – you mentioned that expenses should
start coming down in 2021, as I think about how consensus is formulating future earnings power, I think
consensus is expecting that your – the majority of your reserve build should be behind you. But I don't think that
restructuring costs, for example, that would relate to future efficiency initiatives are in with consensus. And I guess
the question that I'm really asking here is that if the Fed extends the income test beyond the third quarter, do you
feel confident that according to how they're looking at dividend capacity the $0.10 is supportable going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Sure. This is John. They certainly have the ability to extend the current framework and frankly it even seems likely
just given the way the calendar lines up and the resubmission process is going to work for the next CCAR.
I think Charlie's point is we're going to do what's necessary to get as efficient as we can be. And to the extent that
that kicks off one-time charges, which you might expect, and if that has an influence on our dividend capacity as a
result of the Fed keeping the current regime in place, then we'll have to tolerate that. I don't think we're not going
to do what's right economically because of accounting consequences, we're going to do – we're going to follow
GAAP, we're going to get as efficient as we can, the outcome's going to be the outcome.
In part, we've set the current dividend or proposed to set the current dividend where it is so that it would buy us
plenty of room to operate while we get through the next few quarters and chart the eventual path to greater

profitability but accounting consequences will be what they are. It wasn't a primary consideration in setting the
number where we did.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
The only thing I would add is I think – is that when we think of the work that we did, we didn't – our board didn't
approach this conversation around the dividend with an idea of looking at it each quarter and making a
determination. And so our hope is that this does become a level which is sustainable as we go through this period
of uncertainty and as the Fed decides how they want to treat capital return over the next series of quarters.
We do have some items that impact our capital – our ability to return capital with this rule that doesn't reflect our
earnings power going forward, right. We had a $3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice which is in our
historical numbers. That $3 billion when you look at it is something like round numbers, $0.18 a share of a
negative that ultimately will roll out and is already actually in our capital number. So we have these dynamics that
the board thought about when we set the dividend level for the quarter that don't relate to the future earnings
capacity of the company even as we look out into 2021.

Hi, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning. John, could you remind us just where you are on the asset cap flexibility, what needs to be done
each quarter now with deposits coming in and some loan demand, and what kind of flexibility you have to operate
under that and where you are today on the way it gets measured? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Sure. Sure. So we were in compliance with it at the end of the second quarter. And the items that we did during
the late first and early second quarter to maintain compliance were really focused on our wholesale funding
footprint by shrinking the amount of external repo and other financing that we do in taking trading assets down.
And we had a focus on certain categories of nonoperational deposits, the ones that have very low liquidity value.
And it's really – this is from this point forward, this is more of a liability management exercise to make sure that we
don't retain too much in the way of low liquidity value deposits, that we're thoughtful about other liabilities.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
On the asset side there's so much cash on the balance sheet right now that it gives plenty of flexibility I think to do
what we need to do with loans. You saw that our LCR print was 129% for the quarter and deposits have grown
nicely. So we're very thoughtful and cautious about how we price deposits, about those that have low liquidity
value. We're thoughtful about maturities as they come up in non-deposit funding because with the inflow of
deposits we can rely more on that and less on notes, and institutional CDs and other things. That's the work that
we've been doing and that's the path that we have for the next quarter or two.

John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And you reiterated the net interest income outlook for the year. How should we think about kind of the
jumping off point for the net interest margin and net interest income as we go into next quarter? What are some of
the puts and takes that we should factor into the model?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
I think it's going to be relatively flat from where it is today, we're sort of – we're in that zone. And as I said, $41
billion to $42 billion for the year still feels like the right number. So I think it'll be – we're not really carefully
managing the NIM, it's we're looking for the dollars and net interest income but it shouldn't deviate too much from
where we are right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. Got it and is there anything in terms of asset cap progress, Charlie can comment on? I know you can't say
too much but in terms of the work being done and progress in doing what you need to do to satisfy the Fed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
John, I appreciate everyone being interested, given the limitations of it and asking the question, it's going to be
the same response every single quarter which is we're focused on it. It is along with the other enforcement
actions, the biggest priority that we have. We're doing our work, and the Fed will determine when the work is done
to their satisfaction.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys – hey, thanks for taking it. John, just was hoping you might be able to update or refresh your
thoughts on how and sort of when losses might evolve, I guess embedded in that as sort of how are you treating
re-upped deferral requests, things like that. And I guess, additionally, the updated reserves build, kind of implies
sort of what you're thinking about cumulative losses through the period, but just any updated thoughts you can
share, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Well, as it relates to deferrals which generally speaking is the consumer side of the house, the fact that we
are deferring definitely pushes out rolls through delinquency buckets into charge-off. And so the actual charge-
offs themselves will probably come later than they otherwise would. We believe that we fully provided or captured
that in the allowance, so we've taken the credit charge today that we think is the right one at the end of the
quarter, even if the charge-offs come somewhat later.
We're also seeing – we saw a tick up in charge-offs in commercial but there also things do take a little bit before
they roll. I think – I guess I would expect the charge-off rates and they will be different by asset category to sort of
move up slowly through the end of the year, even into the first couple quarters and next year and then start to
flatten out after that, just based on, on the way things progress through loss recognition.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just to switch gears a little. The additional customer remediation accruals, Charlie
or John, could you go through sort of the – I know you alluded to sort of taking a fresh look at things under new
management but I guess, curious given the charges we've already seen over the past couple of years sort of what
drove those additional accruals in the new thinking?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. So as Charlie said, it was new leadership at the top of the organization in Consumer Lending and in the
center capability that we have running, customer remediation. I think they've gone item-by-item and thought about
how to be – a little bit more expensive, a little bit more consumer-friendly. Many of these things aren't crystal clear
and you're always making a judgment as to who it applies to, how much should apply and over what timeframe
and really in an effort, as Charlie said, to speed it up and move it through, they were a little bit more expensive in
order to accomplish that. But it's – by and large it's the same items that we've been talking about for the last
couple of years. There are always new things that come in and out of that bucket but the bigger dollars relate to
the same topics that we've been covering for a while.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
The only thing I'd emphasize, as John said as most of the dollar do relate to those items and there's a lot of value
in getting these things behind us. It's the work, it's the overhang, it's what our customers and communities think
about us, and so we're obviously going to do what's right for the financial position of the company but we want to
treat people properly and we want to move on and move to the future. And so we made decisions around what we
were willing to do, certainly with that balanced lens.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hi, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Hey, couple of questions. So first off, Charlie just wanted to get a sense as to where we should
be thinking about where the expense improvements come from. And the reason I'm asking is – I know you're in
the middle of business unit reviews, you've got new business unit heads in several places, typically folks like that
are going to want to make investments, you're not going to touch the regulatory side. So where should we
anticipate you have room to start bringing down expenses ahead of regulatory framework changes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. And I think your point is actually a very important one which is part of the reason why we've been – we're
trying to be very careful about making it clear that we are going forward and actively going to start to take actions
to reduce expenses. But we don't want to back ourselves into a corner until all of our work is done, because of
those two things that you mentioned which are very important.
Having said that, and the reality is that the work that we have to do, the foundational work to build [ph] of the risk
and control (00:56:44) infrastructure and ultimately satisfy the work that the regulators would like us to satisfy, it's
clear, it's distinct. It is fairly broad across the company, but we know exactly what it is and what resources are
protect against that.
When we look elsewhere in the company, and I think I used the words in the prepared remarks, it is we just – we
have spans and layers at the company which are well beyond what I've seen at other places and makes us a
very, very inefficient company. When we just look at the work that's being generated, the things that are being
done, we as a management team believe that we can change the priorities so that we're being really clear on
what has to get done, and stop a bunch of work that has to get done. We have duplicative platforms, duplicative
processes across the company. And so as we think about a series of these things, they are extremely significant
because these things exist just about in every part of the company.
In addition, I just also want to point out that we have stopped any reductions that were going to take place just
given the environment. And so there is a series of actions that we are ready to take. In fact, we have a series of
employees who have been told that their jobs will ultimately go away but we were going to let some time pass as
18


Wells Fargo & Co.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
we got through the initial stages of the COVID crisis, so we do see a clear path to start making an impact on the
expense base and it's like an onion, the more we do, the more clearer the next round will become.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And is that saying that you could start in the second half. I know you mentioned that we'd see the benefits here in
2021 with expenses below 2020, but should we anticipate that some of this will start in second half 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
We are clearly going to take the actions in the second half of this year and obviously depending on what the
economics of all that is and the accounting of it, not quite sure whether you'll see it – or in next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Yeah, Okay. That's understandable. And then could I just switch gears to a question on mortgage? So the
question here – oh yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Betsy, I just want to add one thing which I just think is important which is because I didn't say this in the prepared
remarks but I've certainly talked about this inside the company, which is we don't look at a quarter like this and
just say, okay, that is what it is. Losses are higher, our margins are narrow. We know we've got some work going
on and so we'll eventually get around to it. While we knew these things had to get done and the work was getting
done, it's not lost on us. Our underperformance relative to where we should be earning, and so while I think there
was a sense of urgency towards both getting the regulatory work done and improving our performance, whatever
sense of urgency existed before is going to be small relative to what it is going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Yeah, I get that.

Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Sorry that I had to interrupt you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
No, I get that and I also – I'm hearing in your commentary that the costs around the regulatory and the risk and –
those costs – is it fair to say are more known today than they were maybe a year ago?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, I think absolutely as time goes on and we become – we could get much clearer on what has to get done,
it's clearly easier for us to put a broad understanding of what that takes. And again, just to be clear, when we go –
and part of the reason why it takes us a period of time to do this properly is we're going to have very formal
19


Wells Fargo & Co.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
processes in place to ensure whatever reductions in our expense base we take that they do not impact any of that
work, and so that'll be informal and it will be very, very formal, because that would be just a terrible, terrible
mistake for everyone if we were not to do that properly, so beyond heightened consciousness on that issue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. All right. Just switching to mortgage. Refi speeds have been incredibly high and through second quarter.
And John, I just wanted to get your sense as to what's in your base case assumptions for 3Q/4Q, I mean part of
the reason for asking is it impacts the servicing, prepayment speeds, it impacts your NII outlook with the
refinancing on the agency. And then I also just wanted to have a quick follow-up question here on the Ginnie
buyouts that you did that the American Banker highlighted this morning, just understanding is that the first of
many or not? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Good question. So on mortgage speeds, and it shows up in the MSR, shows up in our investment portfolio
and it shows up in the run-off of booked loans that are in our held-for-investment portfolio in loan form. The speed
assumptions vary depending on the vintage, the coupon, the debt to income, the LTV et cetera and the
refinanceability of borrower by borrower, but I think we're as aware as anyone of how fast things have gotten and
we're seeing 30 handle CPR on various pools of loans. And so while we think we've captured that in our updated
estimates on the MSR in particular, it does feed into this level of, call it, $500 million to $700 million per quarter of
premium amortization for mortgage securities which as I said is likely to remain for the rest of the year.
On Ginnie buyouts, what's happening there is that there are loans that have gone delinquent in part because of
COVID, and as the servicer, we essentially have the accounting consequence of owning them, whether we buy
them out or not. They're deemed – because the – the option to purchase them is so deeply in the money, we're
deemed to have bought them and so our calculus was either to have a giant pile of cash and that consolidated
asset or to go ahead and buy them out and not have that asset – essentially that asset twice but use the cash to
buy the asset. And these are guaranteed loans from our perspective, not a huge credit consequence. It's just
carrying the asset for a period of time before it either gets redelivered or sold or worked out in some way. So
that's why we were a big buyer in the – in the – actually that was after the end of the quarter.
And then with respect to whether it continues on, if it's – well, facts and circumstances, the same tension will
apply if we're deemed to have them on our books because we have the option to buy them, then we may – and if
cash levels remain where they are, then we may go ahead and do it just so we don't really double up the size of
our balance sheet and that is an asset cap consideration.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. No, it makes a ton of sense but so it's a function of in – more forbearance from here, is that the driver?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
More/ongoing, that's right. And whether we're the servicer or not. But that's – that's right.

John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. So I think on the deposit cost side, our anticipation is that between the reduction in pricing for interest-
bearing deposits and the growth or continuity of noninterest-bearing deposits that our average deposit cost is
back in the single-digit basis points by the third or fourth quarter. That's the trajectory that we're on. That's where
we were in 2015/2016.
On the asset side depending on what happens to LIBOR probably in particular, spreads are holding firm where
we're lending and there will be some – there could be some lower spread loan product that is replaced with
higher. You've heard about that in autos. It's true in some categories of C&I, but that's a piece of it.
On the securities front we've been trying to stay invested but the level of prepayments that Betsy just referred to I
think at our securities portfolio down by almost $30 billion in the quarter, and so how much more duration we want
to add at these low yields is a separate issue. We haven't been adding much in credit-related securities product.
But as I mentioned I think to John, the outlook for NIM is relatively range-bound through the rest of the year.
We're sort of bumping along what we think the bottom could be. I mean obviously things could change, but at a
zero on the front-end and 60, 70 basis points on the long-end this feels about where we're likely to be with the
things that I mentioned.

Right. And then so I guess then really just NII growth next year or just you're starting from a high point this year,
so we'll probably be in the hole still next year, but really does it depend on the asset cap then or does it depend
on the mix of earning assets in order to get that kind of off this $10 billion-ish type of NII number?

John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. It's a good question. It's both so it's – what choices we make on the asset side and what the market is
offering, where loan demand comes from I think will matter a lot. The slope of the curve, if things get a little
steeper that obviously could be helpful because we're so exposed at the long-end, and then if there's an
opportunity to have a bigger balance sheet we're certainly not budgeting that way or counting on it, but that would
be a difference-maker.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. One just quick follow-up, John, on the servicing side of mortgage, great production in the tougher servicing
results. There's both the core fees that are contracting because of the prepays and then there's all the hedging.
What's the best way you can help us understand how that mortgage banking line item just trajects from here given
especially the uncertainty and how you model out the servicing side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. It's tricky but – so, I think what we've said is we expect volumes on the production side to be a little bit
higher and margins to be relatively constant. So if those two things hold true, the third quarter should be a
relatively great production environment for mortgage. And on the servicing side, we think we've captured the
higher servicing costs for default servicing, modification servicing et cetera. We now have faster speed
expectations in the model, although we said that a quarter ago too, we were surprised on the downside. But if
both of those things are captured then we will produce lower servicing fees because the book itself is getting
smaller, but I'll take smaller servicing revenue as long as we're not taking big write-downs on the assets that are
offsetting the benefit that we're generating on the origination side and hopefully the third quarter reflects that.

for you guys obviously that does matter given the size of the preferred stock dividend. So just wanted to make

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A

Correct. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. A much, much, much broader question and kudos on the donation to CDFIs that, I think, a lot of
them do a lot of very good work. And I guess on that point though, I do think that it's pretty clear that Wells does
have to maybe more than others really focus on multiple stakeholders and different goals. And the idea of strictly
shareholder-driven capital is obviously already under attack and you have to make your regulators, meet their
demands, employees, I think you genuinely are concerned about the well-being of the communities you work in,
and then you have guys like me who talk about your ROCEs and your super high efficiency ratios, how you're
going to right-size your cost structures. And I guess how do you think about that – that the balancing act of those
competing demands? I think in the past most management teams have argued that they can do all of those things
simultaneously, and I think to a certain degree maybe that is true but there are some trade-offs, and some
element of a zero-sum dynamic going on. So I guess Charlie I'm curious maybe just more philosophically how you
think about that and I guess ultimately how do you think about shareholder value in that totem pole of goals.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. I guess I don't think about it as a trade-off, and I don't think about it as something which is different for us
versus other significant companies, whether you're a financial institution or not. I think it is very, very clear that our
ability to be successful as a company for our shareholders includes the fact that we are broadly considering a
much broader set of stakeholders. If we don't do that, customers, whether they're consumers or companies,
ultimately won't want to be supportive of us, we'll have issues in our local communities, it'll filter through to the
legislative and likely the regulatory agenda. So I think we very much think that they are very much related and that
there's no reason why the things that we should be doing to be more thoughtful of a broader set of stakeholders,
they aren't a set of financial negatives. Ultimately it should be something beyond that.
The PPP fees were certainly something that was very unique. We're in the middle of this really horrific time for
small businesses and especially minority-owned small businesses. The right thing for us as a significant company
in this country is to be as helpful as we can with that community. It's also ultimately helpful for us if we can make a
difference in the communities that we operate, and then we also looked at that relative to just what we thought
was fair for us in order to participate in the PPP program. And so I think you put all those things together and
there is alignment and those that don't think about it that way will likely suffer over the long-term.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. So I wanted to start off, Charlie, with just a theoretical question on the asset cap. You talked
about the proactive steps that were taken to manage the balance sheet to stay below and how that's negatively
impacted NII. Since most investors are focusing at this juncture on normalized NII and through-the-cycle revenue
growth expectations, if the Fed were to lift the asset cap tomorrow I was hoping you could give us some idea or
context around the amount of pent-up growth potential in the balance sheet today. Just I think it would be helpful if
you could frame the impact of the asset cap on NII or at least volume growth based on where things stand today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
So, this is John, if – just as a data point using rough math, if our balance sheet was expanded by, call it, $200
billion or about 10% during this COVID timeframe and there's a question about whether there was ample
opportunity to do that around several asset classes, but in certain areas it certainly was, it was something like our
average NIM, the impact that that would have had on us would have been – and this is easier approximations, but
to reduce the draw down on NII by 50%, so half of how things have worsened would have been covered by that
expansion of the balance sheet. That's one way to think about it.
There were more immediate opportunities to put loans on, in particular I would say in March as capital markets
were closed, I think everybody knows that and we saw customers drawing on available facilities and other
requests for new facilities. The bigger, probably more constant piece of an increased balance sheet, at least in the
businesses that we serve today would probably be to have a bigger securities and securities financing portfolio in
support of our Corporate and Investment Bank where we have drawn down as part of managing under the asset
cap. And there's a handful of benefits to that, including being able to do more business with the companies that
were – and the institutions that were financing in that realm.
But you also end up with a big LIBOR-funded book that is a little bit less asymmetric in a down-rate scenario and
we certainly suffered from that. There's a real benefit to being substantially deposit funded in that it's very low-cost
to begin with, but in a down-rate environment, it's a little bit more violent in terms of the outcome that it generates,
and to have a bigger component piece of LIBOR-funded assets – of LIBOR-funded liabilities, it's a little bit less
high producing in the best of times, but it maintains its margin in a down-rate environment, so that would have
been a benefit also. I don't know, Charlie, may have other thoughts.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
Okay. No. That's helpful color, John. So, thanks for that. Just had one more question. This one I guess I've asked
over the last couple of quarters, but wanted to get some context around the core fee income level or the jumping
off point which you think about for the back half. You cited some of the tailwinds from mortgage production, trust
fee should benefit from the higher markets, but you also have some normalization of trading activity, and just
given all the different moving pieces, I was hoping you could give us some sense as to what the right jumping off
point might be for 3Q.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. We don't put a number on it and call it core, but rather talk about the component pieces of it. And so,
service charges on deposits, which is a big one for us, my assumption is that it's going to feel at least for a while
like it does today. People are spending differently. They are maintaining cash balances at a higher level. And so,
there are – whether it's waivers because of high balances or the absence of overdraft that puts pressure on that
line item as our customers do what's right for them in this environment. You mentioned brokerage advisory, et
cetera, that should be stronger going into the second half of the year. Investment Banking, we had a record high-
grade market in the first quarter, so while other activity may pick up a little bit, my sense is that that probably
normalizes somewhat.
Card fees have reflected – I mentioned in my prepared remarks which is at least in the debit card space, we've
got balances or flows in dollar terms about equal to last year, but the number of transaction is lower which has a
negative impact in card fees, and credit card fees have been improving, but haven't caught up. So, I don't think it's
going to pop back up anytime really quickly. Mortgage, I mentioned, on the production side should be very strong
or should be strong, and hopefully, we've accounted for faster speeds and higher costs in servicing. Trading, as
you said, probably gets a little bit softer and other items are less material and there's nothing really noteworthy.
So, that's how I think about the categories.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
Hi. I want to circle back on kind of the longer-term view of getting your efficiency closer to peers. And I guess the
first question is why do you necessarily think it's an expense issue versus a revenue issue or is it a combination of
both?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
It's definitely a combination of both. Revenue, particularly interest income, which doesn't carry a lot of expense
load, would be very helpful. I think what we're trying to do is assess where the company is today and what we can
do about it, and we can do more about expense than we can about revenue in a balance sheet constrained
environment, in a recession and in a low-rate environment. So, it's actionable by the management team, but
without a doubt, some amount of normalization of certain categories of revenue would contribute to it. But having
said that, I think we've sort of vectored in in a variety of different ways on the idea that, all things being equal, and
I'm sure they won't be, but at least as we think about it today that $10 billion is a reasonable amount to go after to
put Wells Fargo on a level playing field with the large-cap peers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
And the only thing I would add to what John said is, this isn't – the calculation of the $10 billion, that's a
mathematical exercise. When the management team, the Operating Committee gets in a room, there is absolutely
no disagreement in the room, not about the math, but about the inefficiencies that exist inside the company, away
from all of these risk-related activities. And the work that we've been doing is to build the plans from the bottom-up
to identify where that is. And so, whether that's the full $10 billion or not, we'll see what we get to, but there is –
we certainly have a clear belief that we can make a significant dent based upon what we know.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And just to be clear what you think kind of the longer-term cost base can be, when you use the $10 billion as kind
of a reference point, should we just annualize this quarter's costs that gets you about $58 billion, you take out $10
billion, gets you around $48 billion, I mean is that the thought process?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
I think $54 billion-ish is more of the normalized starting point without the excess expenses that are loaded into this
quarter for the items that we mentioned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So, take $10 billion off the $54 billion?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
Okay. And I guess just related to that, like whenever I think about kind of cost saves, like there are areas that
you'll want to invest in, there is just natural inflation creep. So, I mean you guys kind of opened up a little bit of the
can of worms on the $10 billion, so I know these are things that are tough to predict, like looking out a few years,
but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
But we didn't open a can of worms because – I don't look at it like we opened a can of worms, I think we look at it
like we're acknowledging what the facts are, which is the facts are as we compete with other companies that are
investing tremendously and with those set of investments, the math says the following. And so, what we – we
again purposely haven't said we're going to reduce our expenses by a certain point in time, because we are doing
the work to figure out what the timing looks like with our reductions versus our investments. But I think what's
important is not just that we acknowledge that that gap exists, but we are proactively working to get to a place
which makes sense, both from an efficiency standpoint, knowing that we should be investing in the business.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thanks. Thanks for the question. So, we do the math to compare our own estimations to the DFAST outcomes,
but we don't think of them as necessarily better informed about our loans and our portfolios and our risk profile
and our collection activity, et cetera. So, that's – it's a useful data point and it's an external one that people can
judge against, but we think more about our own experience and the scenarios that we believe are the likely ones
in the world that we're living in. And so, that's how we focused it.
With the build that we made in the allowance, I think we're at almost 2.2% coverage of the outstanding loan
portfolio, and of course, it's very different by loan category like it is for every other bank. I think we believe that if
the world unfolds in the way that we've got it modeled and assumed in our both modeled loss estimations and in
our bottoms-up portfolio by portfolio work that we will have captured the loss content in the portfolio as of the end
of the quarter, and as a result, unless things really [indiscernible] (01:25:51) in a worse direction that this would
be, this would have accounted for those losses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Thanks, John. And then, related to that, on the commercial real estate side, just want to see if you could
discuss the credit trends that you're seeing in commercial real estate. I know that delinquencies in CMBS
structures really spiked for the industry beyond even financial crisis levels and – but clearly, that is being staved
off somewhat at the banks by forbearance efforts. Are you – could you just give us a little bit of that granularity
around what you're seeing and the level of forbearance in commercial real estate, and is it seeing greater
pressure in the portfolio to forbear, given the pressure that your borrowers are seeing? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. The first distinguishing point I'd make is that, and I know you know this, but for everybody's benefit, the
CMBS structures are nonrecourse loans. And so, there's no alternative other than realizing on the collateral,
there's no mechanism for extra cash flow to enter into a structure unless somebody does something that they're
not contractually obligated to do to try and shore things up. And I think as I've seen most recently, the June
numbers in CMBS are about 13% of loans are not current.
Conversely on a bank's balance sheet, most of the loans that we have, have real sponsorship and recourse, and
generally speaking are lower LTV than CMBS to begin with. So, our actual performance is quite different. And
then, I think we talked about this last quarter, too, but the variation in how deep we'll go from an LTV perspective
is, as you'd hope, with the more stable property types, we might have higher leverage, and with the least stable
property types, we'd have lower leverage which helps a lot in a downdraft.
So, we have in round numbers roughly $150 billion worth of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end
of the quarter. The biggest piece is – a quarter of that is office, 20% of that is apartments, 12% is industrial, 10%
is retail, excluding shopping centers, and then 9% is shopping centers, and everything else is below 9%, actually
hotels is about 8%, which is a volatile property type. And then, among nonaccrual loans, the shopping centers are
32%, hotels 14%, and retail excluding shopping centers is another 14%, and everything else is below 14%, and
there's about $1.3 billion of nonaccruals overall.
So, that's what it feels like. We're working through these things, borrower by borrower. Sometimes the
concessions that we're making are just covenant related. Sometimes they are real forbearance and we allow
28

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
people to take a little bit more time to pay our borrowers who have been generally calm and constructive. It's not a
lot of panic at this point in the cycle. The problem loans have skewed towards retail projects, many of which were
already struggling, and then also the hotel owners with lower capitalization. So, I hope that's helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. No. That is helpful. So, really you're reserving within community real estate – or you'd say that that
represents the similar stance for your overall portfolio, in other words, you're pretty much finished building
reserves there as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
For how we understand the world at the end of the second quarter, yes, and we think that's relatively – we think
it's very realistic. I should also add that in commercial real estate and elsewhere, our teams have gone loan by
loan, borrower by borrower and made an assessment of where we think we are and where we think things are
going. So, it's not just a modeled set of expectations, but real careful review of every borrower, every property and
their circumstances.

Okay. And then separately, when you think about the DFAST results and you're saying that you may perform
better than those results, I guess, where do you take exception with kind of how the Fed's modeling your stress
losses versus how you see them coming through this cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Forgive me, if I don't start the response by saying, we take exception with the Fed's results in the following
way, because that's not really – that won't be helpful. But they draw from different models and have different
approaches and we draw from our own, as I said, bottoms-up, our own modeled outcomes, our own historical
outcomes, changing the composition of the portfolio, changing underwriting standards since whatever we're
comparing it to and we end up with the numbers that we end up with.
I'm happy to note that I think in general, the Fed applies in general a lower loss rate for a variety of loan
categories to Wells Fargo than they have for some other lenders. It's not universally true based on the
composition of portfolios, but we like our numbers. We're a lot of work with a lot of very close inside knowledge of
borrowers, properties, et cetera, goes into it and it's being compared with something that's more statistically
driven from a model that we don't have access to.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Yeah. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hi, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Two quick things, one, just to – hi, to follow up on Matt's question. I mean just from 2017 to today, I mean your
revenue run rate went from $88 billion to roughly $70-ish billion and your core operating expenses have kind of
stayed flattish at $54-ish billion, let's say it. So, I mean sitting here on the outside, it would look like it's primarily a
revenue problem, not an expense problem. And I mean when you put out a number like $10 billion, are you
worried that that is going to like forego the optionality on capturing back that $18 billion in lost revenues or should
we assume that that's kind of gone?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
I think you should go back and listen to the words that we used to describe what the $10 billion is and how we're
thinking about this. Listen, there's no question in our minds that we should have the ability to generate higher
revenues in the future. No question that will help when it comes to an efficiency ratio. What we're talking about is

if you go back and look at where we were as a company versus the others, the others, the big companies that we
compete with have been working on this for 5 to 10 years and there is – and again, we're being very factual about
this, which you should go back and check yourself, which is there is this meaningful difference between what our
expense base looks like and theirs.
And then, I recognize you're on the outside, but what we're telling you is, on the inside, that we as a management
team continue to believe that the opportunities are substantial to improve the efficiency of the organization,
because we see it day in and day out, and we're going through a process to identify exactly what it is, where it is,
it's not just people, it's the third-party spend here is extraordinary, the things that we rely on outside people to do
is beyond anything that I've ever seen. Our ability to reduce facilities is substantial. And so, there's this long list of
things that we will actively be working on, whether that gets to $10 billion, whether it gets to more, whether it gets
to less, we'll see. We're going to share more as we develop the plans, but I think it's just important for us as a
management team to be very objective at what things looked like for this company before we wound up in today's
environment and those efficiencies clearly exist in the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Okay. And then, just a small thing, I thought I heard John say that you're no longer accepting home equity and
personal line of credit applications. And I mean I realize that those have been declining categories and that they
are not the kind of product lines today that they were before the Great Financial Crisis and all that. But still, aren't
those kind of sort of key products in a big consumer bank's arsenal and doesn't it send a wrong message to not
even take the applications?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, I guess, let me – I'll talk about a piece, John can talk about a piece. The way I'd think about it is, first of all,
we do offer personal lines in the company, because we have a credit card business. And so, for us, it's a question
of making sure that we've got the right product in front of the customer. And so, we think we have the ability to do
that. The home equity product, as you rightfully mentioned, has certainly declined in terms of the amount of
production that was taking place, but we do have to make a determination in the uncertain environment as to what
is a smart thing for us to participate in along with consumers as they add risk to their balance sheet. As time goes
on, if we feel differently about the environment and about real estate values, those decisions could change as
well.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, Charlie. Hi, John. A couple of questions, thanks for taking them. Firstly, Charlie, are you still on track to be
giving us some kind of strategic review or strategic plan towards the end of the year or should we expect that with
the cost details that you're going to give us in the third quarter, how are you thinking in terms of timing of the two
things?

Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hi. I think as we – between the third and fourth quarter, we're looking at getting both done to share the complete –
our complete set of thoughts with you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So, you'll give them – you'll give it to us simultaneously, so that we can see how the two fit together?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Again, I think that's what we're targeting, but we'll have to see how it plays out and our work progresses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. In that same vein, Charlie, as you're thinking about all of this, you talk about having too much of an
expense dollar relative to your peers. How much of this where you find businesses where it's because you just
don't have enough scale on the revenue side? Are you thinking you're going to exit some of those businesses?
What are you thinking there? Are you thinking about more business exits, any thoughts on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. That's a good question, Vivek. And I think we've talked about this a little bit over the last couple of quarters.
There absolutely are some things that we do which either we don't have scale in or it just might not be big enough
to have an impact on the company going forward and it's not clear that it's integral to us being able to fulfill the
primary banking relationships that we have from the consumer to the small business and middle-market up to the
corporate. So, I think as we think about what the company should look like, we absolutely are looking at those
things. And so, we certainly expect that we would continue to – I think John has used the word prune some of
these things that exist inside the company as we've been doing. I don't think about them in terms of – to say it
differently, the five lines of business that we've determined, we do believe are key to the future of the company,
but when you go below that, there's certainly some activities which might not meet our criteria for continuing to be
here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then, when you give us these combined reviews, will you give us some sense of we've been – we've
heard about need to spend more on technology areas that you're behind in, will you give us some sense also
where that stands business by business and what you need to do and how that sort of dovetails with the numbers,
too?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Listen, we'll see when we get closer to the level of detail that we go through with you, but certainly, the work that
we're doing contemplates the fact that we don't want to stand still in our businesses.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles Peabody Q
Analyst, Portales Partners, LLC
Good afternoon and thank you. Two questions, one, and I apologize if you've already covered this, but I
transitioned over late from the Citigroup call. What were the variables that went into your thinking on the level of
the dividend? I mean was it this was a level that you didn't have to worry about it again, was it a function of what
you think your core earnings power is going forward or is it desire to build capital? What were the variables that
got you to that level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
A handful of things, of course, and with the expectation that it's likely that the right constraints on the calculation of
allowable dividend hang around for a while, even though they may not, but they certainly may, we found a level
that we believe is something that gives us more of an upside ability as the COVID environment clears up, as the
medium-term earnings power of the company becomes more known, both in terms of sources of revenue and
what's happening with expense, et cetera, so that we wouldn't end up or have a low likelihood of ending up in an
environment where you're making repeated changes to the dividend. So, not so much about – our capital levels
are fine, we have $23-ish-billion of excess on top of our regulatory capital requirement and we feel it's gone up, as
you may have observed, and that's even after building a $20 billion allowance. So, not so much capital
sufficiency, although in the future, it could turn out differently than we and others are planning right now, but really
more about thinking about the core earnings power and a resulting upward trajectory when the time is right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
And so, I would just add, I know we certainly appreciate the multiple calls that are going on today and it's a busy
day for you all, I'd encourage you to go back and look at the prepared remarks, because we did walk through the
thinking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles Peabody Q
Analyst, Portales Partners, LLC
Okay. Thank you. And as a follow-up question, there's a June 22 letter from 40 or 50, 60 Congressmen on both
sides of the aisle, so bipartisan, and it's addressed to Mnuchin and Powell, and in this letter they warn of the
looming crisis in the CRE and particularly the CMBS market and they ask for help from the Treasury and the Fed.
I was curious what actions you think they might be thinking about taking to support the CMBS market or what
actions would you like to see them to take?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
I don't know that we have an opinion on what actions we'd like to see them take. I do think that as between the
risk owners and CMBS transactions and servicers and borrowers, people should be looking to maximize recovery
value, but the contracts are pretty thoughtful. This isn't the first downturn that those market participants have been

through and my expectation is that a lot of decision-making power is going to end up in the hands of special
servicers and I don't know how to – I don't know why it would be a good idea to impose some other regime on top
of that that changes those contracts. But I don't have a careful thoughtful review of what's being proposed.

Operator: Our final question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hello, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Hi, John. I apologize if you touched on this already, but when you guys gave us in slide 2 – or I'm
sorry, slide 3, the number of customers you've helped with deferring payments and waiving fees, can you give us
some color on the trend in terms of the applications for these deferrals? I assume they were very heavy early on
and they've faded downwards.
And then second, how many of the customers that have come up for renewal have actually asked for a second
extension for the deferrals?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, it's different by loan category, and yes, it's true that the people additionally asking, there's sort of a high
point, we peaked – our peak was the second week in April, I think on average we had about 60,000 to 70,000
accounts per day who were asking. We dropped almost entirely, I think we're at 4,000 a day for the week of late
June, so if that's helpful.
And of course, the extension question is related to how long was the initial deferral to begin with and in general, I
would say that more people are getting comfortable with coming out the other side, but yet we still have a good
base of folks who are in deferral.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And then second, John, have you guys gotten any color from the Fed on how long they're going to be supportive
of the industry, yourselves included, in granting these deferrals without having to reclassify the loans and put
more capital against them?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
I don't think we've got a specific conclusion on that, although we do assume that there's going to be some point in
time after which whether it's the regulators, not only the Fed and/or our accounting convention is going to cause

us to have to consider these as something other than a performing loan. It might be different by category, it might
be different by regulator, but the longer we go on, the greater the risk of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Lastly, thank you again for the great detail that you guys give in your commercial and industrial loan
portfolio, and I noticed as you mentioned, the increase in nonaccruals on page 17, the different categories. Can
you give us some color, on the real estate and construction, the nonaccruals went to $290 million up from I guess
it was $49 million in the prior quarter, how much was construction versus loans to the non-depository financials?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Shrewsberry A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
I don't think I have the breakout in front of me, but I can have the IR team follow-up with you.

Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, great. No. I appreciate it, John. Thank you.
