Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. This morning, we
reported strong third quarter earnings of $446 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.49. For the third
quarter, total revenue grew on a reported and adjusted basis as both net interest income and fee revenue

improved quarter-over-quarter. In fact, almost every category within fee revenue experienced growth compared to
the second quarter.
In line with the growth in revenue, adjusted non-interest expense increased modestly quarter-over-quarter.
Average loans remained stable while ending loans declined slightly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting modest
customer demand, continued focus on client selectivity, as well as further paydowns and credit resolutions in the
portfolio.
In general, sentiment among corporate customers remains cautiously optimistic. Despite recent interest rate cuts
and the possibility of more, customers are hesitant to make capital expenditures until the resolution of the
election, along with the greater economic and geopolitical [ph] certainty (00:02:20). Our focus remains on
understanding our customers' evolving needs and providing tailored solutions to ensure we are well-positioned to
support them when the time is right.
Average deposits declined slightly while ending deposits remained stable during the quarter, as deposit remixing
trends have stabilized. Although certain portfolios within the corporate bank continued to experience stress,
overall, our corporate and consumer customers remain healthy and our credit metrics have stabilized.
Before wrapping up, I want to take a moment to speak about the recent hurricanes, Helene and Milton. They were
incredibly powerful storms and the impacted communities across our footprint faced difficult challenges as they
begin the recovery process. I'm extremely proud of the way our teams are responding to meet the needs of our
customers, fellow associates, and communities affected. Regions has a long history of helping communities
through challenging times, including natural disasters, and we'll continue to support the recovery efforts.
In summary, we're proud of our third quarter results driven by the successful execution of our strategic plan. Our
highly desirable footprint, along with the investments we're making in talent, in technology, and in products and
services, are positioning us to benefit as macroeconomic conditions improve. We have a great plan and a
leadership team with a proven track record of successful execution. We're on track for a strong finish to 2024 and
are well-positioned to continue generating top quartile results in 2025 and beyond.
Now, David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average loans remained stable while ending loans declined
slightly on a sequential quarter basis. Within the business portfolio, average loans remained stable quarter-over-
quarter.
As John mentioned, pipelines are likely to remain soft as customers continue to seek more certainty on a handful
of fronts. In addition, customers continue to carry excess liquidity and utilization rates remain below historic levels.
Average consumer loans also remained stable, as modest growth in credit card was offset by declines in other
categories. We continue to expect 2024 average loans to be stable to down modestly compared to 2023.
From a deposit standpoint, deposit balances followed the expectations this quarter. Ending levels were stable and
averages were down about 1%, largely due to normal summer spending among consumers. Competitive rates
declined in advance of the Fed rate cut and, consequently, customer demand for CDs softened, further slowing
the rate seeking behavior we experienced throughout the cycle. As a result, the percentage of non-interest-
bearing deposits remained stable in the low-30% range.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Let's shift to net interest income. Net interest income increased 3% linked quarter, outperforming our
expectations. The increase reflects stability in deposit trends, together with asset yield expansion. Year-to-date,
we have repositioned $3.6 billion of securities, realizing $175 million of pre-tax losses, resulting in an estimated
2.5 year payback. This includes incremental sale and reinvestment of approximately $1.3 billion of securities in
the third quarter at a $75 million pre-tax loss.
Importantly, the strategy of selling shorter-duration and buying longer-duration securities has been helpful in
maintaining our duration target and has benefited the unrealized loss on the portfolio as interest rates moved
lower in the third quarter. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate further repositioning with respect to risk
management and capital goals. However, near-term opportunities with attractive payback periods are limited
given current market dynamics.
Similar to the second quarter transaction, the proceeds of $1 billion September debt issuance were used to
purchase a like amount of securities in order to maintain a relatively neutral balance sheet position and bolster
liquidity. As expected, interest-bearing deposit costs have peaked, remaining flat with the second quarter level at
2.34%. This completes the full rising rate cycle with our interest-bearing deposit beta finishing at 43%, while also
maintaining 30% more deposit balances than held prior to the pandemic. Once again, highlighting the funding
advantage of Regions industry leading deposit franchise.
Now, as we transition to a falling rate environment, hedging and the ability to reduce deposit expense result in a
well-protected profile. Following the initial Fed funds decline, we've experienced a reduction in interest-bearing
deposit rates and our exit rate for the quarter amounted to 2.2%, consistent with a roughly 30% beta. In the fourth
quarter, we would expect further benefit from deposits as term products begin to mature and price lower, equating
to a mid-30s beta and neutral sensitivity position in the quarter.
Over time, we believe falling rate deposit betas have the ability to drift higher toward those experienced in the
rising rate cycle. When coupled with fixed rate asset turnover at higher market yields, this provides the support to
grow net interest income in the fourth quarter and beyond.
Let's take a look at fee revenue performance during the quarter. Adjusted non-interest income increased 9%,
driven by improvement in almost every category, most notably, service charges, capital markets and wealth
management. Service charges increased 5% driven primarily by treasury management semi-annual fees, as well
as the benefit of one additional business day in the quarter. Capital markets increased 35% due to the increase in
M&A advisory fees, as well as an increased securities underwriting and placement fees driven by market
stabilization.
Over time and in a more favorable interest rate environment, we expect our capital markets business can
consistently generate quarterly revenue of approximately $100 million, but we expect it will run around $80 million
to $90 million in the fourth quarter. Wealth management increased 5% to a new quarterly record, reflecting
increased sales activity and stronger markets. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect full year 2024
adjusted non-interest income to be in the $2.45 billion to $2.5 billion range.
Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 4% compared to the prior
quarter, driven primarily by a 6% increase in salaries and benefits, resulting from one additional day in the
quarter, increased performance based incentives, and the impact of HR-related asset valuations. The company
also recognized $14 million of expense during the quarter associated with Visa's ongoing litigation escrow related
to their Class B shares.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
We remain committed to prudently managing expenses to fund investments in our business. We will continue
focusing on our largest expense categories, which include salaries and benefits, occupancy, and vendor spend.
Based on year-to-date results, including outperformance in revenue and elevated HR asset valuations, we now
expect full year 2024 adjusted non-interest expenses to be approximately $4.25 billion.
Regarding asset quality, as John indicated, overall credit performance continued to stabilize during the quarter.
And importantly, our results include the impact of the recently completed SNC exam. Provision expense was $4
million less than net charge-offs at $113 million, and the resulting allowance for credit loss ratio increased 1 basis
point to 1.79%. As expected, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans increased 6 basis points to 48
basis points, driven primarily by large information credit and one office credit.
Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans declined 2 basis points to 85 basis points, and business
services criticized loans declined $171 million. We continue to expect full year 2024 net charge-offs to be towards
the upper end of our 40 to 50 basis point range, attributable to a few large credits within our previously identified
portfolios of interest. However, those losses are substantially reserved for.
Let's turn to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter with an estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.6%,
while executing $101 million in share repurchases and $229 million in common dividends during the quarter.
When adjusted to include AOCI, Common Equity Tier 1 increased meaningfully from 8.2% to an estimated 9.1%
from the second to the third quarter. The improvement reflects the benefit of AOCI from lower interest rates and
our active management of the duration of the securities portfolio.
Additionally, near the end of the third quarter, we transferred $2.5 billion of available-for-sale securities to held-to-
maturity as an initial step to reduce the volatility of AOCI as we transition towards new regulatory expectations in
the future. We expect to maintain our reported Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, consistent with current levels over the
near term. This level will provide meaningful capital flexibility going forward to meet proposed and evolving
regulatory changes, along with the implementation timeline, while supporting strategic growth objectives and
allowing us to continue to increase the dividend and repurchase shares commensurate with earnings.
With that, we'll move to the Q&A portion of the call.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please
hold while we compile the Q&A roster. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with
Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Morning, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning, everybody. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. David, I was hoping you could sort of
touch on some of the nuance within NII momentum. And I guess, I'll ask just the first and then a follow-up
question all kind of wrapped into one. I think you've previously suggested the margin could push up closer to like
3.60% as we enter next year and then kind of advance from there over the next couple of years. It feels like the
fourth quarter might take a little bit of a step back. Does that knock us off the track for the 3.60% and prior path?
And then, the follow on is, regardless, it still feels as if NII will remain on an upward trajectory. So, any updated
thoughts on how the pacing looks over the next few periods?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure. Yes, Scott. I think the – we're still intact with regards to that 3.60%. I do think we'll be in the in the lower part
of the 3.50s in the fourth quarter, we're going to grow a little bit in terms of NII as indicated. And then, going into
2025, we still have benefit from the front book, back book that's going to benefit us. We've had a little bit of
earning asset growth, too. And continuing to control our deposit cost. And of course, we have our derivatives that
naturally reset. Those are a negative carry this past quarter of about $110 million. And so, as rates come down,
that certainly helps offset lowering rates. So, it gives us confidence that we can go into next year and grow the
margin.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning. Just first, on the loan growth side, I guess if you could just give us a little more color what you're
seeing in terms of loan demand? I know you indicated that utilization is running below historical levels. And given
that, what do you see as the catalyst really to be driving a material pickup? And maybe, how do you think about
that pickup materializing when you look at either fourth quarter or 2025? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we've said our customers are cautiously optimistic. I would say, the environment's generally a positive
one. The economy is still good, though slowing. We've seen some growth in middle market commercial in our
energy portfolio and asset-based lending. Some of that is offset by declines in the real estate book as projects are
maturing, and particularly in the multifamily space paying off which offsets some of the growth we're experiencing
on the business side. We've had a little growth in credit card balances and in our inter-bank originations. That's
somewhat offset by declines in mortgages we experienced and some paydowns there.
So, I think activity is okay. Pipelines are softer than they were last quarter, but we still feel like we will see some
modest possibly growth in loans in 2025. As there's more certainty about the political environment, as there's
more certainty about the continued direction of the economy, prices begin to moderate a bit. Businesses are still
doing well, balance sheets are strong, margins are compressing, but customers are still making good money, and
we think they'll want to invest in their business when it's more clear. We see – have a more clear path in – later in
2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. John, it's David. I would add that our expectation is for real GDP to be in the 2% – little over 2% range in
2025. We obviously are in great markets and we think we can take advantage of those when the – a little bit of
this uncertainty that John just mentioned dissipates a bit, and then get on the growth trajectory in 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Great. Thank you for that. And then, separately, on the expense side, can you maybe talk about your confidence
in your upwardly revised expense expectations here? I guess, barring the outperformance of revenue on the fee
side, do you see other risks that could pressure expenses higher again beyond revenue related? And then, how
does that influence your expectation for a positive operating leverage next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure. No, once you get to this close to the year, the expense estimate, we're pretty tight on that. We just don't see
anything that can take us out of the – what we've given you from an estimate standpoint. And we're set up, we've
done a good job of managing our expenses, it's an everyday thing for us. We continue to look at expense savings
opportunities because we want to use some of those savings to reinvest in our business, to continue to grow,
which sets us up for growth in 2025. And, yes, we will generate positive operating leverage in 2025. So, we kind
of don't see anything that's really could create major uncertainty in the fourth quarter in particular.

John M. Turner, Jr. A

that we're making. We have a big technology project underway, as you know. We believe that project is on track,
on budget. And so, don't have a lot of concern about that at the moment either.

with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I guess, first question around credit. I think, David, you mentioned the charge-offs towards the
higher end sectors you've talked about. Just maybe if we look forward, given where the economy today is, where
your customer base is, do you think that charge-offs remain sticky in that 40 to 50 bps range? Or do we actually
see a stair step function decline at some point over the coming quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ebrahim, we look back at our historic performance, it's been kind of an average of 46 basis points of
charge-offs prior to the pandemic. And we've indicated, we think based upon the composition of our portfolio, that
our charge-offs will range somewhere between 40 and 50 basis points on average. There may be a quarter where
they're modestly higher because of large exposures, maybe a quarter where they're lower because of better
performance, particularly in the business portfolio. But we are seeing really good consumer credit performance
right now and feel good about that. And again, based upon the composition of our portfolio and our historical
performance, we think that 40 to 50 basis point range is pretty typical.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. And I guess, just one question maybe for David around deposit pricing. I'm just wondering, did the
signaling by the Fed with the first 50 basis point rate cut give enough ammunition to actually flex deposit costs
lower, even if assuming we don't get a November cut or do you think every incremental rate cut is much needed
in order to be able to bring deposit costs lower?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
David Jackson Turner A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
No, I think you should continue to expect the deposit costs to decline into the fourth quarter. We have several
things working, some maturing CDs that are in that 4.25%, 4.50% range going on, today, closer to 4%. We had an
exit rate we put in the script interest-bearing cost being 2.20%. So, if you look at where we were for the quarter, it
was 2.34%. So, that gives you the indication you should continue to see the benefit of that coming down even if
we don't get another cut. Now, obviously, more cuts would be even further reduction in costs. But you also have
to factor in the re-investment yields on the asset side, too. So, we think we're well-positioned. Back to the first
question that we got from Scott in terms of the NII, we think we can continue to grow NII and the resulting margin
in the fourth quarter and into 2025.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Morning. David, I'm sorry for another question on deposit repricing. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of,
the cadence over the next several quarters. So, obviously, some of the maturing retail and indexed deposits will
reprice more immediately. How should we think about, once the easy stuff has repriced, how we can look forward
to deposit repricing going forward? And maybe think us through if – we haven't seen a neutral rate that wasn't
zero in such a long time. What is your typical deposit spread when the neutral rate has a level like 2.75% and
3%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, there's several questions baked into there. So, if you look at maturities, that was the first part of your
question, we have [ph] right at (00:24:37) $3 billion that will be maturing here in the fourth quarter between our
retail customers, which is probably $2.5 billion of that number, and then we got some wealth and small business
customers.

We're not seeing the flight for yield as much as we had been. And so, that's dissipating. And as I mentioned
earlier, our CDs of 4.25% to 4.50% that are maturing, new rates for CDs are closer to 4%, still trying to keep the
duration tight. I guess, the average is probably closer to five months now with this expectation. If rates were going
to come down, we would have an opportunity to take care of it.
From a money market standpoint, you can see a lot of the deposit shift that came out of NIB went into money
market. We can continue to challenge those rates pretty quickly. And so – and I think we have a mechanism to be
able to adjust our rates pretty quickly. At 3% Fed funds, we're talking about deposit costs in the 1% range, so
couple of hundred basis points spread between those two, I think...

have always hit the right balance of efficiency and investment.
As we think about the setup for next year, David mentioned the NII trajectory, if we remove the election
uncertainty, I suspect that your fees will benefit as well in 2025. Should we calibrate our expectation for expenses

relative to revenue rather than just resetting it flat to up 1% or whatever it is? In other words, should the Street just
expect, okay, what can Regions generate revenue-wise in a better environment and just expect positive operating
leverage from there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think, at the end of the day, we're committing to positive operating leverage in 2025. A lot of what we do is
we look at the revenue generation we're going to have. We have our core expenses we're constantly challenging,
and we're trying to figure out how much we can free up for investment. Because the more we can free up an
investment, it's not just technology and cyber or consumer compliance, it's people, it's putting more people on –
more boots on the ground in the markets that we want to continue grow in. But we have, obviously, a cap in terms
of how much we can do based on the revenue generation that we have. So, we need to generate positive
operating leverage. We think that creates shareholder value over time. And if we can generate more revenue,
then we can use a bigger piece of the expense base to make those investments, but that's where it gets
calibrated to come back to generate positive operating leverage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
I would just add, Erika, we're committed to finding ways to eliminate expenses to use those monies to finance
investments in our business. And if you look at treasury management as an example, we've grown relationships
by 5% year-over-year and revenues up 18% year-over-year. In wealth management, where we've been adding
some wealth bankers and we expect to do that again next year, relationships are up 9%. And assets under
management are up 9%. We finally have, I think, capital markets back on track and that business is continuing to
grow. It's been a great growth story for us since 2014 when we began expanding our capabilities there. Mortgage
is an area where we're making some investment as we believe that business will improve. And then, small
business, we think, is an opportunity across our footprint. So, we believe we have a number of pathways to grow
and we intend to finance the investment in that growth through eliminating expenses that will allow us to make
those investments.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Good morning. I was wondering if you guys could talk about the card and ATM fee line. I know it's just a few
million dollars down 2Q and it's not like all that impactful to the overall picture, but it was down and I was just
looking how it's been down six of the past seven quarters year-over-year. And just remind us what's going on
there? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Matt, that's – so you want to pick on the only one that didn't grow? Okay. [ph] It's killing (00:29:50) me.
That's just really a volume thing and a mix between credit and debit, and it depends on what season you're in.
You can get a little bit of noise and all that. There's nothing systemic there that shouldn't enable us to grow that
over time. So, there's not a big story there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And it does seem like the risk of debit card interchange reform has quieted down. So, is that a line item that
you're hopeful of growing in the future?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, the way to grow that is to continue to grow customers. And so, we focus on growing checking
accounts. And the more checking accounts we get, the more cards we have in people's hands. And I think, again,
being in the markets that we're in are going to give us the opportunity to do that, especially as we invest in people
that I just talked about. So, yeah, I think that's opportunity to grow.
You do point out that there is a risk there in terms of the debit interchange rules, if that goes through. It has
quieted down. We don't know that it – there's no law that says it has to change at all from where it is right now.
So, we're going to continue to monitor that. But right now, we don't count that as something that'll happen in 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. And Matt, I'd just remind you that, when we've talked about this before, Visa publishes the power score,
which is a reflection of consumer customers' debit utilization – activation and utilization. And for 42 quarters in a
row now, Regions' customer base has been first in terms of power score. We have a customer base that very
actively uses their cards, particularly debit cards. And so, to David's point, as long as we can continue to grow
households, put more cards in customers' hands, we believe that there's plenty of opportunity to grow fee revenue
associated with that category.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
All right. That's helpful. Thank you very much.

John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thank you.

Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Morning, Betsy. Hey, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Yeah, a couple of cleanups here. One, just we – I know we talked a lot about deposit rates. And I'm
wondering what's the implication for deposit growth and how are you thinking about that, because it's the fuel for
the balance sheet obviously?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, it gets back to, again, being in the markets that we're in, a lot of migration of people and businesses into
our markets. We're making investments in people. And our core strategy of our company has been focusing on
growth in checking accounts of a consumer in wealth and operating accounts of a business, including small
business where we're really kind of putting more effort on that than we have in the past. We're up about 30%
since the pre-pandemic in terms of deposits, since 2019. And so, we think we have a good opportunity to grow.
We have to be competitive with rates, Betsy. I mean, we're not trying to just be the low cost provider. We're trying
to be fair and balanced, and we think we've done that. And so, we're going to have our opportunity to grow. And
then – and on the corporate banking side, we've managed about $8 billion of cash off balance sheet for our
customers, and we're not paying the rate that they would want. We get it for them and we get a little fee for it. But
if we ever needed the liquidity for that, we could increase our rates and grow there. But we haven't had to do that.
What we want to do is make sure we're balancing deposit growth and loan growth to maximize our net interest
margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Sure. Okay. No, that's helpful color and appreciate the $8 billion there in the corporate banking. The other
question I just had is, on the investment spend in capital markets specifically, is there anything in capital markets
that you're thinking about investing more in to power that line? And what I'm thinking about, I'm wondering is, the
private credit piece of the ecosystem here does continue to grow and there are opportunities for banks to
originate – help originate source, structure, et cetera, and I'm wondering is that an area that you would be looking
to invest in or you would say, absolutely not, there's other things that we're focused on? Thanks.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
I think we're following the developments in the private credit space, and there are a couple of different models that
are emerging. They're all new, and so we'll follow that with some interest, but we don't have any specific
inclination at this point. Much of what we're seeing so far in the way of private credit origination in our markets are
things that we're not interested in doing. So, higher leverage, less covenants, just originations that don't interest
us at this point. But again, we're following that development closely.
In terms of capital markets, we've made some great investments. We want to continue to optimize those, seeing
the benefits, as an example, of our investment in small and real estate originations placement revenue.
Separately, our M&A advisory platforms, both Clearsight and BlackArch, are doing well. I think we have some
opportunity to take advantage of the investments we've made and to look to potentially add some capabilities
around the fringes, either add-ons to those businesses or potentially some fixed income sales and trading
capabilities over time. But we don't have any burning desire to do anything but – other than execute well on the
investments that we've made so far.
