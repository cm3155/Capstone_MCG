Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Good morning. Thanks for joining us to discuss BOK Financial's fourth quarter and 2022's full-year financial
results.
Starting on slide 4, fourth quarter net income was $168 million or $2.51 per diluted share. The strong results of
the fourth quarter continue to build on the earnings momentum we have been developing throughout 2022 with
the highest pre-provision net revenue in our history. Through the fourth quarter, we've now put together five
straight quarters with solid core loan growth, with annualized core loan growth of 13%.
Our fee business has remained strong for the quarter and for the year, despite the worst combined equity and
fixed income markets since the late 1960s. As short-term interest rates continued to rise during the quarter, the
combination of our asset sensitive balance sheet and growth in earning assets drove a $36 million increase in net
interest revenue and a 30-basis-point linked quarter increase in the net interest margin. Credit also goes to our
diverse fee base, with linked quarter fees stable despite the full quarter impact of implementation of previously
announced changes to our customer overdraft program, as well as the continued effects of the mortgage
origination market downturn.
We did experience an increase in linked quarter net charge-offs. However, our asset quality trends remain
unsustainably good. In recognition of the strong growth in loans and unfunded commitments during the quarter,
we did add to our credit loss reserve. The uncertainty in the economic outlook remained high, with slightly less
favorable key economic factors this quarter.
Turning to slide 5, period-end core loan balances increased $773 million or 3.5% linked quarter, with growth
spread across C&I and commercial real estate. Unfunded loan commitments grew $839 million linked quarter and
have increased $2.9 billion over the last 12 months. Utilization rates remain slightly below historical norms, so
capacity exists for continued growth in outstanding balances.
Average deposit volumes continue to remain high compared to pre-pandemic levels. We did experience a
decrease of $1.6 billion or 4% this quarter with attrition in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing balances.
These declines were consistent with industry trends in response to the continued efforts of the Federal Reserve to
move short-term rates higher to slow inflation trends. Assets under management or administration grew $4.3
billion or 4.5% linked quarter and were down $5.2 billion or 4.9% compared to last year. The market impact on
equities this year, which comprise approximately a third of the total, was partially offset with new sales driving the
performance.
I'll provide additional perspective on the results before starting the Q&A session. But now, Marc Maun will review
the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail. I'll turn the call over to Marc.

Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Stacy.
Turning to slide 7, period-end loans in our core loan portfolio were $22.5 billion, up 3.5% linked quarter. Total C&I
loans increased $591 million or 4.3% linked quarter and have increased $1.7 billion or 13.5% for the year with
growth across all sectors. Unfunded C&I commitments increased 7.4% in linked quarter.
Commercial real estate loans increased to $133 million or 3% linked quarter and have increased $775 million or
20% for the year. This effectively returns those balances to our 2020 level after experiencing significant pay down
activity in 2021. The annual increase was primarily driven from loans secured by multifamily residential properties

and industrial facilities. Unfunded commercial real estate commitments increased 4.9% linked quarter. We take a
disciplined approach to our CRE lending by allocating 185% of Tier 1 capital and reserves to total CRE
commitments. We are presently at the upper limit of that commitment range, but do expect outstanding CRE
balances to grow in 2023 as construction loans spunned out.
Healthcare balances increased slightly this quarter up $18 million or 0.5%, but have increased $430 million or
12.6% for the year, primarily driven by our senior housing sector. Healthcare unfunded commitments increased
16% linked quarter, which we expect will produce additional balanced growth.
Energy balances increased $53 million or 1.6% linked quarter and have increased $418 million or 13.9% year-
over-year. Unfunded commitments increased 9.6% linked quarter, resulting in an average utilization rate of
approximately 49%, creating more capacity for continued balance sheet growth.
General business loans recorded a strong quarter, with balances increasing $368 million or 11.8% linked quarter.
Loans in the general business category are mainly from our wholesale and retail sectors.
Loans in our services sector also increased with balances up $151 million or 4.6% linked quarter. Service sector
loans consist of a large number of loans to a variety of businesses, including Native American, tribal and state
and local governments, as well as tribal casino operations, foundations, not-for-profit organizations, educational
services and specialty trade contractors.
Combined services and general business loans have increased $844 million or 15.9% year-over-year. Unfunded
commitments in these combined services and general business categories increased 4.4% linked quarter, slightly
lowering utilization rates. Utilization rates continue to run below pre-COVID levels. So, we remain well positioned
to increase outstanding loan balances without it being predicated on any new customer acquisition.
Over the last 12 months, core loans have grown $2.6 billion or 13%, the largest annual dollar increase in our
history, excluding acquisitions and PPP loans. Although we don't expect loan growth to continue at this pace, we
believe that the momentum we've experienced over the past five quarters will continue as we entered 2023 and
customers increase their line utilization.
Turning to slide 8, you can see that credit quality continues to be exceptionally good across the loan portfolio.
Nonperforming assets, excluding those guaranteed by US government agencies, decreased $22 million this
quarter. Non-accrual loans decreased $9 million, and repossessed assets fell $15 million.
In consideration of strong growth and outstanding loan balances and unfunded commitments this quarter, we
added $15 million to our provision for expected credit losses. The level of uncertainty in the economic outlook of
our reasonable and supportable forecast remained high, and key economic factors were slightly less favorable to
economic growth across all scenarios, with our downside for cash probability weighting unchanged linked quarter
at 40%.
Given our solid credit position today, the ratio of capital allocated commercial real estate, that's substantially less
than our peers and a history of outperformance during past credit cycles, we believe we are well positioned
should an economic slowdown materialize in the quarters ahead.
We realized net charge-offs of $15.5 million during the fourth quarter, essentially all related to a single credit. For
the full year, net charge-offs averaged 10 basis points, which is far below our historic loss range of 30 to 40 basis
points. Looking forward, we expect net charge-offs to continue to be low.

The combined allowance for credit losses was $297 million or 1.31% of outstanding loans at quarter end. We
expect to maintain this ratio or to migrate slightly upward as we expect strong loan growth to continue well as
continue economic uncertainty due to market conditions as the Fed pursues their goal of reducing inflation. Both
of these conditions support credit provisions going forward.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.

Thanks, Marc.
Turning to slide 10, total fees and commissions were $194 million for the fourth quarter, relatively unchanged from
last quarter. However, the third quarter included record high results for our commodity and hedging activities, as
well as our bank-wide investment banking activities.
Trading fees increased $9 million linked quarter as we took advantage of favorable market conditions and
increased market volatility. Our commodity and hedging activities declined $4.7 million from last quarter's record
high with linked quarter declines in both energy and interest rate derivatives. Bank-wide investment banking
activities fell $2.4 million from last quarter's record high. Commercial loan syndication fees increased $2.3 million
linked quarter, offset by a $4.7 million decrease in other investment banking fees, primarily fees from our
municipal investment banking segment.
The combination of our investment banking and customer hedging activities from our wealth and commercial
segments generated $91 million in fee income for the year, an increase of $36 million or 67% compared to 2021.
Fiduciary and asset management fees were $50 million for the fourth quarter, relatively flat linked quarter. For the
year, these fees increased $18 million or 10%, primarily due to reduced fund fee waivers driven by the increase in
short-term interest rates, as well as market driven increases to our oil and gas fees. Our assets under
management or administration finished the year at $99.7 billion, an increase of $4.3 billion or 4.5% linked quarter
with growth across all categories. Our asset mix for assets under management or administration was relatively
unchanged this quarter, with 45% fixed income; 32% equities; 14% cash; and 9% alternatives. Deposit service
charges decreased $2.3 million this quarter, primarily related to the changes we implemented during the quarter
to our overdraft program.
Commercial service charges also decreased slightly as we increased the earnings credit rate for our customers.
Mortgage banking revenue was $10 million for the quarter, down slightly linked quarter, with production revenues
down $1.6 million due to a $119 million decline in production volumes combined with narrowing margins.
Mortgage servicing fees increased slightly this quarter and are 25% higher than fourth quarter last year. Over the
past 18 months, we strategically acquired servicing of approximately $6 billion of unpaid principal balances that
will add $15 million of annual servicing revenue.
I'll now turn over the call to Steven to highlight our net interest margin dynamics and the important balance sheet
items for the quarter. Steven?

Thanks, Scott.
Turning to slide 12, fourth quarter net interest revenue was $353 million, a $36 million increase linked quarter.
The rapid increase in interest rates, combined with our strong loan growth in our asset sensitive position, resulted
in a linked quarter net interest margin expansion from 3.24% to 3.54%. This was partially offset by the expansion
of our securities portfolio, which slightly dilutes the margin, but increases net interest revenue. The average
effective rate on interest-bearing deposits increased 59 basis points this quarter, bringing our total deposit beta to
32% for the year.
Average earning assets increase $757 million compared to the last quarter. The average available for sale
security portfolio increased $648 million this quarter as we increase that portfolio, $1.5 billion linked quarter to
pivot back towards a more neutral interest rate position. Average loans increased $377 million while cash and
cash equivalents fell $180 million.
On slide 13, you can see that our liquidity position remains very strong. Our loan-to-deposit ratio increased to
65.4% this quarter from 59.8% at September 30. Total deposits decreased $1.9 billion and loan balances
increased $767 million this quarter. Although increasing our current loan-to-deposit ratio remains well below the
pre-pandemic level of 78.7% at year-end 2019, providing sufficient on-balance sheet liquidity to meet future
customer loan demand.
Our capital position remains strong as well with a Common Equity Tier-1 ratio of 11.7%, well above regulatory
thresholds. It is notable that even with our strong loan growth and material unrealized losses in our available for
sale securities portfolio, our tangible common equity ratio remained strong at 7.63%. Both the holding company
and the bank hold investment grade ratings from all three major rating agencies.
With such strong capital levels, we once again were active with share repurchase, opportunistically repurchasing
314,000 shares in the average price of $103.14 per share in the open market. We expect to be active in
repurchasing shares over the next four quarters.
Turning to slide 14, linked quarter total expenses increased $24 million, $16 million from personnel and $8 million
from non-personnel expense. $10 million of the personnel expense is from cash-based compensation due to
increased sales activity, combined with a onetime employee incentive. Deferred compensation expense, which is
directly influenced by market valuations, increased $5 million. The linked quarter increase in non-personnel
expense was primarily driven by increased professional fees and business promotion spend, as well as a
contribution to the BOKF charitable foundation.
I'll now turn over the call to Marty Grunst, our incoming CFO, who will provide our forward guidance. Marty?

Martin E. Grunst

Thanks, Steven.
Turning to slide 16, I'll cover our expectations for 2023. We expect mid to upper single digit annualized loan
growth. The economy and our geographic footprint remains very strong and may outperform in this cycle, given
the high level of business in migration from other markets. Sizable increases in unfunded commitments during
2022 and low levels of line utilization should be an additional tailwind for loan growth.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
During the fourth quarter of 2022, we added $1.5 billion to our available for sale securities portfolio to move us
closer to an interest rate neutral position. We expect to hold the portfolio at this higher level in 2023.
We have a strong base of core deposits and expect modest attrition in interest-bearing and demand deposits to
move our loan-to-deposit ratio somewhat higher, while still remaining below historical levels.
Currently, we are assuming 25-basis-point increases in February and March before the Federal Reserve pauses.
We believe the margin will migrate modestly lower in the first half of 2023, as interest-bearing deposit betas
increase, demand deposit balance attrition runs its course and our interest rate position is more balanced.
The December net interest margin was 3.57%. Net interest income is expected to approach $1.4 billion in total for
2023.
In aggregate, we expect total fees and commissions revenue to approach $750 million for 2023. We expect
expenses to be below Q4 2022 levels in the short term, migrating back towards this level throughout 2023. We
continue to expect revenue growth to outpace expense growth resulting in an efficiency ratio, which remains
below 60%, nearing 57% by year-end 2023.
Our allowance level is slightly above the median of our peers, and we expect to maintain a strong credit reserve.
Given our expectations for loan growth and the strength of our credit quality, we expect quarterly provisions
similar to the second half of 2022. Current asset quality is very strong and does not foreshadow material
deterioration. Changes in the economic outlook will, of course, impact our provision expense. And we expect to
continue our quarterly share repurchases, as Steven noted earlier.
I'll now turn the call back over to Stacy Kymes for closing commentary.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Marty.
The strong fourth quarter results, in fact, earnings for the year demonstrate how the bank was positioned for
earnings growth in this rising rate environment. We leaned in to becoming more asset sensitive, given the unique
nature of the events causing rates to drop precipitously. We chose this approach and have now moderated back
to our more neutral interest rate risk profile. We materially benefited from our asset sensitive balance sheet
position in 2022, as well as our focus on top line revenue growth. We recorded the strongest annual loan growth
in our history, with loan growth across the geographic footprint and across business line sectors.
As a result of our diverse fee base, we came very close to covering the 53% year-over-year decline in mortgage
banking fees, establishing new records in our commodities and investment banking businesses. Last year
included loan loss reserve releases of $100 million compared to actual provision of $30 million in 2022. A broad
selection of products to our client base produced the top line revenue growth we set our focus on at the beginning
of the year and has us well positioned as we start the New Year.
Credit quality continues to be very stable and better than pre-pandemic levels, though it is likely unsustainable.
We continue to maintain a combined allowance above the median of our peers. We are in a stage where investing
in strong banks versus trading the sector are expected to matter. Banks with thoughtful growth, a diverse
business mix, meaningful core deposits and proven credit discipline should outperform. We are well positioned for
however the economy should shift, favorable or negatively, as we move through the incoming year.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe just looking at the asset sensitivity and the steps you took this quarter, are you where you want to be in
terms of now being more fully neutral? Or should we expect to see some additional moves to the securities
portfolio to get there? And then on the funding for that, was that match funded or what's the duration on funding
on that positioning?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, Jared, we're pretty happy with the neutral position that we got out of that increase. And we'll continue to
look at that position as the year progresses. I mean, that's something that we look at on a continuous basis, but
that's all funded with variable rate funding. It has to be to generate the impact of the rate risk position. So, that's
how that played out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. So on that trade, we can expect to see maybe spread expansion as rates start to move back down later on.
What's the duration on the securities purchases?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, those are our typical mortgage-backed securities. And so, that's kind of been that three-year, a little
longer than that duration territory.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then on the loan growth, it seems like there's, like you said, good momentum going into the
year. Are you seeing better spreads on loans now? And then, also, what would have to happen, I guess, for
customers to come back in and reengage and see that utilization rate move higher as we go forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Okay, Jared. This is Marc Maun. The spread really hasn't – I wouldn't say expanded, but it hasn't
contracted either. It's really just tracked [ph] along (24:04) all year long. I'd say it's fairly consistent. So, we haven't
really seen any significant change in that.
As far as utilization rates go, I mean, focusing on the C&I side, I could see our CRE will go up naturally just from
construction loans. But the C&I side, it's more just, I think a reflection of our customers have been expanding
commitments at a faster rate than they've been borrowing. And I think from their cash positions and liquidity
positions that they are going to expend some of that first before we start to see utilization rise. But we would
expect that to continue as you progress through time. It's still some of that that just has to be used up in the
business.

Okay. Thanks. And then just finally on capital. Where would you like – are you focusing primarily on the TCE ratio
here in terms of looking at how you want to control excess capital? Is that the right thing for us to be focusing on?
And where do you think, ultimately, that should flow out or stabilize?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Now, we range – and this is Steven. Now, we range somewhere in between 11.5% to 12% of tangible common
equity. And that's a range that we like, and that's what we look at primarily. Sometimes we are constrained by
total capital, but we've got a nice level of buybacks that you've seen over the last several quarters. We continue to
– we think we'll continue to do that opportunistically, use capital on that fashion, pay a good dividend. We raised
that just a little bit in the quarter. And then the rest, we'll allocate towards loan growth and balance sheet growth to
support our businesses. So, that's generally how we think about it.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, I just wanted to ask the buyback question. I'm a little different. I mean, if you look at 2022, you repurchased
around 2.5% of the company. It was about $155 million of stock. Should we expect something similar for 2023?
Or, I mean, you guys clearly have excess capital, so it feels like you could do more than that potentially.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
I would say probably similar. I think that kind of range that you've seen quarterly which has been anywhere from
$30 million to $50 million fits kind of that capital profile. We feel like we've got that level of dollars to buy back
stock, and it depends on the quarter. Scott executes that for us, and we opportunistically find a good price and
we'll be a little more active. If the price runs up, we'll slow down a bit. That's why you see that variable across
those various quarters. But I would anticipate a similar level of buybacks in 2023 and 2022. But again, it's all
contingent on what the market looks like.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. All right. And then BOKF has, for a long time, been a very experienced energy and healthcare lender. And
it's a meaningful amount of your loan book. I know energy is doing great just given the pricing backdrop, but yeah,
you start to hear of some weakness within healthcare. We're not seeing it in you all's numbers at all, but maybe
just an update on how you're thinking about your credit quality for the next couple of years out of your healthcare
borrowers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brady, this is Marc. We certainly are keeping our eye on the healthcare portfolio significantly because
probably the headwinds there are around the labor costs associated with the senior housing industry, which is the
primary area we focus on and the catch up that has to happen with our Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement
rates and which hasn't completely got there.
So, we're seeing – there's a – we're seeing a little bit of issues with that, but it's something we want to keep our
eye on. But over time, we have been – we've been in this business a long time. We've been very selective about
who we're focused on. Demographics favor the industry. We have focused on regional operators, not major
chains and large operators, people that have an understanding of the industry. And so, we've been through cycles
before, and we think we are comfortable with our customer selection. But certainly, that's the one we're going to
keep probably our strongest attention to in 2023.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
And I might just add. If you think about that sector from my perspective over the last 20 years, it's probably our
lowest net charge-off segment in our entire loan portfolio. We do have criticized, classified risk where because of
the timing of cash flows between when operating expenses are incurred versus when they may be reimbursed
from private or public payers, there can be some mismatches that creates some short-term, [ph] criticized (29:25)
classified levels. But if you think about it over a longer period of time, the loss rates in this portfolio are
exceptionally low. It's actually probably our best performing asset quality segment in our entire portfolio over the
last 20 years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's helpful. And then finally for me, BOKF has done a great job of growing fiduciary and asset
management fees. I mean, if I look at it over multiple years, it's just been a great source of revenue growth for you
guys. How should – I mean, not necessarily next quarter or even next year, but as we look out for the next couple
of years, should we continue to expect BOKF to see this nice revenue growth in that segment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure. So, this is Scott. We feel good about really the fact that not just our asset mix, which is very well diversified
between fixed income equity alternatives, but a healthy mid-teen percentage of cash, which now is obviously
serving us well in terms of fee generation of money market funds, both our proprietary and others that we utilize.
So, that's been nice to get that momentum and revenue generation back. But we're really seeing significant
progress in growing assets across all the various business lines inside of wealth management as well as in the
various customer segments that we serve.

So, we continue to be optimistic and feel good about how we're positioned to continue to see that segment grow,
given our account, new account attraction of assets with probably less market exposure and decline than many
others do that have a more skewed asset mix than us. So, we're very optimistic about it, yes.
[indiscernible] (31:30) differentiate is there a little bit is if you think about both the pandemic and the decline and
asset value during that period of time. And then last year were both fixed income and equity markets declined
really for the first time since 1969. The way we deliver into that segment through a very personalized approach,
people value that. So, if some in the market are moving more towards automated approaches or things like that,
the ability to have a touch point, to talk to an advisor, to talk about strategy and to reassure folks in difficult market
circumstances, the value of that is much higher today than perhaps in previous periods because of the volatility
that's been experienced. And we think that's a differentiator for us in the long term to help us grow this asset
base.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And, Marty, it's been a while, but looking forward to it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Right. Yeah. Looking forward to it as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Back to the Midwest, I guess. But can you guys help us a little bit on the cadence of the margin? You kind
of allude to it a little bit in your guidance. And I know you're focused more on NII. But you're saying modestly
lower until maybe some of the deposit rate and flow pressures ease. But does it fit – what kind of erosion are you
talking about early in the year? And do you think it can maybe stabilize and float higher later in the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, Jon, this is Marty. I'll take that. So, our rate risk position is now pretty neutral to a rate increase, and we
do think we'll get a rate increase or two early in the year. And that might be modestly beneficial, just at least
initially. The securities portfolio will continue to reprice higher. So, those are kind of the positives there.
Deposit mix shift is, of course, going to be the counterbalance as that kind of plays out and loan growth. That'll be
supportive for net interest revenue but just ever so slightly dilutive to margin. So, it's not at all clear exactly how
that shakes out timing wise, but that should result in some modest decline in margin. And nothing that's really
significant one way or the other.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, okay. Got it. That's helpful. So, not material changes.
Maybe Marc or Stacy. Like, I wrote down a couple of quotes. Marc, you said, should an economic slowdown
materialize. And, Stacy, you said, credit is unsustainably good. So, help us understand where your heads are at in
terms of what you've seen on credit. And it doesn't feel like you're signifying any kind of material slowdown in loan
growth, or am I wrong on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
This is Stacy. I think it's interesting to listen to the market funding's over the last six months, from there's a deep
recession coming to a soft recession to now a soft landing. Yeah, I don't think any of us know with any level of
precision what the future holds. We've got a deeply inverted yield curve, but we're also coming off a pandemic
that's unprecedented. And so, all of the economic metrics that people are accustomed to trying to use to predict
those types of economic outcomes are probably not as reliable.
Our viewpoint is if you think that we're going to have a soft landing and we're going to grow, we've demonstrated
our ability to grow. We grew loans organically, 13% this year, $2.6 billion. We're in a great footprint, and we're well
positioned for growth. If the economy does achieve a soft landing, our footprint is much better than most.

But if your view is that there will be a recession, then there will be more likely credit deterioration. Then we're one
of the best performing credit banks in the regional banks space, the largest bank in United States that didn't
participate in TARP. Our credit performance through the last meaningful downturn materially outperformed our
peers.
Credit is hard to forecast. We typically will say, the next six months are pretty easy to see. After about six months,
the [ph] lends (36:04) gets really foggy. But as we look forward from here, our classified loans are down, our
potential problem loans are down and our accrual loans are down. We're starting from an incredibly low point.
And so, even some migration up wouldn't necessarily even indicate a deterioration really in long-term credit
trends, really just a movement from abnormally low levels. And so, I don't know that any of us want to forecast
exactly what we think is going to happen because nobody really knows. But if it's a growth scenario, we're going
to perform well. If it's a credit event that people are worried about, then I think our credit history and our discipline
around that will serve us very well, if that is the scenario that has people concerned.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So, the view from [ph] Tulsa (36:57) is not Armageddon. It's just...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Not [ph] we (37:00). I mean, I think our view, even when people were forecasting a recession, was that it's entirely
likely that our footprint – think about Dallas, Houston, Denver, Phoenix, what's happening in those markets, that
there may be a level of material outperformance in our core markets then there may be in the rest of the country if
there is a recession. Because the level of in-migration into these markets is significant. And the economic growth
that's happening is far outpacing the national economy. So, even when the general consensus was there's going
to be a recession, we thought that we would be in a much better position just because of that footprint. But we're
not seeing anything today in discussions with our borrowers and our own data that would indicate that we think
there's a recession that's imminent.

Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. On the brokerage and trading line, I think the slide deck attributed higher levels of trading
from elevated margins. Any more color on the drivers of that higher margin? How sustainable is that into 2023?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, this is Scott. So, we saw – in all of the fixed income markets with the market volatility that Stacy alluded to,
we saw unprecedented volatility in the fourth quarter, but we continue to see with the level of rate uncertainty
that's out there in the marketplace, good spread capability. We're nimble and have a reasonably well diversified
product mix inside of the fixed income arena. So, we think that until there's an abatement of the uncertainty in the
market, volatility will continue to enjoy better margins there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Appreciate that. And then going back to deposits and funding, pretty big material outflow of demand
deposits in fourth quarter, and we're seeing this across the industry. And it sounds like the guidance you put out
there assumes continued pressure here. I'm curious what your expectations are, and within the guidance, when
do you expect that to stabilize?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. This is Marty. Let me give you a little color there. So yeah, our guidance does – our loan-to-deposit ratio
comes up some over 2023, and it presumes that our cumulative beta on deposits continues to increase somewhat
over 2023 to accommodate the retention of our interest-bearing deposits.
The DDA attrition, we see that more in the first part of the year. Any of these attrition factors, they either burn out
or conditions change and it's no longer relevant. That's kind of how we think about the outlook there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Matt, this is Stacy. I think that – we've seen commentary in the markets around the deposit attrition in the industry
broadly. I think a couple of things that are unique about us that I think need to be brought out, number one, is
we're starting from a much lower loan-to-deposit ratio than most of our peers in the space. And we, in the fourth
quarter, low 60% of loan-to-deposit ratio, Steven and I were talking, we run this bank at upper 70s, low-80s for a
long time. That's typically much more normal.
And so, that starting point gave us the ability to manage this liquidity and margin, and we're actively doing that.
We also have a lot of stored liquidity that's effectively off balance sheet through our broker dealer and our wealth
group, where funds that have left our balance sheet have gone to other sources that are controlled through our
broker dealer or wealth group. That's in the event that we need liquidity in a future period can be brought back at
the right price. So, it's not something that we see is necessarily problematic. It's something that we're actually
actively managing and watching to optimize for our shareholders.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yes. Okay. Appreciate that, Stacy. And I guess just kind of staying on this topic here. In the fourth quarter, I
mean, the funding plan was obviously some borrowings to kind of plug the hole. And, Stacy, you mentioned some
of the store liquidity that you could use this some time. But it didn't sound like that's a near-term event. So, what is
the plan, I guess, for funding at least for the first half of the year?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we would see both a stabilization in the overall deposit trends and some usage of wholesale really
throughout the year. On the wholesale side, as you know, the vast majority of our securities portfolio is US
government agencies which are ideal for pledging to FHLB. And it's really normal for us to have FHLB funding as
a core part of our overall funding base. I mean, that goes back 25, 30 years. So, it's really the recent couple of
years that are the anomaly. And eventually, we're all going to get to normal balance sheet profile at some point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Remember, Matt, I mean, pre-pandemic, we always viewed deposits funded the loan book and the securities
book was self-funding through other mechanism, whether it'd be FHLB or repo or other activities. And that's the
way we ran the bank for 25 years. And so, we're just kind of coming back to that. Deposits didn't bond loans and
securities historically. It's only been in the last really couple of three years where that's happened. We're still $6
billion higher in deposits today than we were December of 2019. So, we've got to put some of this in perspective
based upon the long-term perspective, not just based on a pandemic viewpoint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q

Yes. Yes. Fully agree. Okay. Thanks, guys.
