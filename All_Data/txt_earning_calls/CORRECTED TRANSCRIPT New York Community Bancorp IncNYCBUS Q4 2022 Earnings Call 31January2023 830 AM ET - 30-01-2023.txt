Q4 2022 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2023
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Salvatore J. DiMartino
Executive Vice President, Chief of Staff to the CEO & Director-Investor Relations, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. This is Sal DiMartino and thank you for joining the management team of New York
Community for today's conference call. We apologize for the long wait time for the call, but we were having
technical issues with our vendor. Today's discussion of the company's 2022 results will be led by President and
CEO, Thomas Cangemi, along with the company's Chief Financial Officer, John Pinto; and Lee Smith, President
of Mortgage.

Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Cangemi.

Thomas Robert Cangemi
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Sal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we're going to focus
on four topics; the Flagstar, the decision to restructure the mortgage business and our operating performance,
along with our outlook for the new Flagstar.
2022 was a watershed year for New York Community, culminating in our acquisition of Flagstar, our largest
acquisition to-date, which closed on December 1st. As you have heard me say many times on these calls and in
one-on-one meetings, this is a transformational acquisition for us and we are already seeing some of the benefits
we've outlined when the transaction was first announced.
The transaction to a dynamic, commercial banking model is underway, with a more diversified balance sheet,
which was evident at year-end as commercial loans represented 33% of total loans compared to 24% before the
merger announcement. Legacy Flagstar brings a number of new lending-related businesses to the new company,
most of which are C&I businesses. All of these are higher margin businesses, and they are typically tied to
floating interest rates.
These new businesses include a nationally-recognized mortgage warehouse business where we currently rank
number two in the country based on $11.5 billion of commitments outstanding. Builder finance is another great
business, where we do business with 70% of the top 100 builders nationwide. The spreads in this marketplace is
approaching 400 basis points in that particular business. In addition, Flagstar adds a significant wholesale
banking operation focusing on several verticals. These loans are conservatively underwritten and also generate
significant fee income that legacy NYCB did not have.
Going forward, we plan to allocate more capital to these higher margin businesses. The same is also true on the
funding side. Legacy Flagstar contributes a significantly lower cost deposit base, including traditional retail
deposits and a large amount of commercial balances related to mortgage businesses, including escrow balances.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2023
Additionally, both companies have a very strong market share position within each of their respective core
markets, which will aid in acquiring more deposits as we grow.
The benefits of Flagstar deposit base are already evident in the fourth quarter results, as noninterest-bearing
deposits increased to 21% of total deposits compared to 9% prior to the merger announcement. Another
important benefit is to our interest rate sensitivity. Our sensitivity to interest rate changes has improved materially
due to the acquisition. As you will recall, legacy New Your Community has historically been liability sensitive,
while legacy Flagstar was significantly asset sensitive.
On a combined basis, the new company will have a more balanced interest rate sensitivity position, and we will
have more flexibility in managing our sensitivity to market rate changes. Given the nature of our new asset
classes, paired with low corresponding mix, the new company will be able to enjoy a stronger margin going
forward.
As for our mortgage business, we disclosed early today actions aimed to optimize our mortgage platform. The
substantial and aggressive shift in Fed monetary policy over the past year resulted in significantly higher
mortgage rates. This rapid increase has stifled refinancing activity, and also dampened purchase activity. While
legacy Flagstar was proactive throughout 2022 in rightsizing its mortgage business, the mortgage market is
expected to remain challenged in 2023, with annual originations volume expected to decline by 25% year-over-
year to $1.8 trillion after dropping 46% last year compared to 2021.
Therefore, shortly after the transaction closed, we made the strategic decision to swiftly restructure the business,
which occurred late last week. To better reflect demand and align to where our strengths lie, our distributed retail
channel will shift to a branch footprint-only model, resulting in a 69% reduction in the number of retail home
lending offices. Mortgage origination head count is expected to decline to less than 800 FTEs compared to a high
of 2,100 FTEs in 2021. Headcount reduction represents approximately 10% of total employees at the combined
company's previous structuring.
These decisions are among the most difficult our senior leadership team has to make; however, they are
necessary to ensure the long-term success and viability of our mortgage business. These actions are expected to
improve profitability in the mortgage business during the current downcycle, while still allowing us to participate in
the upside, in the event the interest rate environment becomes more favorable.
Despite these actions, we remain one of the top players in the mortgage business. We are a leading bank
originator for the mortgages, the sixth largest subservicer, and the second largest warehouse lender. In addition,
we continue to lend in all six channels, and remain committed to the correspondent and broker business.
Turning now to our 2022 operating performance. Despite the significant shift in Fed policy last year, 2022 is still
another record year for the company. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported fully diluted EPS of $1.23 for full year
2022, relatively unchanged compared to the $1.24 we reported for 2021. Net income available to common
stockholders, as adjusted, totaled $603 million for full year 2022 compared to $585 million in 2021. Our net
income in 2021 was a record at that time; and in 2022, we broke that record.
While our financials were impacted by one month of combined results, legacy New York Community performed
extremely well, with strong organic growth in loans and deposits. Multi-family loans increased $3.5 billion, or 10%,
to $38.1 billion compared to 2021, with virtually all of the growth coming organically. Specialty finance loans rose
$912 million, or 26%, during the year to $4.4 billion. At the same time, organic deposit growth was $7.6 billion, up

22%. This improved about $3 billion in growth during the fourth quarter related to our government banking-as-a-
service business.
Our fourth quarter net interest margin improved 6 basis points to 2.28% compared to the prior quarter. Excluding
the impact from prepayment income, the fourth quarter margin was to 2.24%, up 9 basis points compared to the
previous quarter, which is better than our original guidance.
Our credit quality metrics remain solid and reflect the strong credit culture of both legacy organizations. NPAs to
total assets equaled 17 basis points, while NPLs to total loans were 20 basis points, continuing to rank as among
the best in the industry. These metrics are proof positive that our conservative underwriting standards have
served us well over various business cycles. This, along with a high quality balance sheets, should serve us well
in the event of a downturn in the economy.
As for real estate trends in our primary New York City market, the residential rental market remains healthy,
despite some moderation in the effective median rent due to the weaker performance in the luxury market, while
our bread-and-butter non-luxury rent regulation mix remains very strong. Manhattan monthly median rent in
November rose nearly 20% year-over-year to $4,033, up month-over-month following three straight months of
decline and was up 15.2% above the pre-pandemic levels.
On the office front, Manhattan's direct asking rents in the fourth quarter decreased 0.6% from the third quarter to
$74.29 per square foot, while the office availability rate was up 18.7%, or 30 basis points. Manhattan retail
average asking rents recorded a 2.2% uptick quarter-over-quarter to $607 per square foot, the first increase since
the fourth quarter of 2016 due to a resurgence in travel and tourism and consumer demand.
Also, as of year-end, our capital ratios remain very strong. Accordingly, last week, our board of directors declared
a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share in the company's common stock. The dividend's payable on
February 16th to common shareholders of record as of February 6th. Based on last night's closing price, this
reflect a dividend yield of approximately 7%.
Looking forward to 2023, this is what you can expect from the new company throughout the year and into 2024.
First, we're going to have one brand across the combined organization. The divisional bank concept has worked
well for legacy NYCB while we're mostly in the New York City Metro region, but now that we are one of the largest
regional banks in the country with 395 branches in 9 states, along with a national presence in several businesses,
we are confident that a unified brand will position us to thrive.
We will have one bank, one brand, one culture. Our new brand will be Flagstar. While the Flagstar name will
remain, the associated brand, look, feel, logo, purpose, and what the name stands for will change. We plan to
officially roll out the new logo and brand publicly in late 2023, but it will not be fully operational and used externally
until systems conversion, which is scheduled to occur during the first quarter of 2024.
As for guidance, given the current outlook, we expect average loan growth of 5%; first quarter NIM to expand from
fourth quarter levels to a range of 2.55% to 2.65%, including prepayments, which are expected to have less of an
impact on the NIM going forward; first quarter gain on sale mortgage loan of $18 million to $22 million; full year
noninterest expense range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, excluding merger-related expenses and intangible asset
amortization; and a full year tax rate of approximate 25.5%.
Finally, I would like to send a big shout out to all of our employees at both banks. None of what we have
accomplished so far would have been possible without their patience, support, and hard work. Their commitment

to our customers and borrowers over the past several years has truly been remarkable. My sincere thanks to
them all.
With that, we will be happy to answer any questions you may have. We will do our very best to get it all you within
the time remaining. But if we don't, please feel free to call us later today. Operator, please open the line for
questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our
first questions come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with your
questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Morning, Ebrahim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Good morning. So, congrats on closing the deal. I guess maybe the first question, if I heard
you correctly, Tom, I think you mentioned systems conversions up until first quarter of 2024, sounds a bit longer
than usual. Just wondering if there are any reasons why it's going to take that long to move – do the systems
conversion? And, secondly, just remind us [indiscernible] (00:11:57) cost savings from the franchise and where
you think the expense base reset once you have all the expense savings tied to the deal, maybe as we think
about post-conversion what it looks like.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
All right. Let's start with the latter question first. And by the way, we apologize for the long delay this morning. That
was unfortunate, but we do apologize for that. Let's just talk about the overall expense run rate going forward. We
gave out a guidance level of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion for 2023. Bear in mind, we continue to put the companies
together through synergies. When we first announced the transaction, we estimated about $125 million of merger-
related cost benefits, exclusive of the mortgage business specifically. So, we kind of called that out when we
looked at the combined operation.
So, we're assuming that. Obviously, we're restructuring mortgage going to 2023. That is taking place as we
speak. So, in addition to that, we also have the ongoing continuation of synergies throughout 2023, and also a
substantial benefit most likely in the first quarter 2024 going back to the actual system conversion, which we have
planned.
This is a full blown conversion of all systems. So, this is going to be a substantial undertaking for the bank. We
feel very confident that's the right appropriate timeframe, but it's going to be our largest conversion. And a lot of
our core upgrade systems that we're getting on a combined basis will be part of that conversion. So we're taking
this process obviously very seriously. We want to make sure that we have the appropriate time to integrate. So,
clearly, first quarter of 2024 is where we're targeting.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2023
I would not expect that to become any early than that. So, first quarter 2024 is the date. But a lot of work has been
done as far as choices on systems, a substantial amount of decision-making has gone into what's best for the
customer, and we're changing a lot on the NYCB side to upgrade ourselves to be more in the regional bank space
and to other technology systems that we don't currently have. This goes all into that upgrade. So, we're super
excited about the opportunity, but it's going to take a little bit of time; and at the same time, I mentioned in my
prepared remarks, we're also going to be rebranding into the first quarter as well.
So, going back to the cost structure, I feel highly confident that that range is very reasonable. But we feel that
historically the company has been in integrated institutions. We have a great road map here. We spent a lot of
time getting to know each other. At the same time, we're building an institution that's going to be very diverse.
And in our run rate has some buildout of additional, we'll call, cost centers that are going to drive revenue
opportunities on a combined basis. And I think that range is a reasonable range given that we are restructuring
mortgage on a combined basis. So, I think the range that we gave you, $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, hopefully we'll
come in towards the front end of the range, but we feel pretty confident about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess then given all the investments you're making and I think it all makes sense, is it fair to assume like that's a
steady state – you might get some savings for the systems conversion next year, but then you're also investing in
the franchise?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
That's a...

John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
...fair statement, Ebrahim. We didn't give out 2024 guidance...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Sure. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
...but [indiscernible] (00:15:07) a lot of the system conversion will result in significant overlap on technology, as
well as the benefits for cost savings. Maybe, John, if you want to add some more color to that.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2023
Yeah. I think that's right. You'll see some of those – that $125 million in savings come through over the next
couple of months as part of the process we're going through. And then there'll be more, as Tom just mentioned,
that'll come once the systems conversion's done into in Q1 of 2024. So I think, Ebrahim, you're right, that makes a
lot of sense as to where we can kind of see a steady state going forward at least in 2023 and 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Ebrahim, just to go back to the concept of the conversion. This is really a transformational transaction for the
bank. We said it all along. We're moving towards a commercial banking model. And with that commercial banking
model, there are a lot of technology tools that we are going to implement as part of the combined NewCo. That's
what's pushing out the conversion maybe a quarter or two and that's why we feel very confident that the date
makes sense for us. This is not that historical NYCB thrift model. We are going to a commercial banking model
with unique technology tools that are consistent with regional banks of our size.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. That's helpful. And just on a separate question, you gave the first quarter NIM guide. How do we
think about the net interest margin and the two scenarios? In a world where rates just stay higher for longer, how
do you think the NIM plays out? And then [indiscernible] (00:16:27) if rates get cut, do you still expect the balance
sheet to be liability sensitive and benefit from the NIM benefiting from rate cuts? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'll start the conversation. I'm going to defer to John. But, big picture, we're assuming that we're going to have
probably two more hikes coming in the short-term and probably a pause and probably looking at the forward
curve, an adjustment towards November is for the first cut. That's really much playing through the forward curve.
But the reality is that where we stand today on positioning, we're probably maybe 4% or 5%-ish liability sensitive
going into this most likely pause situation in Q1.
We have the capacity to move plus or minus 5% very easily. So, right now, just by putting the balance sheet
together, without any restructuring, without any sales of assets, sitting here just probably slightly liability sensitive,
and we have the ability to pivot very quickly.
So, maybe, John, if you want to add some more color towards the sensitivity on the market rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I'd just highlight what Tom said. Now that we're not as significantly liability sensitive as NYCB has been
historically, it just gives us the opportunity to be able to manage towards a neutral asset base depending on
market conditions; so slightly liability sensitive now. We are forecasting the two rate hikes in February and March,
which is really what's impacting the margin in 2023. The cut at the end of the year really doesn't have much of an
impact in the 2023 guide.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And Tom, you mentioned restructuring of the balance sheet. Like, should we be expecting any meaningful
restructuring once there's clarity on the path of Fed interest rates?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2023
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think the reality is that we put the company together at year-end. We had an opportunity to look at some of the
assets that, in particular mortgage rate, that we can structure into an opportunity for liquidity, and liquidity is
expensive right now. So, if we go into cash or short-term securities, we're not going at zero anymore. It's around –
approaching close to 5%, assuming two more rate increases. So, we have flexibility here.
We believe that, eventually, when the securitization markets open, we have lots of liquidity we can flow through
given the assets that were acquired through the Flagstar transaction, some of those resi portfolios and other asset
classes. But the reality is it goes back to the opportunity to really deploy capital into higher margin businesses.
We're being very cautious in respect to pricing. We have a very interesting opportunity in front of us regarding
yields.
And if you think about our multi-family business, they're averaging in the 3s and the market's closer to 6% right
now. We're not seeing a lot of refinance activity. We're not seeing a lot of purchase activity. What we are seeing is
that we still have about $8 billion over the next two years repricing, mandatory repricing. They have to make a
decision, and that market is a much higher rate environment. Assuming the Fed holds this for longer, I think our
customers will have to just go into a different option, which will be a higher interest rate to do nothing.
So, we'll manage through that very carefully. We're seeing about half of those loans go right into our new product,
which is a SOFR product, which is a floating rate product, which is great for interest rate risk. We're endorsing that
as a company. But we feel very confident that we can move the portfolio to a higher yielding asset class, at the
same time, be very focused on the best yielding opportunities in the marketplace because we have diversification.
This bank now has a very well diverse vertical opportunity, and we're going to make sure that we maximize our
capital spend to ensure better margins going forward. Starting the year off with a much stronger margin with the
opportunity to redeploy capital into higher margin businesses is an attractive position to be in.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, look, we have a lot of moving parts here that's new to the company, in particular the capital markets activity. I
think that, that's going to be – again, it's not modeled in, it's not anticipated as part of the synergies of the merger,
benefits of the merger; but we think that now that we have a capital markets division that's going to look at options
for our customer base to put on derivatives synthetic positions to hedge their loan products, I think that's going to
be a great benefit to the bank.
In addition to that, we can also be creative for our multi-family customers as well to offer those similar products.
And we're not going to put on long duration paper without any synthetic position which drives into fee income. At
the same time, I'm going to defer to Lee Smith because he's obviously running the mortgage business, and that's
always going to be a very interesting opportunity if the mortgage business does start to pick up. But reality is that
we're starting at probably the low point, so we're hoping it doesn't get much worse than this, but we're starting at
the low.
So, maybe Lee Smith could add some color on fee income between servicing and mortgage production. Lee?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Senior Executive Vice President & President-Mortgage, Flagstar Bank, FSB
Yeah. Thanks, Tom. And we provided this in the guidance. So, we're guiding for Q1 gain on loans sale to be
between $18 million and $22 million. And then, the net return on the MSR asset, we're guiding 8% to 10%. I think
we'll be at the top end of that range. So, if you combine those two numbers, we're sort of in the $45 million, $50
million range from a fee income point of view on the mortgage origination side.
And then, we've obviously got loan admin income on the servicing side, given our significant subservicing
business. Now, from a GAAP accounting point of view, there is an offset as it relates to the interest we pay on
escrows, which should really be up in the net interest income line. And so, we're going to get a benefit from that
even though you don't quite see from a GAAP point of view; when we break out the servicing P&L, you do see
that fee income given the significant subservicing business we have.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, with that being said, just to add on to Lee's commentary, assuming there is a Fed pause and it moves
the other way, say, towards the end of this year, that will also generate higher fee income, because now the cost
of that liability becomes much lower as we manage that servicing portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then, Tommy, could you share with us sort of the timing and costs associated with rebranding?

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:22:46). We feel very comfortable that we've done a ton of work over the past two years now on
really setting the NewCo, which is going to be the new Flagstar. A lot of spend has been already taking place. As
far as the branding efforts for the future, more towards 2024 than 2023, I'd say where the dollar outlay will come
in. But where we stand right now, money has been spent on setting up the brand itself, our vision, our mission,
obviously our position in the marketplace. And obviously, there'll be new signage for all of the 395 locations. It's all

going to be, as we said, one cohesive brand, one culture, one name. And that will start towards the back end of

Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And last question I had for you was on the loan-to-deposit ratio. Is there a level at which you'd sort of cap that,
wouldn't exceed? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Mark, I would say big picture is that our passion, as you can see over the past few years, we've done a
significant shift in how we're funding the balance sheet, right. There's been a lot more deposit growth. We're
looking at alternative solutions to fund our business. That's going to be part of our DNA going forward.
We are focusing on funding this balance sheet very differently than it was historically. We want to get away from
our dependency on non-traditional funding. We believe that various mortgage-as-a-service businesses, our
government-as-a-service business are focused at really trying to take the embedded nature of mortgage and go
after the clientele as a $90 billion organization could put us in a very unique position to gather more deposits.
We were very successful a few years back when we started the mandatory initiative of if we're going to lend you
money, we need to have a deposit relationship. That's going to be the culture going forward. So, our passion here
is to be less funded wholesale, be funded more traditional in nature; and we're looking at all avenues to bring in a
mix of funding that life is better so we can have a much better cost of fund and better stability on our funding mix.
If you think about the magnitude of our wholesale book of liabilities, if you replace that with, we'll call, a true core
deposit, it's a game-changer for multiple. So, the goal here is to be less dependent on mortgage, less dependent
on wholesale, and focus on multiple expansion over time. And that's our passion. That's our business model.
Every day, it's within our DNA. It's not going to happen overnight. We said that when I took over as CEO, this is
culturally where we're going. And we're making that long-term vision of trying to change the dynamic of the
traditional thrift model towards a commercial banking model.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey, good morning, guys, and congrats on the deal.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Been a long time, David. But we're very pleased to be here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Glad to see it. Just on the portable advances you guys have, is it fair to say that the
margin result this quarter and the guide for next quarter includes the repricing of all the – like $1 billion or so of
those advances that you have at this point? So, you're not really expecting a cliff repricing of that in 2Q or
beyond?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. If you look at it, I mean, we do have a lot of borrowings coming due in 2023. So, when you look at that
amount, we have probably just under $7 billion coming due in the first quarter of 2023 and that's...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
In the guide, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, that's in the guide. That's in the guidance. The cost of that is in the $330 million range, $340 million range.
So, there'll be a bit of a lift there but nothing significant. There are portables on the books, as you mentioned, but
they're spread out on what their lockout dates are. So, we don't expect to have the cliff issue that we had in the
third and the fourth quarter of 2022.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Dave, I will just say, just to John's point, we want to have some flexibility to go into 2023 depending on our
balance sheet maneuverability, depending where rates start to normalize here. And we have an opportunity to
really look at the assets that we've acquired and see what assets we're going to hold. There has been no
restructuring as of year-end. We priced – we looked at the marketplace. We believe when the marketplace
becomes more opportunistic for us to think about maybe reshifting our proceeds into maybe a debt reduction or a
debt restructuring, that's always on the table.
We'll look at what makes sense in the marketplace. But clearly, having the optionality is going to be important
especially with most likely a pause coming, and perhaps if the back end of the curve continues to be steep like

this, we may have some opportunities to take on some cheaper funding, at the same time, keep some money
relatively short to pay down some debt. Because obviously the short-term money is very expensive right now. So,
we have that optionality on the table.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Well, to your point on reducing the debt, just on the deposit side, you guys have obviously been working on
a number of deposit initiatives that you talked about earlier and in prior calls. I was just wondering if can size the
new opportunity that you now have post the deal close. I know you talked about the warehouse customer deposits
that you could go after previously once you closed the deal. If you just kind of size that, how big that opportunity is
at this point, and then hit on any other areas that you could point to.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I always said when we announced the transaction, I envisioned the embedded nature of just mortgage alone as a
$10 billion opportunity. I felt highly confident that with Lee Smith's business regarding the escrow business, the
loans that we service for others, as well as the warehouse business, it's a tremendous opportunity in respect to
the type of credit facility that we offer some of our clients given our size now. Our balance sheet at $90 billion,
managing this business and being number two in warehouse in the country gives us a good shot at really bringing
in real funding opportunities for the bank.
That being said, we still have a very interesting opportunity to take the technology that NYCB currently has that's
going to improve with Flagstar to make further improvements to start banking the mortgage business. I think the
mortgage business, given the magnitude of our positioning, could have a lot more deposits attached to it. Maybe,
Lee, if you want to add some color to the opportunity here on the mortgage side, but this is really what we saw
from day one that we could easily build that up.
And in addition to it, the other lines of areas that we're building up, which includes government-as-a-service, doing
some technology deposit opportunities, as well as going after the legacy NYCB customers to ensure that we
make loans with deposit. Maybe, Lee, if you want to add some color on the deposit gathering opportunity on the
mortgage side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Senior Executive Vice President & President-Mortgage, Flagstar Bank, FSB
Yeah. I think to Tom's point and he's mentioned mortgage-as-a-service for 18 months now. I mean, we have
today about $4.2 billion of escrow deposits from our service and subservicing book, and NYCB has at least a
couple of billion of escrow deposits. And so we can bring more of those deposits in from the people that we're
subservicing for, not just the deposits attached to the loans that we're servicing or subservicing, but other escrow
deposits that they have with other institutions.
I mean, to Tom's point, given the technology the New York Community Bank has that we haven't had at Flagstar,
there's an opportunity to go and raise core deposits from our TPO base. And remember, we're dealing with about
3,000 TPO correspondents, brokers, by having this sort of technology that allows them to do their business
banking with New York Community Bank. And I think that's a big opportunity. And we can also take that
technology to our warehouse customers as well, which we haven't done previously. So, I think we can go and
bring more escrow deposits in as well as core deposits as a result of the enhanced technology.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2023
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And like I indicated, we are a major credit provider for some of these clients. And when you get to the point
where we are their primary credit facility, we should have a shot out of all of the deposit opportunities that they
typically utilize in the marketplace. Not a guarantee; but, clearly, the more money you have on the table, the more
opportunity you have to really drive the relationship opportunity.
In addition to that, thinking about the C&I opportunity, we have a long history here of not being in the market with
boots on the ground on a stand-alone basis legacy NYCB. Flagstar has made that transition. The goal here on a
combined basis is to have boots on the ground focused on C&I, mid-market-sized companies. And given that
we've been in this business since the mid-1800s, we have a shot of really catapulting our deposit growth initiative
when it comes to boots on the ground on C&I side.
So, while our C&I activity that's being done and Flagstar is being integrated into NYCB, we have, like I indicated
on our opening commentary, a lot of verticals here that's going to be deposit driven. As we start focusing on the
lending facilities, we're going to focus on deposit growth. And deposit growth is going to be core value to our DNA
to improve the balance sheet metrics of this company.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Sounds good. Maybe one last quick one, just back on your comment that you're upgrading systems. What are
some of the bigger systems that you're going to be upgrading over the [indiscernible] (00:31:56).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I would just [indiscernible] (00:31:59) we're growing into a complex platform with Fiserv. We have a DNA
platform. They have Architect. We'll have a hybrid version of something very unique, best opportunity as our core.
But what's interesting to that, we also have a relationship with – they have a relationship with Salesforce on a
business development opportunity [indiscernible] (00:32:17) very powerful for the company.
I think that's very unique that we haven't had here at NYCB that we can utilize throughout the entire organization.
For example, even the front-end system on loan process. Their front-end is very advanced, more in line with the
regional bank model. They use nCino. We don't have nCino. So, there's opportunities here that are significantly
ramping up ourselves to a regional player when it comes to technology utilization.
At the same time, we're also giving Flagstar on the commercial services side an opportunity to really upstart the
treasury function, the treasury capability of our correlations that we have in Fiserv on commercial services, which
is it's been very successful for us. We've been really growing our core deposit base for our customers with the
commercial services technology platform, where five years ago it was not an offering. And that has changed our
ability to solidify the relationship lending on the deposit side. So, that's going to be I think a big win for the folks
over at Flagstar to utilize that technology.
So, collectively, there's a lot of moving parts here, but like I said, moving away from a traditional thrift model to
more of a commercial regional model when it comes to the tech stack. And there's probably 10 other items that I
can't disclose. I could throw a couple of names out there but there's a lot of moving parts here, Dave, that's going
to really enhance the experience of the customer we got in the new Flagstar.

Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brody Preston with UBS. Please proceed with
your questions.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Group AG
Hi. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Group AG
Hey, Tom. I just wanted to follow up on the expense commentary. I'm sorry if I missed it, but could you tell us
what the cost savings are from the mortgage restructure and the timing of when those kind of work in to 2023?
And then, separately, kind of what's a good run rate for operating expenses for the first quarter of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, obviously, the first quarter is going to be the highest quarter because it's always the highest quarter of the
year with payroll taxes and the like. But we embarked upon the mortgage repositioning restructuring of that line at
channel in late in January. So, we'll see that benefit going through towards the back end of Q1.
The number is significant. As I indicated on our opening commentary, we're taking it down to around 800 FTEs,
where before at the high in 2021, that was 2,100. So it's a significant downsizing when it comes to a line of
business. That being said, there is a benefit there on cost reduction. At the same time, we took into account the
revenue offset of that as well, right. So, you're taking out [indiscernible] (00:34:54) balance sheet opportunity. So
you have to look at the revenue side.
And we also went into, I'll call it, called shared services tie to embedded mortgages. So, all in, that number is well
over of $100 million stand-alone. But at the same time, we also have our own cost structure that we have to focus
on, on a combined basis on just the synergies of the companies combining. And that number is, as indicated back
when we announced the deal, it's about a $125 million.
Lee Smith has done a phenomenal job over the past year-and-a-half managing a very tough business. He's
always managed the business well, but 2022 was a challenging year. So, they've been cutting and cutting and
cutting. At the end of the day, we looked at the business at the fourth quarter and wanted to make sure that this
business is not losing any money. So, we think that, at this stage of the game where we focus on mortgage, we're

at a position where have optionality to make a lot of money in the market changes, but we're not going to be
losing money in the current environment. That's important as we set the stage with the run rate.
And think about the concept I was explaining on the call is that we want to be in a position where our multiple is
not tied solely to mortgage and our multiple is tied to a balanced revenue stream. Having this unique structure on
mortgage traditionally consistent with a lot of the regional banks of our size and having an embedded nature in
mortgage, we have a great opportunity to look at the multiple as more of a commercial bank-like multiple as we
transition to a true commercial bank from a thrift model on the funding side.
So, clearly, we want to focus on multiple expansion. We think this is one of the pieces to the puzzle to get there.
And we acted promptly right after the closing, given the conditions in the marketplace. So, when it comes to cost
structure, I gave guidance of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. We hope to be on the low end of that guide. But clearly,
we think it's a number that's achievable for us and the cost structure starts to see discernible adjustments starting
in February.
I apologize for the long answer, but there's a lot of moving parts here because you have to look at both mortgage
revenue and mortgage expense. Maybe, Lee, if you want to add some commentary...

Lee Matthew Smith A

...on the mortgage [indiscernible] (00:36:53) this journey and this is your hard work and effort, which we want to
commend for the effort as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Senior Executive Vice President & President-Mortgage, Flagstar Bank, FSB
Yeah. Thanks, Tom. I mean, it's a significant restructuring. There is going to be noise in the first quarter because
we're still running off the pipeline as it relates to the branches that we're closing down. We're paying severance
and then there's going to be some payments as we exit certain leases. We will isolate that as a restructuring
charge. But there is going to be noise in the first quarter as a result of that from a cost point of view. When I think
it'll be very clean will be April 1. But having said that, and as Tom alluded to, we're going to start seeing benefits
from what we've done as soon as February, given we executed on this restructuring last Thursday.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Group AG
Got it. Okay. And, Tom, maybe just one follow up on the expenses. Just given the conversion isn't happening until
the first quarter, I guess what percent of the $125 million should we think about being more 2024 oriented versus
2023?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Brody, I'd say half, but again, we've done a lot of transactions in our lifetime. We are going to – we have hit the
ground running hard. We know what we have to do as far as integration. This is typical when we look at
transactions and there's an opportunity here on a stand-alone basis. Like I indicated, we looked at the business

ex-mortgage when we announced the deal. We looked at a run rate was probably like $1.6 billion, almost $1.7
billion total cost structure. I mean, we tacked on about $125 million ex-mortgage.
But mortgage has changed. As I indicated, Lee has taken out a lot of cost in 2022. We think this is it. This is
where we feel very confident that we're lean. I think this is probably the lowest head count that Flagstar has had in
probably close to probably maybe eight or nine years now. So, I think we're in a very good position to really
capitalize. A lot of investment in technology has been made by Flagstar on the mortgage side that we can benefit
here. The servicing platform is substantial. It is a great opportunity to think about costs, selling some product on
the servicing side [indiscernible] (00:39:04) loan position, as well as deposit gathering efforts.
So, we're in a good spot. It's a difficult decision when you have to make these types of significant restructuring
efforts. But at this stage of the game, at that type of FTE, with this magnitude of the business and our presence,
we have an opportunity here to really drive revenue at the appropriate time if there's a resurgence in opportunity
in the mortgage business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Group AG
Got it. And then, maybe just switching over to the...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Just one other point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Group AG
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
The goal here was not to bleed. We don't want to hemorrhage red as we come together, and Lee was challenged
last year. Every quarter was a challenge when it comes to the changing interest rate environment. [indiscernible]
(00:39:40) going through quarterly repositioning on FTEs to the point where we looked at the business versus
balance sheet versus not balance sheet utilization. And we really want to go back to the traditional mortgage
banking model where you used balance sheet very selectively and we are getting our gain on sale opportunity,
and we build a servicing portfolio as a revenue stream. So we have a barbell strategy over time depending on
market interest rates.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Group AG
Got it. And then maybe if I could just switch to the deposit base real quick; you've mentioned the forward curve a
couple times in the call today, Tom. So, just, I wanted to ask, near-term kind of where do you see your cost of
interest-bearing deposits or your deposit beta going as the Fed kind of continues the hike early in the year and
then pauses. And then, secondarily, just given the back end of the forward curve is starting to head down, how
are you thinking about structuring your deposits from a maturity perspective from a [indiscernible] (00:40:34)?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2023
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'm going to defer – I'll defer that question to John Pinto, our CFO. John?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, if we look at deposit betas, the balance sheet's really broken out into two different types, right? If you're
looking at our deposit's tied to either mortgage-as-a-service, banking-as-a-service, some of the brokered
business, that's high beta. It's remained high beta since the beginning of the rate hike cycle. And then, if you look
at the more retail, the more stable piece from both legacy NYCB and legacy Flagstar, they have been much,
much lower betas, of course, than that.
They've started to tick up, I think, like just about everyone have seen – other banks have seen over the last
couple of quarters. So, we'll monitor that as well. But when you look at where the curve is, you'd get to I think
what Tom is talking about a little bit earlier. We do have a lot of flexibility in the borrowing base as well. So, we'll
be able to look at both where our deposits are funded and how they're funded, as well as borrowings to ensure
we're ready for either of those positionings, right; either liability sensitive, slightly liability sensitive, or if we needed
to move, we could move that to asset sensitivity without too much difficulty with some shrinkage on the asset side.
So, I think we have the opportunity to do both there. And I think our deposit base, like I mentioned, is kind of split
between what's in normal retail and what we have in the banking-as-a-service business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Brody, this is Tom. Just to follow up on that. I made a very clear commentary probably about a year-and-a-
half ago that if we go from zero to a much higher rate environment, now we'll just reiterate the point, zero to, let's
say, 5%, I don't think you're hiding from people getting paid on excess liquidity. So, that's the marketplace. So this
is a phenomena in the financial services business right now that money is very expensive right now. People want
to get paid. The reality is, is that this company we have now is not going to be 20%, 30% liability sensitive. We're
going to be closer to neutral.
I think that's the game-changer for us as we look at this combined business of Flagstar/NYCB that we're going to
position ourselves to not be vulnerable to rates going up. We want to take advantage of rates up and down as a
business model. And that's the uniqueness of the verticals, the type of assets we're going to have with our floating
rate and having a better funding mix. So, I think that's really the benefit of the merger that we're super excited
about today.
And I think, like I said, when we put the banks together and we're around 4%, 5% liability sensitive without any
repositioning or any assets. And we think that we have a lot of liquidity if we want to tap liquidity at the appropriate
time, assuming market conditions warrant that. So, I think having optionality is good here. And I think that the new
Flagstar is a much bigger balance sheet with a lot of great clients so we can service, I call them the five star
clients that we're going to go after and bank them and go after the funding opportunity. But our DNA is going to
focus on getting great deposits to fund this institution, very differently than a traditional thrift model.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. You noted the $3 billion contribution from banking-as-a-service product for government
entities. Can you talk a little bit more about the growth opportunity there especially given that those are lower cost
deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, we've done a really solid job on partnering with our fintech providers, and this has been a very good line of
business for the bank as an alternative solution for funding the balance sheet. This particular program in the
fourth quarter was driven off the California inflation stimulus benefit that was out there. We were the bank partner,
the BIN provider, along with a very large tech company that partnered into the Money Network card business.
That will dissipate but that was another program that we rolled up. Bear in mind, we've also made mention that we
are the US Treasury BIN provider for Money Network cards going forward and anything that the Treasury does on
the cards side. So, we have the opportunity to continue to build the business, as well as other municipalities at the
state level for a lot of the unemployment funds that we process under the Money Network card business.
So that business is going really well. We have a bunch of onboarding happening in 2023. I will tell you that it's
hard to predict what quarter they come in. So, we don't really count them because they come in and they're fairly
large. And what's interesting about this model is that not only did we ramp up the opportunity to work with our
technology providers, but we were also able to get our bankers into the municipal side of things and start the
actual core deposit banking.
So, some of these relations resulted in a pure deposit relationship, either payroll for a state, doing some operating
activity for the state, and it's been meaningful in respect to the deposit opportunity. This is something that we
[indiscernible] (00:45:20) top institutions in the country along with the top technology companies. And it's an RFP
process. And we've been very successful over the past year-and-a-half, but it does take time to onboard. So, I
don't want to give any, we'll call it, aggressive vision of how much can come on; but when they do come on, it
becomes meaningful.
So, for example, California was about a $3 billion average balance and the cost of that was zero. We have some
other programs that are coming in this year depending on how quickly we ramp up US Treasury. That could be
depending on what program is actually endorsed by the government. And we would be then the company that's
ready to go with issued cards at their will when they're ready to make a decision on funding.
So, it's an interesting program. It's a good line of business. It's one of our three pillars of the banking-as-a-service
business that we carved out along with mortgage and tech, and it's been very successful. It started out back
during the pandemic, and we were a very large balance sheet provider for stimulus payments, and we were able

to hold some nice balances for a considerable period of time on the card side and we continue to leverage off of
that.

Got it. And can you just remind us of the seasonality within the banking-as-a-service portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
There's obviously the three components. The one that's very seasonal is obviously escrow payments when you
have mortgages coming in and out, you have tax payments. But we think that's going to be something that we
could really drive further deposit opportunity like I indicated in my previous commentary. On the Lee Smith's
business, it's tremendous opportunity to really be focused on managing the P&I payments and the tax payments
for our large customers that we do business with, both on the warehouse side as well as on the servicing side.
And that number, it goes up and down depending when the payments go back to the municipalities on the tax
side. But there's always the P&I payments coming through. And we have a long history under AmTrust mortgage
to manage that. So, I think we have a few billion dollars of pre-consolidation with Flagstar, as we indicated. I think
it was at $4 billion. So, it's probably around $6 billion now, but I see a $10 billion opportunity there just by the
current client base as we go after it.
It's very volatile in respect to interest rates. There's a cost to that, but as things start to normalize on the interest
rates side, we have an opportunity to have a different funding mechanisms versus nontraditional wholesale
funding that the bank has been accustomed to, so another source of opportunity.
And the ones that we have credit with, I really feel – the clients that we have credit with, I feel that we could do a
better job on banking that client. And that's what we're going to go after. As we indicated, the true operating
activity that we could be helpful given our size and balance sheet, and our technology offerings as well.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2023
Steven, how are you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good. How are you, Tom? I wanted to start on NIM. So, I appreciate the 1Q 2023 guidance. But, Tom, what does
it mean in the release? Here you say you expect 2023 margin above where you ended the year. I would think that
would be on a spot basis, maybe consistent with 1Q 2023 guidance. Can you talk through that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'll give a broad discussion of funds. John will go into the details. Well, what we kind of indicated that we have one
month of Flagstar at the fourth quarter going into our current NIM on a historical look-back basis for Q4, and we're
in the low 2.20%, or is it 2.28%, John?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
2.28%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
2.28%. So, if you think about our guide for Q1 at 2.55% to 2.65%, we have the benefit of a lot more floating rate
assets, different verticals that applies to floating rate indices. At the same time, we have a significant amount of
customers that are rolling into their option period. So, for example, in Q4, we had about $0.5 billion of multi-family
loans that went to SOFR for plus 2.25% or 2.50%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
2.50%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
2.50%. Coming off a 3% coupon. So that's adding to the benefit of repricing. But when you think about the
choices going forward, absent the funding side, on the asset side, we really do have a unique opportunity to have
a lot more assets repricing into the marketplace, as well as a much more we'll call high yielding offering when it
comes to the floating rate instrument, and more of a focus to allow our customers to utilize derivatives to finance
their long-terms as an alternative solution than traditional fixed rate terms.
So we've been proactive on running out the capital markets activity that Flagstar offers to their customers to some
of our larger multi-family players that are doing larger transactions [indiscernible] (00:50:00) structure for the
balance sheet. So we really do have an interesting series of choices on the verticals to really drive capital into
businesses that are high yielding businesses.
That being said, the funding is where you have still pressure. Obviously, I indicated about a 4%, 5% liability
sensitivity as we closed the books at year-end. But that's going to have a couple more rate hikes. And, obviously,
the forward curve has a pause for a while. So we're going to deal with that. But ultimately, we think we can move
that 5% to neutrality very quickly depending on where we want to position some of these assets.

So, I think we can have higher margins, going back to my point. We're starting in the low 2s. We're already in the
mid-2s as we start the year. So it's a different margin business given that we have new asset classes going into
2023. And with the focus of really building out more C&I business as a hallmark for the company in addition to our
legacy businesses, which we're going to support, we'll have a lot more choices, Steven, which will drive margin.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Do you think you can hold that – because next quarter is going to be the first quarter where we have the
new company, right, for the full quarter. Do you think you can hold NIM in this 1Q range beyond the first quarter,
through the rest of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
You're not going to get me to a point to give forward guidance in the margin. That's a good try. Look, we typically
give Q1 – we give a three-month outlook on margin. I think the unique opportunity here is that we have a different
balance sheet. We have a different positioning. We have unique asset classes and we're still challenged as all
banks are challenged on the funding side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
If we could be successful in moving some of these wholesale liabilities into – to core deposits, then it's a game-
changer for our multiple. That's the strategy. That's not going to be an overnight strategy. We've done a lot of
work over the past 2.5 years, but we're starting the year very strong with a solid margin compared to a stand-
alone NYCB, with the benefits of a much higher average margin for the year knowing that we're going to have
probably an increase tomorrow and another increase in March, which will hit all banks in respect to excess
liquidity, including NYCB. And we still have to contend with our liability funding on the wholesale side that's
repricing, and then it will stabilize.

Yeah. The only other item and we mentioned it earlier on the government-as-a-service deposits, right. We had
that program really kick off at the end of 2022. And then now we start to see, really, the utilization of those funds
that we're seeing that start to roll down as we would have expected in the first quarter. And that is noninterest-

bearing accounts. So, that's just another item for – that we'll see that's beneficial in the first quarter that we lose a
lot of that benefit when we go forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I would add that, internally, when we look at the business even on the multi-family side, going back to 2012,
2013, we had a high fee income opportunity and the actual yield on that asset class is much higher because of
the propensity of prepayment. We ended the year this year at the lowest level of prepayment activity compared to
the financial crisis. Literally, if you go back, it was significantly lower than we had anticipated, and we had a very
strong year. We had another record year in earnings, but you get – the multiple is what it is. We were liability
sensitive.
But if you think about where we ended up about $45 million in total prepayment activity. If you go back to 2013,
that number was $140 million. So we're up by over $100 million, and the portfolio is probably substantially larger
than it is today than it was back in 2013. So, there's tremendous opportunity to really get that coupon from a 3%
coupon to the markets and be very cognizant of the fee embedded in that structure to drive margin.
But we have a very conservative estimate in our forecast internally, even though we don't go out the full year of
how this asset class will react because the asset class is very stable right now. There is no activity on prepay.
There is no large purchase transaction activity. We think that will change once rates start to become more
expected based on the borrowing base. Right now, customers are not doing a whole lot. So, we're kind of having
a larger balance sheet with lower yields. And as they reprice, we're getting a nice benefit on that particular core
asset class.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Tom, if I could also ask, so if I look at the guidance, the average loan growth of around 5% for full year
2023, which doesn't make sense because you have Flagstar for full year of 2023. What's the base that you're
comparing that to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Look, we're very conservative right now. It's early in the year. Last year, we had 10% loan growth on multi-family.
A lot of that was driven because market conditions have changed. Like I indicated, we're not going to have the
activity until customers are comfortable on pulling down equity and buying and selling asset classes. That's not
happening in the marketplace today. So, you're going to have a larger asset class for longer.
But I think we have a conservative model that we're going to be very focused on making sure we get the best
economics given the market condition. And, Steven, as you know, it's expensive right now to finance short-term.
So, when you look at, let's say, a three-year average life financing against a multi-family credit with a three-year
average life, we need to get paid economically. That number is around 6% in the market, 2.25% off the five-year
treasury. And that's where we're holding our line. I think that's the right economics for us as we look at the lines of
businesses.
So, when you think about 5% net loan growth, that's reasonable. And we always come out with a conservative
estimate. If it changes, it changes. But it's early on, and given that most customers are really kind of sitting on the

sidelines trying to figure out what their funding needs are going to be in a very unique, changing interest rate
environment, I think it's reasonable.
Warehouse could change dramatically...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
...dramatically, if these rates go down. If for some reason we're in a different rate environment towards the back
end of this year, we have $11.5 billion warehouse book that has about $3 billion outstanding. That number could
double very quickly. So, we have an opportunity at very high spreads, along with some of the other lines of
businesses.
So, we really are being conservative and we want to be conservative. So, 10% was a big year for us on a stand-
alone basis. And if you take Flagstar's SOFR investment portfolio out of the resi side, they were relatively flat or
down slightly for the year given the challenge in the mortgage business.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2023
Hey. Good morning. Hey. Good morning, everybody. John, just make sure I'm clear on the expenses. The
midpoint of your guide is pretty good to consensus, call it, $50 million or $60 million. The amortization expense,
need a little help there. It looks like it was $5 million, which would annualize about $60 million. Is that about the
right amortization expense for the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, it is. When you look at, there's change in the interest rate environment, not only did it have impacts on the
purchase accounting adjustments for loans and securities, but also of CDI. I think originally we expected CDI to
be at a much lower number when we announced the deal. But it's definitely changed given this interest rate
environment. So, yeah, when you look at that – all intangible amortizations, that $5 million a month is a good run
rate for 2023.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. On the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, that excludes amortization of CDI. That's exclusive of amortization.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, it makes sense. It looks like they offset each other. In terms of the accretion, John, any – what's the
accretable yield that might be considered in the guide or how should we think about accretion income as a margin
contributor?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, the way to think about it is, we have benefits coming in from accretion from the loan in the securities
side. And that partially offsets some CDs, subdebt, and the trust preferreds. So, you're looking probably, on
average, in the $10 million range, I would say, from an accretion perspective per month that we'll probably see.
The hard part about getting exact guidance on that is when you look at the Flagstar loan portfolio especially, even
some of the securities portfolios, that the floating rate pieces are marked pretty close to par, if not really at par
from an interest rate risk perspective.
Some of the more fixed rate items has much deeper discounts. So, it really depends on the speeds that start to
come in on those. So, we're trying to be conservative as to the speed in which those discounts will come back to
us. But you could see some swings in that as payoffs come because you've got to recapture some of those pretty
big discounts as you go forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Just to put my accounting hat on, offsetting that in 2024, assuming most of the CDs are short term, then
that discount – then the premium will be gone, and you have the possibility of higher accretion in the [ph] following
year (00:59:13).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. The CD market is – yeah, is definitely a little bit shorter than the security and the loan mark, yeah.

for sale? And the guide for mid-single digit, I'm looking at your average balance sheet, is that off a $56 billion

Great. Morning. Thanks. Good morning, Tom. Can you just give an update on the capital priorities going forward
and maybe some thoughts on share buybacks?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'll start out with the first priority. Our dividend will continue at the current rate, and that's been a priority
historically, and we're very confident there. Obviously, we had a substantial – an accounting event at year-end.
Markets have changed and we had to deal with that in respect to capital. So we traded some of the book value
benefits to earnings accretion going forward on the capital side that did have an impact.
That being said, I'll defer to John specifically on how we're going to get that back and obviously, where our capital
stack currently sits. But going back to my priority is, we're going to continue paying the current dividend rate for
the combined shareholder base.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Historically, the company has had a multifaceted capital plan when it's a – from payback to shareholders with
dividends and years ago, stock repurchases, of course. So, first, the use of capital, as Tom said, is the dividend;
and second is for growth. So any excess capital that we have after those two things, we would absolutely look at
down the road of potential buyback as market conditions dictate.

John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Well, both on office and really throughout [ph] this year (01:02:30) the portfolio has been unbelievably
strong from a credit perspective. We've seen no transition into the 30-day to 89-day buckets, or delinquency
buckets. Really, no real concerns even that have come out of the deferred loan process that we went through.
Payments have been as we would have expected. So, we've really started to see a little bit of occupancy kick up

pandemic.

And, again, it goes back to the history, as John indicated, we're not seeing any negative trends and the LTV is
relatively low. And in the event that we have to sit down and deal with a situation that has maybe some of credit
deterioration, we think we're well protected as a sponsorship as well as overall value. I haven't seen any negative
trends, Peter. It's been very, very solid.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
It looks like, I think, we have about $1 billion – we have about $1.23 billion that's coming up in total CRE. That's
not office...

John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
It's not just office.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
[ph] And that cut out to (01:04:08) 5.68% coupon. That coupon is probably closer to seven-and-change now. And
then, next year in 2024 is about another $1 billion. So, we don't have a ton of money. It looks like it's 50% of the
CRE book over the next two years coming due. And next year, I think it's a 5% to 10% coupon. So, again, we
think we have a rate potential on repricing them, but when you look at the average LTV, I'm not sure if you have
that on you, John. It's a pretty low average LTV.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
56%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. 56% on average LTV.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
On office.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
On office. And I think we feel pretty confident that – again, we haven't seen at all any deterioration. As John
indicated, the 30-day bucket, the delinquency buckets are zero.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Zero.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We feel pretty good about that. And given the current environment. But in the event we – even during the
pandemic, we had a handful of customers that were thinking about maybe having issues and we gave them some
balance sheet. We gave them some relief. And, ultimately, we got them through the other side. And in the event
there was any maneuverability on their end, we're very comfortable in exiting the asset class.
And there's plenty of investors that will look at these assets as, we'll call them unique New York City assets that
will be well owned – would love to be owned by investors that are comfortable on taking the keys from the bank if
necessary. We haven't had to have that problem so far. But in the event we do, we have low leverage and we
have strong sponsorships. So hopefully, the sponsors stay strong and if they have to kick in some more equity to
keep them going, that's the expectation.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A

We haven't had to have those conversations yet, but we're very focused on conservative underwriting. And that's

[indiscernible] (01:05:50) relationship/sponsorship type transactions that we're very comfortable that historically in

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Just to clarify, the $10 million a month of accretable yield, is that just for the first quarter of – I'm assuming the
fourth quarter this year, the first quarter 2023? And if it's not, could you give us some sense for the cadence of
accretable yield in 2023? Usually, it's pretty front-end loaded. I just want to get a sense for the cadence there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, it can be front-end loaded, no doubt. But that's the average. That's what I would assume for 2023.
You will have – like I said, when you have some big discounts and you do have some payoffs, you can have
some spikes here and there. But, no, I don't expect it to be dramatically different than that in 2023.

CD runoff will start really in 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Which will benefit 2024's number as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then just on the core NIM components, could you give us the year-end spot rate on interest-bearing
deposits? And then, what are incremental multi-family and commercial real estate yields coming on it today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'll go to the yield. So, Matt, we're looking at, like I indicated, we're pushing towards 2.25%-ish with the five year,
trying to hover around 6% on a traditional five-year deal. Commercial is probably another 50 bps above that.
We're not really doing any long-term financing. And if we do long-term financing, we're really pushing our capital
markets group to sit down with the customer and structure something synthetically which does change the
economics for the bank, as well as for the customer. So we're giving them more choices.
I indicated a lot of our customers that aren't doing a whole lot, they have an option and the option was a very
expensive option. We gave them a third option, which is a SOFR option, which is 2.50% off of SOFR, and SOFR
has been rising. So, it's not as attractive as it was six months ago, but it's an alternative and we're seeing
probably half of our customers on the multi-family side opt into that choice which we like that for interest rate risk
balance sheet management perspective, but a much higher coupon.
I think I indicated the commercial side was repricing, but in 2023, we have about another $2.5 billion, around
3.88% on the multi side. And if you take in over the next two years, it's about $6 billion on multi, with like a 3.70%,
3.75% coupon and market yields are around 6%, assuming they all go into a five-year structure.
Not doing a whole lot of 7-year, 10-year. We're reluctant to do that as we look at the marketplace and, in general,
I think people are sitting on the sidelines right now. So, we're getting the benefit of repricing just from the
optionality of them making a choice. And in very rare circumstances, you're seeing property transactions.
So, we could have a higher balance for longer because there's less activity. As indicated in my previous comment
there's very little economics in our internal forecasts for prepayment activity. I think we had probably one of our
worst years last year. We still had strong – it was a record year on earnings. We had $46 million of prepay going
back to the high at about $140 million in previous years, going back to 2013.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2023
So, we have the opportunity here for great economics if the marketplace changes, but we're assuming that it's
going to be relatively benign. So, we're not – even in our first quarter guide, we said that prepayments are not
going to be impactful in any meaningful way going forward in this current rate environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. I appreciate that. And then on the spot rate on interest-bearing deposits at year-end, quarter-end?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. At year-end, the spot rate on interest-bearing deposits is 2.17%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Matt, just one point. So, I want to talk about some of the other lines of business. I mean, we have a great builder
finance business. That number is close to 400 bps spread off of – repricing off of SOFR indices. We have fees
involved in those types of businesses. We have the warehouse business at a substantial spread in the 200-basis-
point spread. We look at that as a great opportunity because we know that business very well. We're very
comfortable with that business; clearly, a very attractive yielding business.
And we have other C&I businesses that are part of the legacy Flagstar coming over that we think we're going to
grow very nicely on a combined basis. Those spreads are very high. They're not near what we are typically
accustomed to. They're floating rate. They have fees. They have structure behind them. And they very good
incremental benefits to the margin, which is going to be a capital deployment opportunity in 2023 and beyond.
That is the game-changer that we're putting together here. So, we're not just that one bank that does one thing.
So, we have many, many verticals with different opportunity. And we're I'm going to be very cautious given the
rate environment to deploy capital to ensure we have the best capital allocation story to talk about as we build the
new Flagstar.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
No. Understood, Tom. I appreciate all that. I did want to also touch on the government-as-a-service deposits. Just
consider, it comes in in lumps and then it sounds like as it's spent, it winds down. Could you give us a sense for
the pace of attrition on the government-as-a service deposits? And is it expected to roll off to a near zero towards
the end of the year, or is it something that holds a residual balance and can grow off of that residual year-over-
year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, I'm going to start and I'm going to defer to John. He's done a lot of work around expectation and modeling and
doing regression analysis on how this would react. And we actually have experience with the stimulus payments
and how long they've held on balance sheet. More than we expected. So, we conservatively model it, which is in
our model. So, we had a large benefit in the fourth quarter that came from the California stimulus opportunity that
we were the BIN provider for. It's holding better than expected. Probably it will be there for longer than expected,
but we model it conservatively.

Ultimately, that will go down to a tail to a point, and John can get into some details on the tail. At the same time,
we have other ones ramping up in 2023. Although not the same type of program, they'll be consistent with
unemployment programs that we manage. We have a larger relationship with Jersey and others.
We just picked up a big win recently with California, which will be a substantial benefit for the bank once it gets
geared up. Again, it's the timing of it, Matt. It could happen in Q2, Q3. It really is as quick as government gets it up
and running, and we're ready to react. But it's been a good business for us and there's some fees involved. But,
more importantly, the average cost of those liabilities are very low [indiscernible] (01:12:37) zero in most cases.
And, John, if you want to talk about some of the trends...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. We've tried to model it. We've been pretty close to the modeling we saw with the economic impact stimulus
payments. So, there is a tail that will sit around, but the bulk of the deposits do go pretty quickly; and then, you
have like a slow draw after that. So, yeah, we will have deposits. I would assume is the end of the year, I don't
think it's going to be that material of a number by then, but the first quarter will still have a really nice average
balance, then will start to come down from there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Understood. And then what are the remaining onetime costs from the deal and the mortgage restructuring,
and then could you give us a sense for timing throughout the year when they'll be taken?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Let Lee talk about the mortgage restructuring. John will get into some guesstimates on what we think we're going
– we have left. Go ahead, Lee.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Senior Executive Vice President & President-Mortgage, Flagstar Bank, FSB
Yeah. Sure. So, the costs with the restructuring that we've just [ph] factioned (01:13:29) we estimate to be $12
million to $13 million, and that is predominantly severance. But, as I mentioned earlier, there are some leases that
we need to get out of. So there's some costs associated with that. There's a couple of contracts that we are also
going to exit. We're going to isolate that as a restructuring charge, and we will take that in the first quarter.
In addition, we probably need 60 days, that's what we're estimating, to work off the pipeline those loans that are
locked that are not yet closed of those offices that we've closed down. So, that'll take us through the end of
March. And that's why earlier, I mentioned that even though you're going to start seeing cost savings starting in
February, there is noise as a result of the onetime restructuring charge, the run-off of the pipeline, and I expect us
to have a real clean run rate beginning April 1.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And then on the merger-related charges, we'll see some in the next couple of quarters when it comes to primarily
severance and just some consulting work to get through the consolidation of the two companies. So, you'll see

that as well in the coming quarters. And then, there'll be some charges when we get to Q1 of 2024 when we get to
the conversion date.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. Last one for is just overall capital levels. Tangible equity at 6.4%. Your total risk-based capital ratio is
sub-12%. Should we be contemplating any sort of common equity raise or sub debt raise to bolster these ratios?
That's all I had. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Matt. I think given where the capital ratios are and just given the credit nature of the two balance
sheet – the two legacy banks' balance sheet and the limited risk really from a charge-off and a provisioning
perspective, we're comfortable where the capital ratios are. With a common equity Tier 1 ratio over 9%, that's a
good spot for us to be, given the loss content in those portfolios. So, it's something we're going to, of course,
continue to manage. And we believe the best use of the capital right now is primarily dividends; then, of course, to
fund growth. And then going forward, we can look at other capital initiatives depending on market conditions.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q

I had a similar question as Matt on the capital. So, would the 9.06% likely grow from here or is there a scenario
where it may dip a little bit as the balance sheet is considered quarter-to-quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think it would grow [indiscernible] (01:16:19).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, the goal is to grow. I mean, it depends a little bit. One of the things we look at when we put both
companies together is there's a large portion of the assets that even though they have really low loss content in
them, including multi-family, mortgage, warehouse, they're 100% risk-weighted assets. So, we do have that, that
we have to kind of work through from a capital perspective. But the goal is over time to ensure our capital ratios
are where we want them to be in our capital target. So, that's no doubt the plan.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. And last question...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Just to be clear with that. We've traded off capital for accretion on the adjustment given the changes in interest
rates. So, you're getting a lot of, as John indicated, benefit as far as the marks on the assets and liabilities. So,
that does have an impact to get that back over time. So, we think you'll see some nice earnings per share growth
as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got it. And then last question, John, just has to do with how the banking-as-a-service and government-as-a-
service reprices over time. Do you have to have an absolute Fed cut before you can lower those rates, thinking
out just a couple of quarters from now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
The government-as-a-service deposits are primarily noninterest-bearing; or if they are, they're really specific
exactly what those costs would be. On banking-as-a-service deposits, to see big cuts, you'd probably have to –
see big drops in those rates, you probably have to see some Fed cuts especially in this environment. But times
change, and sooner or later the spreads can narrow a little bit on what you're paying for a lot of those products.
But I think we'd have to start to see a Fed pivot before we start to see some significant savings there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. And are those banking-as-a-service [indiscernible] (01:18:12) maybe three-quarters or two-thirds if the Fed
moves? Is that about right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, there are range. Some are 100% beta and some are in that 75% range. So, on the banking-as-a-
service side, it's a range of what's tied to the change.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, I'm back. I'm so sorry. I know it's been a long call. Just one question, Tom. I think you mentioned multiple
times around becoming a commercial bank, multiple expansion for the stock. Give us a sense of what you think
this combined franchise as we look beyond system conversion next year. Like, if you have any sense of where
you think the bank is from a ROTC, ROA perspective? What the franchise should be earning in a steady state
environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, look, I mean, this is obviously going to be a block and tackle year. We're super excited about putting these
companies together. The rebranding effort that's going to take place. We are transitioning to some great
technology that's going to really assist our customer base as we move towards commercial banking. We've got to
work a lot on the funding side. And the company is going to be – historically over the past couple of years we're
earning just under 15% TCE, we should be in the high-teens.
And I think the reality in the high-teens, on a traditional multiple perspective with return on assets well north of
1%, 1.10%, 1.20%-ish, over time, it's going to take some work here, but the reality is that the balance sheet has
changed dramatically. If you think about the lines of businesses that we're going to have, the verticals that we'll
reprice, very different than historical fixed rate lender that had vulnerabilities to rising interest rates. So, we want
to be better balanced.
At the same time, we're going to get our cost structure right. We have work to do, going back to 2023 as a block
and tackle year, and we look at 2024 and, hopefully, a different rate environment, we'll be able to take advantage
of a better funding mix. We're going to go after the deposit funding. If we move that positioning to having better
funding as a core competency of our number one priority, that will change multiple.
We feel very strongly that mortgage on a percentage basis, because the bank is much larger, will be less of a
concentration on total income stream. So, we want to have less dependency on mortgage, less dependency in
wholesale finance. And we believe that will give us a better blended multiple. And multiple expansion is going to
be key as we look at the transformation to a commercial bank.
We have all the plots in place. It's going to take time to block and tackle, but we have the road map. And the
system conversion will be done in the first quarter 2024. At the same time, we're going to be rolling out the
verticals, proving to the marketplace that we're allocating capital to different lines of businesses that have better
margin businesses.

combined basis where, historically, we had limited choices when we had our business model. So, we're excited
