In addition, these remarks may include certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. A
presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP
measures to the comparable GAAP measures will be available on Pinnacle Financial's website at www.pnfp.com.
With that, I'm going to turn the presentation over to Mr. Terry Turner, Pinnacle's President and CEO.

M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, Matt. Hopefully, everybody knows we're going to start with this snapshot. Our primary objective here
is total shareholder return, and we believe these are the best metrics to ensure we get that done. As always, we
begin with the GAAP measures. But for me, in quarters like this where there's a lot of noise, the non-GAAP
measures are perhaps more revealing.
This quarter, our Treasury management team here did some extraordinary work, in my opinion, to reposition our
securities book, which, of course, creates a loss on the sale of securities in this period, but provides a meaningful
lift to our ongoing revenue and earnings run rate with what we expect to be a slightly better than three-year
payback and it increased both tangible book value and risk-based capital at the same time, a really elegant and
value-creating strategy.
So, looking at the non-GAAP metrics, in general, the objective is to have all the balance sheet and P&L metrics
moving steadily up and to the right. That's been the case for the better part of our 24-year existence.
Unfortunately, as everyone knows, over the last couple of years, earnings for banks have had to recalibrate given
the extraordinary impacts of rapidly rising interest rates and an inverted yield curve.
Harold tells the story about two campers awakened in the night by a big bear. One of the camper stopped to put
his tennis shoes on and tie them up and the other camper asked him, do you really think you can outrun that
bear? They said, well, I don't know if I can outrun that bear. I just have to outrun you. And so I hated that this
calibration's been required, but I believe that we're outrunning most of our peers.
If you look across the top row, this quarter, you see an inflection point for revenue, EPS, and adjusted PPNR, and
you see those lifts even as we're attracting record numbers of revenue producers and supporting them with
incremental facilities. The truth is our opportunities to invest in the ongoing growth of our revenue, EPS, and
PPNR has even better than we would have projected.
Turning to balance sheet growth, I'm very encouraged by the underlying growth going on there. Harold will review
the numbers in greater detail. But, quickly, in a market with prolonged contractions in money supply, many are
unable to grow client deposits. But as a result of building important specialty deposit products, we're able to grow
the client deposits and grow them fast enough to allow us to remix the deposit book away from higher-cost broker
deposits.
In the case of loans, our current growth rate is outsized, albeit less than we had originally hoped. Most are aware
that we began a strategic reduction of our CRE as a function of risk-based capital 18 to 24 months ago. These
targets are currently 70% or less of risk-based capital allocated to construction and 225% or less allocated to total
CRE. We've been travelling pretty fast in the construction bucket. It's now down to 72.5%, so we're rapidly
approaching our target layer. In dollars, our various categories of CRE loans contracted $76 million during the
quarter, which highlights the underlying success we're having among our commercial and industrial clients.

So, the quarter's numbers have a lot of noise, but the strength of the underlying growth is remarkable. I'd
comment across the bottom row, you can get a snapshot of asset quality. While net charge-offs ticked up 27 basis
points in the quarter, we continue to guide the 25 basis points on the year with virtually no problem loan formation
at this point.
So, Harold, let me turn it over to you to let you review the numbers in detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. We will start with loans, which came in a little less than we anticipated.
As a result, we're lowering our outlook slightly for loan growth to 7% to 9% growth. We believe our growth will still
be outsized compared to our peers. We also still believe that we're doing a great job on spreads, particularly for
prime and SOFR-based credit. New volumes were coming in at essentially the same spread as the existing
books, so we're pleased in this difficult-at-best-to-grow-loans environment.
One of the keys to our financial plan is increasing repricing on our renewals of fixed rate loans. As the slide
indicates, we're expecting about $2 billion in cash flows from our fixed rate loan portfolio coming in over the
remainder of 2024, with an average yield of around 4.7%. As the fixed rate loans originated in the first half of
2024, our average yields were around 7.25%. So, a meaningful increase over prior yields. Our second quarter
yields were only 7.08% on new loans, so we have some work to do in the second half of 2024.
Our loan growth targets we believe for the second half of 2024 should show better than the first half. Interest rate
cuts will help some, but in the end, we believe it's about borrowers being more confident about the economy,
eliminating uncertainties, and needing to borrow for growth capital. Our competitive advantage is that we have
new lenders that are ready to move market share.
To that point, approximately 25% of our revenue producers have been with us for less than two years.
Accordingly, we have great optimism about Jacksonville, Washington, and Atlanta. By the way, Atlanta had
another great quarter both as to loan growth and recruiting as Atlanta brought in some very interested bankers in
the second quarter. And based on what I hear from them in Atlanta, they should have a great third quarter.
We believe we had another strong quarter on deposit growth. Excluding the decrease in broker deposits, we
increased client deposits by more than $700 million, the second quarter having essentially the same result as that
of the first quarter. We're pleased with that effort as the second quarter is usually our most difficult deposit growth
quarter given tax outflows in April. You will also notice that we've moved quite a bit of our deposits into the
indexed deposit product category. Almost 40% of our deposits are now indexed to Fed funds. As we prepare for a
better rate environment, this should obviously be helpful.
As to 2024 deposit growth, we have lowered our deposit volume forecast to within a range of mid to high single
digits this year. Some of that is due to our reducing the loan volume forecast, thus putting less pressure on
deposit growth. We also plan to reduce reliance on the more expensive wholesale deposits this year. That said,
our efforts to grow client core deposits remain as energized as ever.
What the Fed does will obviously impact our rate projections for the remainder of the year, but more on that in a
second. We do believe our deposit beta has served us well here as we are probably in better shape than most as
we head into a down rate cycle. As we said before, we continue to like our competitive position as to deposit rates
in our markets. Since the last June, our weighted average deposit rates have increased only 33 basis points, and

that includes the impact of the last 25-basis-point raise in July of 2023, 12 months ago. In my opinion, our
relationship managers have done an amazing job in managing our deposit costs over the last year.
As Terry said in the press release last night, we believe we finally experienced an inflection with a meaningful
increase in margin in the second quarter with 3.14%. We expect more margin expansion to come in the second
half of 2024. As to net interest income growth, we are maintaining our growth rate at 8% to 10% for this year. We
have kept our interest rate forecast at two cuts but delayed the first not happening until November. That said,
given the volatility of the data, we could see cuts in September [ph] are probably the best to (00:10:17) determine
that no rate cuts will occur this year. We still believe, absent some really unusual action by the Fed, two rate cuts
or no rate cuts, our 2024 margin forecast seems to come in at a fairly higher range from here.
The big news from a balance sheet management perspective was the reposition of the bond book, the credit
default swaps, and all the other actions we've discussed pretty early in the press release last night. We've been
working on this for quite some time and finally got all the pieces in place to where we could execute and achieve
all of the objectives we wanted to achieve. We have been planning this for several months and a portion of the
increased revenue we had planned to achieve from the repositioning was considered in our outlook for net
interest income growth last quarter. That's why we've elected to hold our net interest income outlook of 8% to
10% growth consistent. More on this when I get to the outlook slide a little later, but to say we're pleased with how
all this turned out would be a great understatement.
We continue to work on other less impactful initiatives that hopefully will also bolster our revenue run rate. So, at
June 30, is PNFP ready for a rate down interest rate cycle? We think our balance sheet is in great shape and
well-positioned. Our deposit beta was relatively high all the way up. We believe it will be as strong all the way
down. Our sales force is set up to work with clients once these rate cuts begin.
As for credit, we're again presenting our traditional credit metrics. We mentioned one $10 million charge-off of an
owner-occupied commercial real estate credit in the press release last night. That situation deteriorated in the
second quarter. Thus, we accepted the bid for the collateral, even though it meant $10 million in incremental
charge-offs. Our special asset group leaders felt doing so was our best play. We're still working with the non-
performing credit we mentioned last quarter. Our special asset group officers are still working with that borrower
to minimize lost content for that one.
As to our outlook for charge-offs, we're maintaining our guidance with a range of 20 to 25 basis points for 2024.
We've also included additional guidance around provisioning in relation to average loans with a range of 31 to 36
basis points. Since our loan growth outlook is less, this should result in reduced loan loss provision, all else equal.
Loan growth is one of the biggest factors impacting our provision, and that as we grow loans, we have to build our
CECL reserve at greater than 1% of loan growth. So, fewer loans results in less net interest income, but also less
provision.
So, after all of that, where is credit? No real change in what feels like now for several quarters. Our charts from
past dues and potential problem loans indicate we are operating at near-historic lows, which should be a
meaningful indicator as to where credit experience should be headed. The outlook for reduced rates on the short
end has to be a good sign, particularly for less affluent consumers and small businesses that just don't have the
balance sheet that perhaps larger borrowers have.
More about commercial real estate. And just so you know, we begin to add in more information on credit primarily
for non-owner-occupied commercial real estate and construction in the supplemental slides. Our non-owner-
occupied and construction portfolio continues to perform very well. We continued to push for lower exposure for
5

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
construction. Our target of 70% of total risk-based capital, we believe, will be achieved before year-end 2024. Our
appetite, as noted by the almost solid red table on the bottom right, is unchanged and we don't anticipate
meaningful change this year.
That said, we continue to have some interest in high quality warehouse and some multifamily, but, again, let me
stress, any new commitments to this space are limited to strategic client relationships only and no way should
anyone perceive we're on any sort of offense here. All things considered, we like our commercial real estate book.
I know many of you know this, our home limits are very modest. We pride ourselves on a granular book. Our
largest ticket sizes for our bank are conservative in comparison to what we hear from other franchises. We just
don't seek out the high profile, bulky projects.
Now, on to fees, and as always, I'll speak to BHG in a few minutes. Excluding BHG and various other
nonrecurring items, fee revenues were up 6.8% linked quarter. We're pleased to report that our wealth
management units had a strong first half and fully expect the efforts of our wealth management professionals will
continue for the rest of the year. The fees associated with bank blocking and tackling are also doing quite well.
Service charges and interchange both showing linked-quarter gains of 8% and 12% respectively. All in, we're
again raising guidance for core fee revenues this year. A range of 14% to 17% seems reasonable given the
performance of several of our primary business lines in the first half of the year.
Second quarter expenses came in about where we thought they would after you back out the expenses
connected with our balance sheet repositioning. Importantly, we're increasing our incentive target from 80% to
85% payout for fiscal year 2024. Again, we are raising target points to the fact that we believe 2024 will be better
than we thought at the end of last quarter. And as you know, the direct linkage between our financial performance
and our incentive plan is closely correlated, and thus we can't raise one without believing that the other will move
up as well. Additionally, our hiring was really strong in the second quarter with 52 new revenue producers
recruited compared to 39 in the first quarter. Going into the third quarter, our recruiting pipelines are very strong
across the franchise. Terry will speak more to this in a few minutes.
With the increase in incentives, strong revenue producer hiring, and the call it $4 million impact of loss protection
fees on the credit default swaps, we've elected to increase our expense outlook to $960 million to $990 million for
the year.
Lastly, we've presented this slide from time to time. Bringing it back this time because of the bottom book
repositioning and just as a reinforcement about how important tangible book value growth is to this firm. Sure,
growing earnings is critical, but as many bank investors know, keeping a keen focus on compounding tangible
book value growth is just as critical. Our tangible book value fared well during the rate upcycle as we elected to
maintain a bond book that minimized our exposure to AOCI hit. Even after we executed a significant repositioning
in the second quarter, our tangible book value and Common Equity Tier 1 Ratios expanded along with most of our
other capital ratios.
Now to BHG. As the slide indicates, originations picked up in the second quarter, which was good news, and
better result than anticipated. Last quarter, we stated that a higher-for-longer rate environment could impact the
production assumptions for the year. As a result, BHG believes second half 2024 production will be consistent
with the first half. This results in lower production targets for 2024 in the wake of higher-for-longer and a tighter
credit loss.
As to placements, total placements were less than originations, which was the opposite from the prior two
quarters. This was by design as BHG's total inventory was as thin as it's been in approximately three years and
6

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
BHG is needing to build inventory for larger future orders this year. Also still great demand for BHG paper, both
from the auction platform and the institutional buyers. They've successfully accomplished an ABS issuance in the
first quarter and now thinking the first quarter of 2025 will likely be the next time they find another such issuance.
This is due to competing orders that have been previously negotiated from larger institutional buyers.
As to spreads, auction platform spread did widen during the second quarter to 8.7%. Balance sheet loan spreads
are fairly consistent with [indiscernible] (00:18:39) All in, BHG believes spreads are holding even in this higher
rate environment. BHG still believes, when rate decreases do begin, that would be good news for them, not only
from a volume perspective but also from a spread perspective.
On reserves, BHG did increase reserves in the first quarter for off-balance-sheet loans, but decreased reserves
for on-balance-sheet loans. There was a modest uptick in the second quarter credit losses for the off-balance-
sheet business, which – with the actual expense related to credit loss for off-balance-sheet now at 3.4%. On-
balance-sheet losses were up also to 7.2%. So, even though the percentage for on-balance-sheet losses
increased in the second quarter, the actual dollar amount for on-balance-sheet losses decreased. A similar
circumstance occurred last quarter. Average balances fell faster than actual losses, which is why the percentage
loss was higher.
BHG believes that they are substantially through the credit issues with respect to the on-balance-sheet portfolio.
Loans held off-balance-sheet by the bank still needs some time, perhaps three to four quarters. Data reflect that
65% of the current losses are attributable to the January 2022 through June 2023 vintage credit. The news does
keep getting better given BHG's past dues continue to improve and hopefully head to pre-COVID levels soon.
As to the forward look for origination of earnings, and as we mentioned last time, achieving the same level of
originations as last year would take great effort in the higher-for-longer rate environment, especially given BHG is
not interested in adjusting their credit models to achieve volume goals. As I mentioned earlier, BHG's second half
of 2024 production should approximate first half's. So, as you look at the chart, it should look a lot like 2021
production levels. As to earnings, BHG is also anticipating that the second half will likely look like the first half. For
PNFP, that represents a decrease from [ph] prior results (00:20:44) of 10% to 15%.
BHG always has tactics they can deploy to help their bottom line and increase near-term earnings. They've exited
business lines and trimmed their expensive base. The second quarter of 2024 did include the loss of
approximately $12 million related to exiting their SBA business line. The leadership of BHG has made several
strategic decisions concerning their business model aimed at creating a more sustainable business model
regardless of the economic climate. The credit pain from the COVID overhang has been real, but I don't think I
have ever seen the leadership more optimistic about the near term and putting all of that behind. Our partnership
with the BHG remains as strong as ever.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Terry.

Thanks, Harold. Over the last couple of years, we've been through a liquidity crisis as the Fed began draining the
money supply. We've had a rapidly rising interest rate cycle, an inverted yield curve, increasing credit costs as
credit began to normalize with genuine fear about where the credit costs could go in a recessionary environment,
and a slowing economy which limits the incremental loan demand. That's made it hard on bank stock investors.
But I believe Pinnacle offers an extraordinary opportunity for folks that need to own bank stocks. Our well-
documented, sustainable competitive advantage, which is built on a relentless focus on the work environment in

order to attract and retain the best bankers in our markets, enables us to leverage our best-in-class service and
advice to move their clients from vulnerable competitors. The result is outsized growth through thick and thin with
outstanding asset quality.
And if we can consistently take share from the market share leaders in our market, we can compound earnings
faster and more reliably than peers, even in a difficult operating environment. It's how we produce value for
shareholders during difficult times, and it's a way to realize extraordinary value for shareholders when markets
turn bullish and multiples expand.
One of the hardest jobs I have is to help investors separate Pinnacle from all the other banks that say they have a
great culture. It's unlikely any banker is going to declare their culture is unremarkable, but maybe you can ask
them where they rank on Fortune's list of the best companies in America to work for. You can see on the top left,
we're number 11. No traditional bank rank higher.
Maybe you can ask how many revenue producers they attract into their firm from their major competitors. On the
top right, it looks like we'll have a record-setting year even for a long, long time prolific hirer of revenue producers.
But it's not just about how many they were able to hire. Perhaps you can see how fast they lose them because
turnover is the number one way to demolish service levels and ultimately damage financials. So, what's their
associate retention rate? You can see on the bottom right, our annual associate retention rate is roughly 95%,
and it's that year-in and year-out.
So, be critical. Some won't carve out various pockets of turnover like people they fired or people whose spouse
got transferred or people who retired or died and so forth. For us, it's a simple measurement. If you were on the
roster last period and you're not on it this period for whatever reason, that's turnover. You can see here, that's
very minimal.
And it's not just about how many people that they hire. It's not just about how many people they keep. Perhaps
you can get them to tell you how their clients view the quality and effectiveness of their client-facing people. And
you can see on the lower left, Greenwich Associates, the foremost provider of market research to banks regarding
the commercial marketplace, says, in our eight-state footprint, businesses with sales from $1 million to $500
million believe our relationship managers are literally the best. For each of those measurements, Pinnacle is the
white dot on the range of responses for each of the top 10 competitors in our market.
They understand the industry the best. They understand Treasury management the best, and they're the best at
proactively providing effective advice. And if they can't give you answers to things like where they rank, recruiting
and retention success rates, and objective data on how clients view their relationship managers. I'm just saying
their culture is unremarkable. Answers to question like these can not only help you separate the wheat from chaff.
More importantly, they help you understand the likelihood and the reliability of their growth.
Of course, simply building a great workplace is not the endgame. The goal of creating a world-class place to work,
of attracting and retaining the best associates, is to attract and retain the best clients from other banks. Without
this market share-taking strategy, it would be hard to outgrow the market. And as a lot of folks are finding out,
undifferentiated franchises are struggling to produce any balance sheet volume at all right now.
J.D. Power says, of the largest 50 banks in the country, no one, literally no one has been able to create as
differentiated, as client engaging an experience as we have. I'm obviously excited to have the highest Net
Promoter Score among the 50 largest banks in the country. But most important is how we match up against Wells
Fargo, Truist, and Bank of America, shown in red here, because those three banks are number one, two, and
8

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
three in our market. In terms of market share, they dominate. Because of our work environment, we routinely
attract their best people. Because of the client experience, we attract their best clients. And this feels like a
sustainable competitive advantage for as far as I can see.
J.D. Power has quantified the seven metrics that contribute to the Net Promoter Score. They are; trustworthiness,
the quality of the people, ease of doing business, digital channels, account offerings, saving clients time or
money, and resolving problems. What you're looking at here is, for the above median performers among the top
50 largest banks in the country, the scores for each of those seven attributes. As you can see, we're in the
number one or two on all except digital channels, where we're number three ahead of JPMorgan.
So, the quality of the work environment and the quality of the client experience we provide is tightly woven into
our fabric in a way that would be nearly impossible to unravel. It's why our net interest income grows at a different
rate than peers. It's why we produce double-digit fee income growth in our core fee businesses. It's how we afford
to invest in the markets' best people and support them with incremental facilities in order to propel our ongoing
growth when most of our peers are cutting expenses, likely damaging their future growth prospects.
And so, not surprisingly, over the last decade, we've provided one of the leading total shareholder returns by
rapidly and reliably compounding earnings. In the table below the bar chart, you can see how much the trailing
12-month earnings increased over that decade and how the EPS multiple expanded or contracted.
High-growth stocks like PNFP have come in and out of favor. That's one of the reasons why our multiple
contracted over 40% the last decade. But even with that outsized multiple contraction, our sustained ability to hire
bankers and move their clients, our sustained ability to reliably grow balance sheet volumes even when loan
demand slack and the Fed's draining liquidity from the system, our ability to compound earnings growth through
thick and thin produced market-leading shareholder value.
So, we've demonstrated a way to get earnings growth in slack time like we're in now. And beyond that, to be
positioned for great value creation when sentiment turns, when it becomes bullish, when bank stock multiples
expand, and when growth bank stocks trade at premiums.
So, Harold, let me stop there. I'll turn it over to you to quantify our financial outlook for the remainder of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Now to the traditional slide on our outlook for 2024. As I mentioned earlier, we've lowered our
expectations in some cases and raised our expectations in others. Just to recap, for net interest income, we're
maintaining the guidance even though we lowered loan growth. We also have a meaningful increase in run rate
on the balance sheet repositioning. We're maintaining our charge-off outlook. Our outlook for provision is less this
quarter given we think loan production will be less.
Core fee income we believe will expand and we have increased our confidence levels which will serve to offset
much of the reduction from BHG. Expenses will be slightly higher primarily due to the increase in incentives, the
loss protection fee, and better than we previously thought hiring success.
In the end, we feel more confident that our 2024 outlook, given our strong performance in the second quarter, the
success of the balance sheet initiatives, and although the macro environment still has some definite uncertainties,
it feels like there is some reason to believe that some positive inflection has occurred there as well.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
With all of that, we conclude that our overall outlook for 2024 is a bit better than last quarter. All of this has to be a
good sign for 2025. We're about to start our annual planning effort for next year. Our financial goals will be the
same, top quartile revenue and top quartile earnings growth. The investments we've made in our new markets
and our hiring success, even with all the uncertainties over the past few years, are the building blocks we'll lean
into as we build our 2025 plan.
So, with that, Matt, let's open it up for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Turner (sic) [Mr. Carpenter]. Everyone, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. Great quarter from you on – Hey, guys. Great quarter from you on the growth in the
core loan portfolio. Wanted to ask, if I look at the slides on the legacy markets on 28 and 43, the legacy markets
are not growing and the deposit growth this quarter in legacy markets was lower than 1Q. How much of that is the
repositioning of the loan portfolio? And is there some slowing of growth in legacy markets kind of due to either
pricing selectivity or just you kind of already penetrated those markets and further penetration is more difficult?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, that's a great question, Brett. We do think that, over time, as lenders are with us for an extended period of
time, their growth begins to contract from a percentage perspective. That said, we always believe they'll at least
be able to keep up with the broader economy and how that's working. So, we don't lower our expectations for our
legacy markets. But we do have, as you might expect, some very high expectations for the newer markets as they
start from a lower base. I don't think we've got concerns about where we are with our legacy markets and the
growth we've got there. As you know, we're in some pretty spectacular markets and we're still looking to hire
people. But that, as we hire in these legacy markets as well, we will get this growth.

Okay. That's helpful. And then the increase in the incentive target from 80% to 85%. Obviously, your outlook is a
little better. Let's just say in the back half of the year, either the margin NII ends up being better than what you've
adjusted the target for, the 85%. Is there a relationship we can think about if the NII is $1 better? How much of
that might get taken out or taken – reduced by the incentive increase if you [indiscernible] (00:33:38) 100%?

Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I don't want to get too specific here, but there is a definite grid that's produced and we'll disclose it in next year's
proxy. So, you'll be able to work through that. There's a lot of art here, as well as science. I think what's driven our
– first of all, I'll talk about the uptick for this quarter. We've just got a lot more confidence in where we think we'll
be for this year. So, that's why we felt like we needed to increase the incentive accrual.

As for the rest of the year, should like another $1 of revenue show up or another $1 of earnings show up, it's
probably going to be somewhere around $0.20 to $0.25 will end up in that incentive accrual. But give me some
leeway on that because things do move around as we approach year-end. And in the past, we have, on occasion,
kind of taken the named executive officers and adjusted theirs downward in order to make sure we fund
everybody else's. So, I'm talking about gross numbers here with the 85%. But sometimes we do. We work with
the compensation committee of the board to adjust it.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I want to start. So, on loan growth, the second quarter was a little bit softer and you guys are taking the full year
guide down a bit. I know most of the growth has come from newer bankers moving books of business over. The
CRE runoff is a factor, too. But has the pace of movement from new bankers moving business to you guys, has
that slowed a bit here? Is that a factor?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Steve, I don't think that it really is. We work hard to try to quantify things, show the math of things, help people get
underneath the numbers, and all those kinds of things. The truth is, sort of irrespective of how things are
quantified, I rely a lot on just what my sense of where people are and those kinds of things. So, many times in a
quarter, there are things that will cause your loan number to be down. You get a few payoffs you didn't expect. A
couple of loans you thought were going to close this quarter closed next quarter. All those kinds of things move
things back and forth.

Just to cut through this, at the bottom, my belief about our pipelines going into the third quarter and fourth quarter
feel much stronger, much more vibrant than they would have, say, in the second quarter. And so, anyway, I don't
know if that's particularly helpful to you, but just trying to get you through. No, I don't think we're seeing a
slowdown in anybody's ability to move business. I just think there are odds and ends there. But it feels like to me
what gets closed in quarters three and four will be meaningfully better than what got closed in quarters one and
two.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. No, it's helpful, Terry. I'm just wondering everybody's focused on loan growth and I was wondering if peers
are doing a better job of defending share from some of the bankers they lost. But it doesn't sound that way from
your response.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
It doesn't feel like that to me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then, Harold, on the securities repositioning, I don't know if you've said this earlier, but when did that
happen in the quarter? And can you help us think about the NIM impact, net interest margin impact from that in
the third quarter like how much should that benefit the NIM?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I'll just put it to you this way. I think we gave enough information in the press release to get you to like a 3%
kind of a spread differential on the one-point-call-it-four-billion dollars we reinvested. I think if you plow that into
the NIM, you'll get some – we experienced some of that in the second quarter because we reinvested. We started
reinvesting towards the end of the second quarter and that gave us a little bit of push our NIM for – our yield on
investment securities, which ended up impacting our NIM.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. But it was back-end loaded in terms of when you did this?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We had to make sure we had all of the – the counterparty was in good shape, all of that, all the attorneys
were on the same page, all of that. And so that happened towards the call it mid to late June.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. And final question on BHG. So, there's a pretty notable change in the outlook, right? You went
from up mid-single digit for the year, now you're down 10% to 15%. Could you zoom out 30,000 feet and talk
about what's really driving the change in the expectations for net income from NIM? Thanks.

Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think they've upped the credit out. I think credit will be the most significant change for the second half of
the year from what they thought originally. And I think that's primarily attributable to the off-balance-sheet, the
auction platform loans that are out there. The pace of those banks submitting for substitution has begun to
accelerate, and so they're just anticipating more of those losses coming in the second half of the year.

Hey Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey. Maybe just going back to the discussion around the expansion markets, but looking more on the deposit
side. Is there a noticeable difference in the cost of deposits in those expansion markets? Are you using pricing on
the deposits to really drive some of that? And is that also, I guess, include ECR in that discussion as well as sort
of overall interest expense?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think I would say generally the answer to your question on are we using price to move the clients, I don't
think that we are. There's no doubt if you're moving a client from another bank you're probably not going to get
them to come over and accept a substantially lower interest rate. So, to the extent you're moving at a high point in
the cycle, it might be a higher rate than what your average funding rate is. But just in terms of matching all the
rates for the marginal production and market extensions versus regular markets, I don't think you would find much
difference there.
I think another thing, Jared, that I think is kind of important, when you go to the Greenwich data in our -across our
whole footprint, all in, roughly 80% of our clients view us to be their lead bank. And so I'm only making that point
to say it is the same in these market extensions. Our relationship managers are moving their clients and those
clients are switching their lead bank from somewhere else to us. So, anyway, I would say that the marginal
13


Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
production would be similar. Of course, the growth rate is higher, but at least, as it relates to pricing, I would say
it'd be similar to the marginal production even in legacy markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
To just give you a little fact, we keep up with new account pricing on the deposit side obviously. New accounts
came in at about 390 basis points in the second quarter, and that's all level, every new account that went over the
deposit system. And that's about 10 to 15 basis points higher than what was in the first quarter. So, it wasn't a
significant kind of uptick for new accounts. Appreciate the deposit book behaves a lot differently than the loan
book. The deposit book has a lot more kind of fluidity in it. So, you've got old accounts that are also repricing, but
the new accounts that we had to attract to our balance sheet came in at 390 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. That's great color. Thanks. And then, when we look at the CRE book and you're letting that slowly rundown
with payoffs. Once you hit your target of the 225% capital, do you expect to continue to see that go lower from
there or, at that point, you would reevaluate the appetite and we could expect to see growth in loans to maintain
that 225%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. No, I think the simple answer really to your question is we would expect to reengage and target the
allocation at 225%. Our belief about that is that asset class will continue to be a really important asset class for
our firm. We just felt like it needed to be a smaller allocation in terms of what it meant to our risk-based capital. It
felt like that was appropriate, both because of the economic conditions and just because of how we desire to run
our balance sheet going forward. We desire not to have an outsized concentration in CRE for all the reasons that
you know and understand. But, yeah, we haven't done [indiscernible] (00:43:50). All the people are still here. We
have clients that continue to be in dialogue with us about subsequent requests, all those kinds of things. And so a
long-winded way to say, yeah, we expect the growth to pick up.

Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So, you mentioned in the deck that this fixed rate lending has been challenged by the rate environment. So, could
you give us some context as far as how you're trying to navigate that? And also how does that inform how you
think about loan yields going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. The second quarter, we were down at 7.08% on the fixed rate originations, but they were only about 15%.
So, I think what I need to do is reengage with the market leaders and figure out what's going on. I'm sure there is
great pressure from the markets, but we still need to I think do better. So, I think it's more about sales emphasis
and getting those yields back up to where they're closer to that call it 7.25%, 7.50%. Our target is 7.50% on the
low side. So, we're going to continue to hang that out there for our relationship managers to see that. That's
where we want to get. We get it sometimes, but more times than not, like the averages indicate, we don't. But
we're going to keep applying pressure there and try to achieve that.
The spreads on floating and SOFR-based credit, their handles are higher and that's part of time because we
believe a lot of borrowers are opting to go to that channel, as have a lot of our fixed rate loans. They've moved
into floating and SOFR-based because they believe the rate decreases are coming and they're going to try to take
advantage of that. So, what we try to do in Treasury is make sure we manage that effectively so that we don't get
out of whack from a balance sheet perceptive and quite heavily we feel really good about where we are.
Did I get to your question, Brandon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That answers it. And then in regards to the shift from the negotiated deposits to indexed
deposits, is that move complete or are you planning to do more of that in the coming quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think it's pretty much done. We kind of hit where we thought our thresholds are at least for that. Obviously,
there's a lot of larger clients that moved in that direction. We were pleased that the overall deals and the quality of
the book didn't go up a lot as a result of that. And so anytime you engage with a client about their deposit rates,
you're always going to be faced with what is impacting more. But we were really pleased that our relationship
managers held that in check when they did.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Maybe just following up on some of the margin outlook. Just maybe first on the security deals. I know you
mentioned, Harold, that most of this bond restructure happened in the back half of the quarter, but you still saw a
pretty big increase in your bond yields this quarter. And so just trying to think about if you can give us kind of an
indication of where you think maybe bond yields will maybe start third quarter once this is all put together?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think we all see an increase in bond yields. That will be part of the increase in the margin going forward.
The first quarter bond yields were down. We had some cash that were sitting in some investments that were
under-yielding. So, we believe we'll see this uptick going in the second quarter – third quarter, I'm sorry, Cath.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. So, it's fair to say, I mean, [indiscernible] (00:48:13) bond yields, one, it calculates the impact of the
bond restructure but the $1.5 billion at 3% better spread but then add in – there was also an increase in just kind
of core bond yields in the second quarter, like more relative to what we saw in the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think that's an accurate assumption.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, great. And then on loan yields, is it fair to also think that, with the $2 billion repricing, maybe you get a little
bit of a better fixed rate new origination levels and then maybe a little bit better growth in that second half of the
year that we could see a higher kind of per-quarter increase in loan yields in the back half of the year than what
we saw in the first half of the year?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Our research would indicate we fully expect to see fixed rate loan yields in the third and fourth quarter to
increase on renewals and originations from what we experienced in the second quarter. We ought to get closer to
those targets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then maybe just one more off of the margin. On BHG, you mentioned that you probably won't
see another securitization until the first quarter of next year. And so what do you think BHG's preference is for
placements? Do you think you'll see more kind of auction movement or more of this one-on-one, negotiate
transactions with PE firms?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. For lack of a better word, they've got orders from various firms for loan volumes that are pretty much a
BHG's option as to when. So, talking to BHG, they will manage their production – they'll manage their placements
between the auction platform and these large institutional buyers to try to make sure that they get – could they get
gain-on-sale treatment with the auction platform. That's what they're going to try to manage to. So, you'll probably
see more loans going to the auction platform here in 2024 than what happened in 2023.

kind of the linked-quarter decline and then the bidding fires and the funding network that unique buyer kind of
declined in the quarter as well. Is that any indication for broader demand for the product or is there something
else going on there as to why placements may be slowed quarter-on-quarter?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Yeah. First of all, I think the market on the origination side has – like we're talking about, these originations are
going to be fairly consistent for the rest of the year, which I think are down from two or three or four years ago,
and that's all because of where the interest rate cycle is and timing of the credit bonds. So, obviously if they
loosened up on the credit bonds or if the interest rate cycle began to turn down, their production numbers would
go up. The demand for their product on the bank side and on the institutional buyer side is as strong as it's ever
been. They could probably sell 2x loans into their networks. But it's making sure that the loans that come into the
firm are consistent with their credit underwriting. So, that's where I guess there might be a limitation as far as
growth rate.
Does that make sense, Timur?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yes, that's helpful. Thanks for that. Maybe switching over to margin and a nuanced question just on your
guidance. So, the current guidance is for margin up in 3Q. The previous year-on-year guide for margin is it's flat to
slightly up. Does the current guidance kind of supersede that or, year-on-year margin, are you still expecting that
flat to slightly up for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think it will be flat to slightly up. I'll have to go back and revisit that assertion, but I think it will be flat to slightly up
for the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just last for me, maybe revisiting Brett's first question on incentive. If I remember correctly, I think,
on the fourth quarter call, there was some comment made that in order to hit 100% of incentives earnings would
need to grow year-on-year. Is that still the right way to think about it? If earnings don't grow, the incentive rate
should be somewhere lower than 100%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Generally, what we do is we'll put targets at a certain level that we believe is fair to everybody. And I think
for this year, full target payout was around, call it, somewhere in that neighborhood, I'll say it that way.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
No, I don't think there's – as far as the absolute cost to interest expense, I don't think you'll see a big increase at
all. I think our relationship managers were able to negotiate that pricing within a pretty thin call it range between
the negotiated price and what they're paying today. But that is contributing to where that interest rate risk
sensitivity table is – net neutrality that where we are today is probably as – we're probably as neutral as we've
ever been.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Yeah. And that's the biggest – that was the biggest quarter-over-quarter shift there. Was that a transition?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A

Yes. Yeah. That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Okay. Great. And then just kind of thinking about the CRE concentration and the guide, the 225% and
such. I mean, it's a lot lower than maybe stated regulatory concern level. So, I'm wondering – and I know, Terry,
you commented on this one already, but is there any part of this that create or is intended to create optionality if
an M&A opportunity ever were to occur? Because, to me, like the last time you guys really got elevated was when
you bought BNC in. And so I'm just wondering if starting at this low level in any way could increase this optionality
to be able to buy something that might be more concentrated?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think, just on the underlying assumption, Steve, on M&A, I don't think we're spending any time and energy
trying to figure out how to acquire a bank. I think the case is that our ability to attract people and loan books
business is so dramatically good. It's just hard to figure out why you would want to acquire something. So, I guess
said simply I don't think that's a motive at all.
The motivation I think, there are two motivations for taking it down. I think one is we have had a belief that the
market was sort of peaking and it was probably a time to have less capital allocated to it just in terms of general
risk management. But, equally important, in terms of the profile from an investor perspective, it was our desire to
get off the screens for people that are highly concentrated in CRE. As I said a little bit ago, man, that's an
important asset class to us and we're going to always be in that business, but we just felt like it would be wiser to
get more to the middle of the pack in terms of what the level of concentration was just, as you know, a lot of
people were screening for CRE concentrations and we just rather be in the middle of the pack.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Yeah. I'll answer it this way. We didn't disclose the portfolio primarily around privacy issues. It's a fairly narrow
band of loans. It's a meaningful amount. It's a meaningful amount of our credit. So, privacy concerns are why we
didn't want to talk more about what portfolio it was and so on and so forth. But what we did want to talk about was
that we've enhanced our control structure, and those enhancements are meaningful. That means they're
expensive and they're all going to be able to get that re-characterization, I'll say it that way. But we've elected not
to do that. But there will be future opportunities in that portfolio to continue to do this with new credit.
I apologize for not being able to tell you more about it, Russell, but that business line is pretty important to us and
it's a pretty sensitive kind of group of people, I'll put it that way.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Zachary Westerlind Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Just a quick one for me on the deposit front. You guys have been able to keep noninterest-bearing
deposits flat pretty much since year-end. Just kind of curious how that fits into your overall deposit guide? Is there
any point where you guys are starting to think that you can win back those noninterest-bearing deposits? Any
color you can give there would be helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Zach, it's a great question. Yeah, our guide would include consistent performance in our noninterest-
bearing volumes. Right now, we believe we're hopefully at the bottom and we'll be able to grow noninterest-
bearing from here. We've had quite a bit, call it, 15% of our new account growth is noninterest-bearing. So, there
are new accounts coming in. And we're hopeful that a lot of that new account growth, even though it's at 15%,
that that seed money put into noninterest-bearing will grow over time. So, call us optimistic, but we believe we'll
see that number perhaps expand. But, right now, our planning assumption is that it's going to be fairly consistent
for the rest of the year.

Hey. Just a couple of small ones for me. Just the tax rate, Harold, going forward, what's – I know you mentioned
something in the release, but just as far as how we should think about that going forward, more of that lens.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, we believe the capital optimization, bond repositioning, all of that, that we'll go back to kind of a more
consistent tax rate going forward than we have probably in the first quarter, fourth quarter, that kind of thing. So,
we feel like we'll be back at those levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. So, like a 4Q level. Okay. And then just on the fee income, was there anything kind of non-sustainable in
the run rate when you look at this quarter without focusing on the individual line? I mean, it felt pretty good. It was
strong across the board. But anything unusual in there that might not be sustainable as you look going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
No, I don't really think so. I think there's two areas – well, there's one area and that's in these evaluation of some
of these unconsolidated investments that we have. But I don't think there was anything unusual there. So, we
didn't feel like we need to call out anything this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Last quarter, we had that mortgage servicing, right, as income. And so that's why the decrease in that line item.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Right. Understood. Okay. And then just the last two is maybe on the loan growth, for Terry. Just the optimism on
the loan growth in the second half versus first half, any – I mean, the key driver of that, Terry, I guess, what would
you point to there just given you seem a lot more optimistic than the first half?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I think it just has to do with what the pipelines look like. As you would guess and as all the numbers have
indicated for a number of quarters, the principal provider of the growth is new hires. So, as we continue to hire
people, they continue to move books. And, Brian, you know how that work. We make some people move and
hoping that they – some it takes them up to a quarter or two or whatever to get it done, but it just feels like, as I
say, in pipeline discussions that we're in a stronger position today than we would have been 90 days ago.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. Make sense. And then just the last one on the margin. I guess given the repositioning, I guess if
you think about the margin in the back half of the year, it would seem that this third quarter margin expansion is
greater than the fourth quarter margin given the full quarter impact. So, just kind of want to confirm that and just
22

kind of the puts and takes there and then just remind us the impact of – in a down rate environment, the sensitivity
of the balance sheet and how that would perform?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think from a margin perspective, we're just pretty tight on whether or not there's any rate decreases or
increases from here. We obviously don't think there's any more rate increases. But we should see continued
margin positive news there going into third quarter and again in the fourth quarter, particularly if we can hold on
this noninterest-bearing deposit assumption and we can get repricing on these fixed rate loans and hold our
spreads on all this new – all the new loan volume.
I just want to re-emphasize because I don't know if we've got this out very much about these relationship
managers that we've hired over the last couple of years. We've got a lot of them out there, and they're all in these
new markets or a lot of them are in these new markets. So, we have reason to be optimistic that we'll see this
loan growth pick up here in the second half.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. And then just the thought of the margin, Harold, the linked-quarter change in 3Q versus 4Q, would that
comment make sense as far as the pickup you could see in 3Q being greater than the 4Q, just given a full quarter
impact of the optimization? Is that's the right way to look at that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, there will be some – there's some money and cash at the end of the second quarter from the optimization
that will get reinvested in the third quarter in some maybe some higher-yielding assets. So, it could happen. I don't
know if it'll be a meaningful amount of uptick or not, but it could help.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. All right. That's all I had. Thanks for taking the question, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, Brian.
