Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, we reported earnings of $211 million, an
increase of 87% over the second quarter. Our customers continue to act prudently, conserving cash and adjusting
their operations, driving a reduction in loans and taking deposits to a new record. Lower loan balances along with
strong credit metrics and an improving, yet uncertain economic path resulted in the allowance for credit losses
remaining near 2% and a provision of $5 million.
As far as revenue, the impact from lower interest rates waned. Card fees remained robust and other fee income
categories began to recover. Expenses are well-controlled and included a $4 million increase in charitable
contributions. ROE returned to double digits at nearly 11%, and our book value per share grew to $53.78, the
seventh consecutive quarterly increase. We remain focused on continuing to enhance shareholder value.
Based on recent conversations I've had with employees and customers, sentiment appears to be modestly better,
reflecting cautious optimism and a sense of hope for the future based on our country's overall economic
resiliency. We've begun to see some signs of improving conditions. However, it is very difficult to predict the pace
of the recovery. This is reflected in our loan portfolio where, overall, we are starting to see some positive trends.
Balances began to grow in mid-quarter and increased modestly month-over-month in September. Also, our
pipeline has begun to rebuild, although it remains well below pre-COVID levels.
On a full quarter average basis, loans decreased $1.5 billion in the third quarter. The largest contributor was a
$910 million drop in average National Dealer loan in conjunction with significant decline in dealer inventory levels
in the second quarter, which have yet to recover. This is due to supply backlog following the manufacturing
shutdown, combined with a rebound in sales activity. We anticipate loans will rebound next year as auto inventory
returns to normal levels.
Deposits continue to show strong broad-based growth, with average balances increasing $4.5 billion, including
$3.2 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits. Government stimulus programs have provided tremendous liquidity. In
addition, as we've seen in other times of economic uncertainty, our relationship-based customers are maintaining
and building cash in the safety of their Comerica accounts. The resulting increase in liquidity drove our total
average assets to a record $84.3 billion.
As expected, net interest income declined $13 million as lower interest rates had a $15 million impact. In this
ultralow-rate environment, we continue to carefully manage loan and deposit pricing to attract and maintain
customer relationships.
Comerica has a strong credit culture with conservative credit underwriting, which has served us well in times of
economic stress. During the current period of unprecedented disruption, our portfolio has performed well, and we
believe this will continue to be a differentiator for us in the industry. Criticized loans remained stable and
nonperforming assets were well below historic norms. Also, net charge-offs decreased only 26 basis points.
However, given the difficulty in predicting the path of economic recovery, our credit reserve remains at over $1
billion.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
We are staying close to our customers in addressing their needs. At the current level, we believe our reserves are
appropriate and that we are well-positioned. Noninterest income increased as customer activity began to rebound,
including continued strong contribution from our card platform. Of note, following robust activity in the second
quarter, derivative income declined $10 billion.
We have continued to maintain our expense discipline. Excluding the impact of deferred comp and an increase in
charitable contributions, expenses declined. Our capital remains strong with an estimated CET1 of 10.3%. We
remain focused on deploying our capital to support growth, while maintaining our very attractive competitive
dividend.
And now I'll turn the call over to Jim to review the quarter in more detail.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 4, average loans decreased $1.5 billion, which
compares favorably to results for the industry, as indicated by the H8 data for large banks. As Curt mentioned,
National Dealer declined $910 million due to low inventory levels, impacting floor plan loans.
As far as Corporate Banking, you may recall that large companies drew on lines earlier this year to build liquidity
buffers in a time of great uncertainty. This resulted in an increase of nearly $800 million in second quarter average
balances. Corporate Banking line utilization has returned to pre-pandemic levels, with average balances down
nearly $500 million in the third quarter.
General Middle Market loans declined about $400 million, while deposits increased nearly $2 billion. Customers
have been prudently cutting costs as well as reducing working capital and CapEx requirements to improve their
cash flow in this challenging environment. For the portfolio as a whole, line utilization decreased to 47% at period-
end.
On the other hand, with full quarter effect of PPP, loans grew in Business Banking and the Small Business
segment captured in Retail Banking. Also, our Mortgage Banker business, which serves mortgage companies,
was at an all-time high, increasing over $300 million due to very robust refi and home sale activity.
Loan yields were 3.13%, a decrease of 13 basis points from the second quarter. Lower rates were the major
driver. One-month LIBOR, the rate we're most sensitive to, declined 19 basis points. This was partly offset by
pricing actions we are taking, particularly adding LIBOR floors when possible as loans renew. A mix shift in
balances including the full quarter impact of lower yielding PPP loans also had a negative impact on yields.
Deposits increased 7%, or $4.5 billion, to a new record of $68.8 billion, as shown on slide 5. The larger driver
continues to be noninterest-bearing deposits and growth has been broad-based with increases in nearly every
business line. As Curt mentioned, customers are conserving and maintaining excess cash balances.
Period-end deposits increased over $700 million. The largest contributor was technology and life sciences, as
robust fundraising added liquidity and customers reduced cash burn. With strong deposit growth, our loan-to-
deposit ratio decreased to 76%. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 17 basis points, a decrease of
9 basis points from the second quarter. Our prudent management of relationship pricing in this low rate
environment, our large proportion of noninterest-bearing deposits, as well as the floating rate nature of our
wholesale funding, drove our total funding cost to only 14 basis points for the quarter.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
As you can see on slide 6, we've put some of our excess liquidity to work by increasing the size of the portfolio.
We added $1.75 billion in Treasuries and $500 million in mortgage-backed securities. In addition, we continue to
reinvest prepays, which remained elevated at around $1 billion for the quarter. Yields on recent purchases have
been around 140 basis points. The additional securities, combined with lower rates on the replacement of
prepays, resulted in the yield on the portfolio declining to 2.13%. Of note, we've not seen a significant impact on
the portfolio striation or the unamortized premium, which remains relatively small.
Turning to slide 7, net interest income declined $13 million to $458 million and the net interest margin was 2.33%,
a decline of 17 basis points relative to the second quarter. The major factors were lower rates, which had a
negative impact of $15 million, or 7 basis points on the margin, and the increase in excess liquidity reduced the
margin by 9 basis points.
Taking a look at the details, interest income on loans declined $26 million and reduced the margin 13 basis
points. Lower interest rates on loans alone had an impact of $21 million and 11 basis points on the margin. Lower
balances had a $14 million impact and the mix shift in portfolio, including the full quarter of lower yielding PPP
loans, had a 4 basis point impact on the margin. Partly offsetting this were higher loan fees in the margin,
primarily PPP-related, as well as one additional day in the quarter.
As discussed in the previous slide, we had lower yields and higher balances in our securities portfolio, which
together had a $2 million and 2 basis point negative impact. Higher deposits with the Fed added $1 million, but
had a negative impact of 9 basis points on the margin. Deposit cost declined by $5 million and added 3 basis
points to the margin, primarily a result of our prudent management of deposit pricing, as I previously mentioned.
Finally, with reduction in balances and lower rates, wholesale funding costs declined by $9 million, adding 4 basis
points to the margin. We received the full quarter benefit of debt repayments we made in the second quarter and
we prepaid $750 million in FHLB advances in July and August. As a reminder, given the nature of our portfolio,
our loans were priced very quickly, so the bulk of the impact from lower rates has now been absorbed. Also, we
continue to closely monitor the competitive environment and our liquidity position as we manage deposit pricing.
Overall, credit quality was strong, as shown on slide 8. Net charge-offs were $33 million, or 26 basis points,
including recoveries of $20 million. Criticized loans remained relatively stable, with an increase of only $27 million
and comprised 6.5% of the total portfolio. Nonperforming loans remained low at 62 basis points and the bulk of
the $54 million increase in the third quarter was attributed to Energy loans.
In summary, we are leveraging our experience and expertise, working closely with our customers, and carefully
reviewing their current and projected financial performance. We have adjusted risk ratings as appropriate. We
started this cycle from a position of strength with very low nonperforming and criticized loans, and migration so far
has been manageable.
Turning to slide 9, the economy began to improve through the quarter. However, the path to full recovery remains
uncertain due to the unprecedented impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. For this reason, our CECL modeling in
the third quarter did not significantly change and included the recession that we have been experiencing followed
by a slow recovery. More severe assumptions were used to inform the qualitative adjustments made for certain
segments.
This, combined with a reduction in loan balances, resulted in a slight decrease in our allowance for credit losses,
which remains above $1 billion. Our credit reserve ratio was 2.14% excluding PPP loans. Our credit reserve
5

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
coverage for NPLs was strong at 3.2 times. Again, we are well-positioned with a relatively high credit reserve and
low nonperforming assets, as illustrated. We believe our disciplined underwriting in diverse portfolio are assisting
us in managing through this pandemic recession.
Energy loans are outlined on slide 10. They decreased $251 million to $1.8 billion at quarter end and represent
3.5% of our total loans. E&P loans make up nearly 80% of the Energy portfolio; and Energy Services, which is
considered the riskiest segment, was only $46 million. The allocation of reserves to Energy loans remained above
10% .While nonaccrual loans increased, criticized loans decreased $102 million and net charge-offs decreased to
$9 million. Charge-offs were net of $14 million in recoveries, which are unlikely to repeat in the near term.
Fall determinations are just beginning and we expect a small increase in the borrowing basis, as higher energy
prices were offset by lower production inventory. With more than 40 years of serving this industry, we have deep
expertise and remain focused on working with our Energy customers as they navigate the cycle.
Slide 11 provides detail on segments that we believe pose higher risk in the current environment. Note, we
continue to review the portfolio of refining our assessment. As a result, we have removed casinos and sports
franchises from this group as we no longer see elevated risk. That aside, period-end loans in the social distancing
segment decreased $145 million, or 5%. As expected, criticized loans increased a $102 million, yet remain
manageable at 10% of the segment and nonaccruals remain very low. We believe we're well-reserved as we have
applied a more severe economic forecast to the segment.
We have deep expertise and a long history of working in the cyclical automotive sector. Production has been
ramping back up and auto sales have rebounded. Similar to the social distancing segment, while loans decreased
about $250 million, the criticized portion increased, yet nonaccruals decreased and remain low.
Our leveraged loans tend to be with Middle Market relationship-based customers with sponsors, management
teams, and industries we know well, and we avoid the covenant-light deals. Balances increased to $85 million and
criticized and nonaccrual loans were slightly higher. As far as payment deferrals, they provided a cushion as
customers adjusted to the environment. Now that they've acclimated, initial deferrals have expired and new
requests have been nominal. Total deferrals at September 30 dropped to only 70 basis points of total loans.
Noninterest income increased $5 million, as outlined on slide 12. Improved economic conditions had a positive
impact on deposit service charges and card fees. Deposit service charges were up $5 million with increased cash
management activity. Also, card fees remained very strong and increased $3 million due to higher consumer
volumes and merchant activity spurred by the economic stimulus, as well as changes in customer behavior
related to COVID.
Commercial lending fees grew with increased syndication activity in unutilized line fees. As expected, customer
derivative income declined following very robust activity in the second quarter, which related to the rapid decline
in interest rates and volatile energy prices that have since stabilized. Derivative income also included a $6 million
unfavorable credit valuation adjustment compared to an unfavorable adjustment of $3 million in the second
quarter.
Securities trading income decreased $2 million, but remained at an elevated level and reflects fair market
adjustments for investments we hold related to our technology and life sciences business. Similarly, investment
banking fees declined, yet continue to be relatively strong. Deferred comp asset returns were $8 million, a $6
million increase from last quarter, which is offset in noninterest expenses. Also bank-owned life insurance
increased with the receipt of the annual dividend.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
Turning to expenses on slide 13, salaries and benefits increased $8 million. This included the increase in deferred
comp of $6 million that I just mentioned, as well as seasonally higher staff insurance. A catch-up on maintenance
projects, which we expect to continue in the fourth quarter, as well as seasonal taxes, resulted in an increase in
occupancy costs.
As previously announced, we increased our charitable contributions to assist businesses and communities
impacted by the pandemic. Since early-March, Comerica, together with Comerica Charitable Foundation, has
distributed over $9 million to over 150 nonprofit and other community service organizations.
Outside processing decreased $4 million, primarily related to lower PPP loan initiation volumes. In addition,
operational losses and legal-related costs declined $3 million. Our expense discipline is well-ingrained in our
company and is assisting us in navigating this low rate environment as we invest for the future.
Our capital levels remained strong, increasing to an estimated CET1 of 10.26%, as shown on slide 14. We remain
focused on maintaining our attractive dividend and deploying our capital to drive growth, while we maintain strong
capital levels with a CET1 target of 10%. In addition, the dividend is supported by a strong holding company cash.
Slide 15 provides our outlook for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. We are assuming a continued
gradual improvement in GDP and unemployment. Also, while we do expect to see some modest forgiveness of
PPP loans by the end of the year, there is a great deal of uncertainty. Therefore, we exclude any impact from
forgiveness on loans, net interest income, and expenses from this outlook.
Starting with loans, we expect National Dealer balances to increase as auto inventory levels begin to rebuild.
Mortgage Banker is expected to decline somewhat from its record high with seasonally lower purchase and refi
volumes. In addition, we believe the recent stabilization of balances that we've seen in certain business lines,
such as Middle Market, Large Corporate, and Energy, should continue. However, on a quarter-over-quarter basis,
average balances in these businesses are expected to be lower.
We expect average deposits to remain strong and stable as customers continue to carefully manage their
liquidity. This expectation excludes the benefit from any further government stimulus programs. Overall, net
interest income is expected to be relatively stable. As we have already absorbed the bulk of the effect from the
decline in rates, we estimate the net effect of lower rates alone will be $5 million or less.
The impact from reduced loan balances, lower interest rates on loans, and lower yields on securities is expected
to be mostly offset by additional rate floors on loans, a decrease in deposit rates to an average of 14 basis points,
as well as the full quarter benefit of third quarter actions to increase our securities portfolio and reduce wholesale
borrowings. Again, this outlook excludes any benefit from PPP loan forgiveness.
Credit quality is expected to be solid, with net charge-offs increasing from the low third quarter level, which did
include strong recoveries. Although the pace of the economic recovery remains uncertain, with our credit reserve
at about 2% of loans in the third quarter, we believe we are well-positioned to manage through it.
We expect noninterest income to decline, as we do not expect the third quarter levels of deferred comp, securities
trading income, or BOLI to repeat. We believe several customer-driven fee categories should grow with improving
economic conditions, but this is expected to be offset by card volume decreasing as recent elevated activity
recedes.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
As far as expenses, we expect a rise in technology costs as we catch up on initiatives that were delayed due to
COVID. We are committed to investing in our futures that we are well-positioned coming out of the pandemic. In
addition, we expect an increase related to seasonal staff insurance. Mostly offsetting these increases, charitable
giving should revert to a normal level and we do not expect the level of deferred comp to repeat. We continue to
focus on controlling expenses as we closely manage discretionary spending. Finally, our capital levels are healthy
and we remain focused on managing our capital with the goal of providing an attractive return to our
shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call back to Curt.

I will close with slide 16. Over our 170-year history, Comerica has successfully managed through many
challenging times. Using our experience and expertise to help our customers and communities navigate stressful
situations and achieve long-term success is at the heart of Comerica's relationship banking strategy.
The unwavering dedication of our team to assist our customers, as well as support each other and our
communities continues to be a source of pride. Our longstanding corporate mission is to attain balanced growth
and profitability by providing a higher level of banking. Fundamental to our success in accomplishing this mission
is our key strengths which are outlined here.
We have long-tenured employees who have deep expertise in the industries they serve. We have a strong
presence in the major metropolitan areas of Texas, California, and Michigan, and these markets provide
significant growth opportunities along with customer diversity. There are abundant collaboration opportunities
among our three divisions: Commercial Banking, Retail Banking, and Wealth Management.
Our robust leading edge cash management suite continues to evolve to meet the everchanging needs of our
customers. We have a strong credit culture. Our consistent, conservative underwriting approach and prudent
customer selection resulted in superior credit performance through the last recession. It is also assisting us in
weathering the current environment, as evidenced by our strong credit metrics this quarter. We are committed to
maintaining our expense discipline while investing for the future.
Finally, our capital position is strong and our first priority is to use it to support growth, while providing an attractive
return to our shareholders.
Now, we'd be happy to take questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush
Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Peter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Good morning. You guys called out net interest income to roughly stabilize in the fourth
quarter. Do you think we're at the bottom for net interest income, especially with rates really can't go much lower
and you've got such a high percentage of the loans tied to one-month LIBOR?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning, Peter. Yeah, we are pretty much at the low, given the balance sheet mix that we have right
now. So, the $5 million or less that I mentioned for the fourth quarter should continue, kind of, in the short to
medium term. I do expect to see a little bit of balance sheet shift movement or mix movement as we move into the
second half of 2021 and beyond as some of our fixed rate assets start to turn over, that would be some of the
Treasury securities, as well as the hedges that we have in the appendix of the presentation here. But I would view
the $5 million or less as kind of our base level of great impact for the foreseeable future, pending any maturity of
some of the fixed rate assets as they turn over in the future.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. And then just on the loan growth, it's challenging for you guys, challenging for the industry. Curt, in your
prepared remarks, you said you're starting to see some positive trends. I'm just wondering if you can talk about
some of the trends you're seeing and a little bit of color on the auto floor plan into next year and maybe Middle
Market and Small Business?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Peter. This is a Peter Sefzik. So, the positive trend that we would see, you start to look at things like the
pipeline starts to include more new-to-new opportunities than just new-to-existing. The activity level of our
relationship managers has just picked up a little bit. Across all of our different geographies, you certainly feel more
activity than you did 90 days ago, but it is not at all near pre-COVID levels. So, I would just say that our overall
observations of what we're seeing with customers and prospects is improving, but I can't say it's robust.
You asked about dealer and floor plan. This has been a challenging year for that business, but there are some
good indicators. The SAAR rate is sort of double what it was back in April right now on an annualized basis. So,
we're encouraged by that. What Jim and Curt described, what we typically see in the fourth quarter is a little bit of
lift. From a year ago, we saw a drop in the fourth quarter. But I think this year, we'll kind of see our typical pattern
that we have seen in dealer. So, we're encouraged by that and we think that'll continue into 2021.

Middle Market and Small Business, again, a little bit of two different stories. I think the Middle Market space is
maybe a little more active than what you would see in Small Business that has been more hit through this COVID
crisis. But both of those segments are conserving cash and managing their loans and being really, really
responsible. And I think that's translated to the nice credit performance that we have seen so far.
And again, depending on the geography and what's going on with COVID sort of defines how active each of those
segments is at the moment. But we are encouraged by what we're seeing in both of them, probably more in
Middle Market than maybe in Business Banking and Small Business just yet. But that would be how I'd answer
that.

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great, thanks. Good morning. Just actually want to kind of follow-on Peter's question a little bit. You mentioned
that the NII is going to, let's say, be relatively stable for the foreseeable future. But I think a lot of the market
concern or question is what happens a little bit longer. And you mentioned the Treasury securities and the hedges
are going to drive sort of balance sheet mix, I suppose, in the back half of 2021. How much does those hedges
and other items actually add to NII today that will be going away in the future? Like, where does NII bottom out if
rates actually stay where they are when we think about, like, late 2021 or maybe 2022?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Okay. Good morning, Ken. To box it in for you, we talk about the $5 million of rate impact kind of in the short to
medium term. As you did some of that Treasury churn and you did some of the hedges rolling off, I would expect
the rate impact to start edging up a little bit, but I don't see it going past the $15 million that we saw in the third
quarter. So you can kind of box it in using that range.

Ultimately, if you go to the total hedge portfolio that we have, you can do the math yourself. You see it adds up to
about $100 million annually, but those go out a number of years. And obviously, there's a number of things that
could happen in the economy and a lot of uncertainty in terms of where rates might go over the next few years.
But the way I would frame it up for you is $5 million in the short to medium term, and then this thing starts to churn
through, we'll hover somewhere between $5 million and $15 million for a couple years after that. But I don't see us
really getting to the $15 million number that we saw in the third quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And sorry, just to be clear. When you say $5 million or $15 million, are you talking like a $5 million
reduction per quarter? Is that what you mean?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
That's right. That's right. $5 million or less.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got – okay. So, over the next say one year if it's $5 million per quarter, then it's $20 million for the year,
something on a run rate basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
That's right. $20 million or less taking that math.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. I understand. And then, sorry, my follow-up question. On slide 10, you've talked about your Energy
portfolio, which you guys always do and we appreciate. But do you actually believe that there's outsized risk in
Energy lending today versus some of the other at-risk categories that you highlight?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Ken, this is Melinda. I mean, clearly, the Energy portfolio is where we have seen the most stress really over
the last 18 months. I would say that kind of given the current environment and where oil and gas are today, that
has certainly helped stabilize our credit deterioration. But in order for this segment to really start to improve, prices
are going to need to strengthen.
I expect that we'll continue to see some lumpiness and additional charge-offs in the Energy line of business. If you
look at where our nonaccruals are, they are still concentrated in our Energy book and the nonaccrual levels for
the other at-risk portfolios are very, very minimal at this point. That's not to say that we won't see some additional
migration in some of those other at-risk categories. But for now, I think our biggest risk probably continues to be in
the Energy line of business.

Hey, good morning. Good morning, everybody. So just to start on the provision, which was very modest this
quarter, if loan balances remain under pressure, which you're guiding to in the fourth quarter, and the economic
model doesn't change much, right, if oil prices remain steady, should we expect another quarter of very modest
provision in the fourth quarter, like similar to this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. As it relates to the CECL reserve, I mean, obviously, you all know that's a highly complex process that we
go through each quarter and look at a lot of the variables that you already mentioned, kind of the economic
forecast, the level of the portfolio, and how our portfolio is responding. As the economy begins to recover, even
though we'll see losses occurring, reserve levels theoretically should start to come down. That's how CECL is
designed to work.
Predicting exactly when that would occur, whether we would need to add to reserves or release, is going to really
materialize over the next couple of quarters. We would expect that we'll continue to see some additional migration
over the next two to three quarters, including into nonaccruals and some resulting charge-offs from that. And
assuming no other negative changes to the macroeconomic outlook, reserve levels, again, should begin to
normalize.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And how did the change in economic forecast impact this quarter's reserve?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
It was more – it was probably an equal weighting between the economic forecast being stable. Again, Q2 versus
Q3 we used consensus; as well as, remember, our portfolio declined about $1.5 billion, so that obviously had an
impact. And then, we added qualitative reserves to those at-risk portfolios to make sure that we had adequate
12

(CMA) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
coverage for those at-risk portfolios, which again we do expect to continue to see some migration and some
losses, but we believe that it's going to be very manageable and well-covered with our $1 billion of reserves.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then finally, for Curt. So I think the guidance for 4Q 2020, it looks like pre-tax pre-
provision income growth will remain a bit of a headwind. From a big picture view, assuming short-term rates
remain anchored near zero, could you talk about your ability or maybe even a game plan to drive pre-tax pre-
provision income growth over the next year? Any new fee income initiatives, expense initiatives? Anything you
can talk about there? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Steve, obviously, we are very focused on the return to our shareholders and delivering appropriate growth
on ROE. And, obviously, despite some of the current challenges, we do feel good about our long-term financial
outlook and we continue to think we have a very attractive franchise, that we operate in some great higher growth
markets, which, we believe, as we start to come out of the COVID situation now, the recovery, that those markets
should perform better than many areas of the country.
In addition, I think that we've got a number of comparative strengths that we will continue to leverage. Credit is
certainly one of those areas and I think will be in focus for the remainder of 2021 and maybe beyond that. And we
believe that based on our historical performance there, we can perform very well there relative to our peer group.
You mentioned fee income, it's an area we're very focused on. And most notably, I might mention Treasury
management continues to be an area of distinction for us and it continues to be an area that we're investing in
and adding additional capabilities. I think you know we've got a very strong card and merchant platform. We
continue to feel like we've got upside opportunity there. And then, we've got really broad wealth management
expertise and talent, and we're very focused on the intersection between our Wealth Management business, the
Commercial Bank, and our Retail Bank in terms of driving new revenue.
Then just on the balance sheet side, Peter talked a little bit about what we're seeing there. But we continue to
have a lot of depth in Middle Market and Business Banking, as well as a number of unique niche businesses that
we think position us well versus the competitors, especially as we come out of this situation. And the only sort of
niche business we have that maybe has some downward pressure on it would be Energy.
And then, we're going to stay focused on expenses from a long-term perspective, and we'll continue to look at
opportunities that we might have to be careful on the expense side. Obviously, did a really good job coming out of
our GEAR Up initiative and have run a very efficient organization relative to our peer group. And having said all
that, what we're not going to do is sort of sacrifice the long-term view.
And my perspective, and I said this on our last earnings call, is that when you look at our company, 170 – now
171 years old, we've managed through lots of different cycles, lots of different economic challenges. And so, we
remain focused on the long term and the quality of our assets, our overall long-term earnings power and investing
in the franchise longer term, and we're going to focus on the things that we can manage in what is a very
challenging environment.
I do think there's, obviously, a lot of uncertainty, both with COVID and, more recently, the election coming up. So
there's a lot that's unpredictable, but we think we're well-positioned to sort of manage whatever direction the
13

economy may go in. And, again, focusing on the long term and doing that at the same time and fixing how we can
improve revenue in 2021.

Hello, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rahul Patil Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Hey. This is Rahul Patil on behalf of John. So, I just had one question on NIM. Could you talk about some of the
opportunities you have on the funding cost to mitigate some of the NIM pressure amid this low-rate environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning. That's something we are looking at and considering taking action on. We're not ready to
declare that quite yet. We, obviously, let some more expensive funding mature in June and did some prepays
both in the second quarter and the third quarter. What we have left now really consists of a lot of parent company
funding, which, of course, we're not going to prepay, because we value the cash that we have at the parent
company. We have some sub debt, which provides capital value. So, we're not going to prepay that.
We're really down to a very limited amount of bank senior debt, which provides some pretty good FDIC benefit.
And, frankly, the economics aren't great if you went through a tender process. So that pretty much leaves some
FHLB funding, of which we've really left the most efficient form of. We're paying in the very low 20-bp range. It'd
be difficult to obtain that level of funding again in terms of its efficiency. So, we're considering doing something,
but we're not quite ready to do that yet. And so, I'd say there's some limited opportunity that we may or may not
be pulling the trigger on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rahul Patil Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. And then just shifting to a different topic. In your outlook, I think you mentioned expenses tied to technology
catch-up. Could you just give us a sense for where you stand in terms of the tech spend which you consider as
absolutely necessary versus something that can wait? And then maybe what sort of incremental spend are you
planning for over the next year or so in terms of tech?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. This is Curt. I'll take that question. What I would say on the frontend is that we did a lot of work through
GEAR Up to position our spend, and really try to migrate the spend less around legacy platform and more around
things that we would consider customer- and colleague-enabling. So we went through a lot of process around
14


Comerica, Inc.
(CMA) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
rationalizing a lot of our aging platforms and applications. We've done a lot to migrate applications to the cloud
and just overall free up capacity.
So we've got a lot of things in flight right now. We continue to work on loan origination capabilities, especially
online lending capabilities. We've rolled out a companywide CRM platform and have continued to make
enhancements there. We're continuing to invest in our data analytics capabilities and how we use predictive
analytics in the sales process and serving our customers. We've got a new digital online platform for originating
new customer relationships, especially in the Retail Bank, which is proving valuable to us in acquiring new
relationships. And we've talked about Treasury management earlier, and the list kind of goes on.
And what I would say is that when you look at sort of our spend today, we definitely have freed up a lot of capacity
for colleague- and customer-enabling type capabilities. And we believe that we are staying very abreast of sort of
where the industry is headed and increasingly are seeing more digital adoption of technologies across all of our
platforms, not just the Retail Bank, but Wealth Management and Commercial Banking as well.

Good morning, Erika.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. A couple follow-up questions on the NII line of questioning. First, you continue to carry a
significant level of cash relative to history, and I'm wondering as we think about your guidance that you talked
about $5 million base impact on quarterly net interest income that perhaps widens to a higher number that's less
than $15 million due to the impact of fixed rate repricing and the hedges rolling off. What does that contemplate in
terms of cash redeployment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Erika. As we mentioned, we did deploy the $2.25 billion throughout the third quarter into some
Treasuries and MBS securities. At this point in time, we are not contemplating in that outlook that we gave
additional actions in terms of either purchased funds prepayment or securities investment, growth of the securities
portfolio. Now, both of those are possibilities but, as I mentioned, the funding we have is pretty efficient. And, of
course, as you know, the yields out there aren't especially enticing for redeploying cash in the securities.
We were willing to do a certain amount of that in the third quarter, given some of the uncertainties that were there,
as well as our own asset sensitivity position, and we could consider doing it in the future, too. But given some of
the marginal benefit that's available, at this point, we're not contemplating that and that is not baked into that
outlook.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And consensus, I'm looking at 4Q 2021 just because I'm thinking that could be a clean number for
consensus, excluding PPP paydowns. And right now the consensus has net interest income of $451 million for
the fourth quarter of 2021 and a net interest margin of 2.38%. If we're interpreting your comments right, unless we
get much better loan growth and a much better opportunity for cash redeployment, that seems like that has to be
readjusted lower for now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Well, we'll see. We're not ready to comment on 2021 yet. Keep in mind, I did say $5 million or less. So, I mean, it
could be a little more than zero, could be a little less than $5 million, but it's going to be in the low single-digit of
millions. And then, loan volume will be a key, obviously. That's a big driver and that's a bit of a wildcard.
And then finally, floors, which are a part of that rate outlook, we haven't have some success with, as you can see
in one of the slides, and that could be a driver also to help mitigate some of those pressures. So, not quite ready
to comment on 2021 yet, but we do see some opportunity to mitigate some of these headwinds.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just one last one and maybe this is for Curt. There's been a lot of discussion on what normalized
returns could be for banks. And as I think about the recovery loan growth rates at Comerica following the financial
crisis, robust 2012 through 2015, and much lower growth into 2016 through 2018, and then up 3% in 2019. As we
think about what Comerica can earn sort of in a post-COVID world, do you see that the growth opportunity for this
bank is really more of a GDP plus? That seems like a softball question, but the historical averages would suggest
that it might be lower than that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Erika, what I think maybe to keep in perspective is, historically, we have grown more in-line with GDP. And
I do think growth in-line on a relative basis with GDP makes sense, but also recognize that every market we
operate in has a little bit different dynamics and maybe being impacted differently by either a recession or a
recovery. And then, we've got some national businesses that can swing those numbers from time-to-time based
on dynamics that are in play, whether it's Mortgage Banker, Commercial Real Estate, Dealer, Energy, etcetera.
What I do think is important to remember during that period of time between 2015 and 2018 is that we essentially
managed down close to $2 billion of Energy outstandings, and that was very deliberate on our part. That was a
very deliberate strategy to bring our exposure down from a number that was in the high single digits down to
where it is today. And we are comfortable with the portfolio based on the size it is today. But we were de-risking
our portfolio and trying to de-risk some of the volatility in the portfolio.
And so, we were managing that down significantly. And so while we were seeing growth in the rest of the core
portfolio, it was really being masked by that impact there. But we do believe we've got a lot of growth opportunity.
We have been actively redeploying some of our FTE to some of our higher growth businesses and some of our
higher growth geographies. And we also are seeing some disruption right now with some of our other competitors.
And so, we've added some outside talent to the organization as well along the way.
16

And we are keenly focused on new customer acquisition right now; not only serving our existing customers, but
acquiring new customers in many of our business lines and many of our geographies. So I think your statement is
an accurate one, and I do believe that the 2015 to 2018 was a little bit of a aberration based on some unique
circumstances that we were managing through.

Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Scott.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Hey, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to return to the loan growth discussion for
a quick second. I think early in your prepared remarks you guys had said that loans grew modestly quarter-over-
quarter for the first time in September. What specifically was that? Was that like is National Dealer finally sort of
catching up or where did that net growth come from?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Scott, this is Peter. So, I think it's a little bit of moving parts in there. And if you look at that slide 4, the
conversation that we've talked a little bit about with what we've seen in Dealer and what we think this transition
into Q4 is, as you described, a little bit of stabilization in Dealer. We do continue to see paydowns in the Large
Corporate space. We've seen some nice activity in our Equity Fund Services business. And we think we've kind of
maybe seen 47% utilization, I think, is about as low of utilization as we've really ever seen in a really, really long
time.
And so, our belief is that that's kind of bottomed out, if you will. I don't know that I would say it's on any sort of
upward trajectory. Mortgage, clearly, had a really good September, a good third quarter overall, and our period
end balances in mortgage for September were high. So, I don't know that I would take away from that that we are
on some sort of uptick going into Q4. The outlook we've described is what we think we'll see. But we do feel like
the end of the quarter was a little better than what we were seeing in the beginning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, perfect. That's good color, Peter, and I appreciate that. And then, I think you began to touch on what my
thought was going to be, which was on that line utilization number on slide 4, the 47%. So, it sounds like, if I'm
interpreting it correctly, you guys think that is kind of bottom. So, is that sort of an accurate interpretation? And is
that indeed still above pre-COVID levels? Because one or two other banks have actually seen utilization dip
below pre-COVID levels. Just wanted to get a sense for your thoughts there.

James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. This is Jim. Pre-COVID, of course, we were a little bit higher than 47%. So, clearly, the 47% reflects
some of the lack of loan demand in this kind of COVID environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Scott. And I – again, that 47%, depending on what line of business and what geography you're talking, it
actually is less in some and higher in others. So, my hope would be that we're kind of reaching the bottom or have
reached the bottom. But, to Jim's point, pre-COVID levels for us, I think, would be higher in utilization than what
you've got here.

Good morning, Ken.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. A question on capital return. So, I guess, the good news with the low
provision is that the earnings coverage of the dividend is looking better as we look out. You guys aren't stress
tested. But just wondering how you think about the potential of getting back into buyback activity and how much
you have to evaluate where the dividend is in terms of its size and payout at the point you get ready to or
potentially get back into buybacks. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Okay. Well, good morning, Ken. Yeah, as you've heard in past calls, we continue to be confident about the
dividend and I don't anticipate a change there at this point in time.
Regarding buyback, I like to say that we're cautiously confident in terms of what we can see in front of us. We're
not quite ready to turn the buyback on just yet, because there's always the thought of what can't we see in front of
us. There's still a lot of uncertainties in this environment and we would like for there to be just a little more
certainty in terms of the risks out there before we turn that buyback back on.
18


Comerica, Inc.
(CMA) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
But I also mentioned that some of the uncertainty isn't all negative. Some of it is potentially positive in the form of
risk-weighted asset growth or loan growth. We've had a decrease in loans, as you know, ex-PPP for a few
quarters here. And to the extent the economy bounces back and we get some loan growth, that could eat into
some of that capital, too, and we prize that capital and value it for providing capital to fund customer loan growth
also. So we just want to get a little bit more certainty in the environment before we declare the buyback turned
back on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
And, Jim, just to add, I mean, our first objective is always to take care of our customers, and so we would, first
and foremost, like to deploy capital into assets in terms of the lending side. But to the degree that doesn't happen,
we will continue to evaluate buyback.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Understood. And a follow-up on the PPP side, understanding that your guidance doesn't bake in any forgiveness.
Can you tell us just generally how you are expecting and thinking about forgiveness to play through in terms of
timeframe? And whether or not you've made any changes to the fee schedule, given the change between two-
year and five-year average durations? Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. There's a lot of uncertainty, obviously, with the forgiveness process, so we're not ready to make any
predictions there yet, which is why we excluded it from the outlook. We have not made any changes in terms of
we handle the fee amortization. So we're still on a two-year basis and comfortable with where we're at from an
accounting standpoint on there, and we'll just continue to monitor the environment and see where it goes. We're
prepared to go, though, if and when Congress and the Treasury are ready to go.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Have customers – do you have an idea of how many customers have already applied for forgiveness, just to give
us a sense of like whether or not to expect it to be active or not? Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. This is Melinda. Let me just talk for a minute about our forgiveness process. We are actually starting our
open invitation to clients starting today, and we'll do that on a tiered basis. We did pilot our technology platform for
the forgiveness, so we've accepted about 60 applications. As you know, the SBA was pretty slow to get their
portal open and actually processing forgiveness applications. So, invitations will start going out today, and that will
be tiered based on loan size and we would expect to see those applications start coming in over the next 30 to 60
days.
It's difficult to predict what the volume would be, but we're going to concentrate on the larger customers first,
because we are still hopeful, quite frankly, that we get additional relief for the smallest borrowers in terms of
simplifying the application. We did get simplification on $50,000. It was helpful, but not as helpful as we had
hoped. And we're still hopeful that we will get forgiveness simplification for the loans less than $150,000. And so,
those will tend to be more at the back half of the processing over the next quarter or so.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Within National Dealer Services, do you expect a more pronounced step-up
here in the fourth quarter relative to what you saw in, say, 2016, 2017, and 2018, where, just eyeballing slide 23, it
looks like there was typically a $300 million increase in average balances?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Terry, it's Peter. Yeah. So, I think what I would say is that when you look at that slide 23, I would compare 2016,
2017, and 2018, where you saw an uptick, to what we think we're going to see this quarter versus a year ago,
where we saw the drop-off in 2019. That, historically, you would have seen that business uptick in the fourth
quarter. I don't know that it will be $300 million like you described in 2016. We do think it'll be up. But we don't –
we think a year ago is not what we're going to see where we saw a drop-off of $200 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then just as a follow-up question. Maybe the Mortgage Banker Finance book with period end loans
$4.5 billion and given the average in the third quarter, is your view today that on an average basis Mortgage
Banker Finance is still higher in the fourth quarter, and that really in the first quarter of next year is when you see
the headwinds?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Terry, the answer to that is, no, we don't think so. We think it's actually going to drop-off here. If you kind of look at
page 21, the MBA originations forecast is down. We think it will be sort of down to flat – flat to down as we go into
the fourth quarter and really continue into 2021, a lot along the lines of the forecast you see on the bottom right of
page 21.
