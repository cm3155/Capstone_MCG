MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Hello and welcome to Citi's second quarter 2022 Fixed Income investor review with Chief Financial
Officer Mark Mason and Treasurer, Michael Verdeschi. Today's call will be hosted by Peter Demoise, Head of
Fixed Income and ESG Investor Relations.
We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be
given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded
today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
Mr. Demoise, you may begin.

Analyst, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is
available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based
on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual
results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our
SEC filings.
With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will cover a number of topics. First, I'll briefly
discuss our second quarter 2022 operating results, which we feel good about, especially given the operating
environment. Second, I will cover recent balance sheet trends, including our robust liquidity and capital position.
Third, I will share some thoughts on what our issuance activity might look like over the near-term, and then Mark
and I would be happy to take your questions.
But before I discuss the highlights of the quarter in more detail, I do want to spend a moment reflecting on the
current macro and geopolitical environment which remains complex and uncertain.
US consumer and corporate balance sheets remain healthy, but the risk of a recession, particularly abroad, has
increased. That said, we feel very good about our balance sheet with strong capital, liquidity, and ample reserves,
all of which position us well to weather any number of economic scenarios, continue to serve our clients, and
execute on the strategy we laid out at Investor Day.
With that, let's turn our attention to Citi's operating results. Slide 3 covers some of the highlights from the quarter.
We executed on our strategy, with revenues up 11% year over year, which benefited from higher rates and
continued strong client engagement, especially across markets and services. We increased deposits, maintained
robust liquidity, and grew our capital base, positioning us well to meet our increased SCB and G-SIB
requirements in the coming quarters, which I'll talk more about in a moment.

Slide 4 outlines our second quarter results in more detail. In the second quarter, we reported net income of $4.5
billion and an RoTCE of 11.2% on $19.6 billion of revenue. Net income was up sequentially on strong growth in
net interest income, but down year over year largely driven by the absence of a large ACL release in the prior
year period.
On slide 5, we show key capital and liquidity metrics and our average balance sheet. We saw both advanced and
standardized risk-weighted assets come down, both year over year and sequentially, as we continue to optimize
RWA. We ended the quarter with a standardized CET1 ratio of approximately 11.9%, which is approximately 50
basis points higher than the first quarter and about 140 basis points above our current regulatory requirement of
10.5%.
Going forward, we expect our regulatory requirement to increase to 11.5% in October 2022 to account for the
increase in our stress capital buffer. In January 2023, our regulatory requirement will increase to 12% as a result
of an increase in our G-SIB surcharge. The combination of earnings generation, closing of divestitures, and
continued RWA optimization will be important tools as we manage toward this higher CET1 requirement.
On the bottom left, you can see that we continue to maintain strong liquidity levels, with $531 billion of average
high-quality liquid assets, or 22% of Citi's average total assets supporting a healthy LCR.
Total assets increased 2% year over year on higher trading-related assets, reflecting a continuation of strong
client engagement.
Slide 6 presents trends in our loan portfolio over the past five quarters. Total average Citigroup loans decreased
2% year over year, as growth in PBWM and ICG was more than offset by a decline in legacy franchises. In
PBWM, average loans increased 4% year over year, largely driven by growth in branded cards and retail
services. In ICG, average loans increased 3% year over year, largely driven by growth in trade finance. And as
expected, legacy franchise loans continued to decline, largely driven by the reclassification of loans to held-for-
sale.
Turning to slide 7, we show trends in average deposits over the past five quarters. Total average Citigroup
deposits were relatively flat year over year, as growth in PBWM and ICG was offset by declines in legacy
franchises and Corp/Other. In PBWM, average deposits increased 6% year over year, driven by growth across
retail and wealth. In ICG, average deposits increased 1% year over year, driven by the deepening of existing
client relationships and new client acquisitions. And despite the industry pressure from quantitative tightening,
we've remained very focused on growing operating deposits and expect modest deposit growth for the full year.
On slide 8, we provide an update of our LCR metric and drivers. Our average LCR remained relatively stable at
115%.
Now, let me cover our parent benchmark debt issuance program on slide 9. So far this year, we have issued
roughly $20 billion. And we were pleased to issue an affordable housing bond, and we continue to diversify the
syndicate group and our debt issuance across underrepresented groups. Going forward, we'll continue to
maintain the flexibility to issue a mix of tenors, currencies, and structures as we prudently manage the liquidity
profile of the firm and support our clients.
On slide 10, we show the composition of our long-term debt outstanding. Our total long-term debt on an end-of-
period basis decreased by approximately $8 billion to roughly $257 billion. This decrease reflects the optimization
of funding in the bank as we continue to maintain robust deposit levels.

On slide 11, let me cover our issuance, maturity, and redemption expectations. As you can see in the middle of
the slide, we have issued $20 billion of benchmark debt so far this year. At this point, we estimate that we could
potentially issue up to an additional $10 billion over the second half of this year, depending on how our needs and
opportunities evolve. So this would translate into approximately $20 billion to $30 billion of issuance for the full
year 2022.
Moving to our last slide, let me summarize several key points. The franchise continues to perform well through
this period of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. We remain committed to the strategy outlined at
Investor Day and are seeing it play out in our results.
We earned over $4.5 billion of net income in the second quarter. We maintain a strong capital position with a
standardized CET1 capital ratio of 11.9%, an SLR of 5.6%, and a surplus above our TLAC requirement. We also
maintain a strong liquidity position, with an average LCR of 115%, over $960 billion of available liquidity
resources, and we are comfortably in compliance with the NSFR rule, which became effective last year.
Before we move on to Q&A, let me touch briefly on LIBOR. As you may know, federal legislation was signed into
law earlier this year that provides a solution for legacy LIBOR instruments. Importantly, we expect the legislation
to apply to all of Citi's outstanding US-dollar LIBOR-based securities without appropriate fallbacks. We are
obviously pleased with the industry solution that this outcome provides, and look forward to seeing the final rule.
And with that, Mark and I will be happy to answer your questions. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Scott Cavanagh with APG. Your
line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Cavanagh Q
Analyst, APG Asset Management US, Inc.
Good morning, guys, and thanks once again for the call. A couple of questions for you. First of all on the funding
guidance, could you just walk us through the potential uptick of $10 billion for the remainder of the year? And then
I've got another question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. Good morning, Scott. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll just start with how we were thinking about the first
half, and then I'll address your question about the up to $10 billion of issuance.
For the first half, there were a number of factors. We've had an evolving macro backdrop with quite a bit of
volatility in the markets, and with market conditions being uncertain and our needs evolving, we aim to issue more
than we had originally planned. And in addition, on the back of that volatility came good client engagement. So
really, the first half was about a combination of need, but also being opportunistic in accessing markets in the first
half.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jul-2022
When I think about the second half, a lot of those same items are on our minds. So, when I think about the
ongoing volatility, we're leaving ourselves the flexibility to meet our needs but also to continue to be opportunistic.
I mentioned that client engagement aspect. That will remain an important driver in what our needs are and how
they play out over the course of the year.
But also in addition, when I look out at 2023, we do have another $10 billion maturing in that year. So, really it's
about leaving ourselves flexibility, I would say, in an evolving and certainly uncertain market environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Cavanagh Q
Analyst, APG Asset Management US, Inc.
Thanks for the color. Then just switching gears over here to credit card, could you guys give us your thoughts on
the pending bill that was – the Wall Street Journal article and the Bloomberg article noted today and yesterday?
And then on asset quality for credit card, could you just walk us what you're seeing globally and then domestically
what you're seeing in between retail and branded?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Let me kind of start and just in terms of the overall performance that we've seen, particularly in the cards portfolio.
We've been very pleased with the progress that we've made in the quarter there. As you know, we've been
investing particularly in marketing and acquisitions across both the branded cards and retail services portfolio,
and we've seen that play out in good new acquisition momentum. We saw average interest-earning balances play
out through the quarter, particularly on the branded cards side, and so we're starting to see that loan growth that
drives top line momentum a bit earlier than I've talked about in the past. So in the second quarter, and we expect
that to continue in the back half of the year.
As we look at the underlying performance, particularly in this environment where there is a fair amount of
uncertainty for all the reasons mentioned before, we're not seeing any particular concerns around the credit
quality in the cards portfolios. The losses, if you look at our loss rates, remain very low and probably half the
levels of what I would have talked about would be in a – what we would see in a normal part of the cycle – so
continued good performance there.
When I look at – through the portfolio across FICO scores and the like – no particular areas of concern. For new
acquisitions, maybe a little bit of an uptick in terms of slight delinquencies in the new acquisitions with the low
FICO scores, but nothing abnormal or that would raise alarm there.
And then even when I look at the activity, purchase sales remains very strong through both portfolios, and
payment rates remain quite strong as well. And so, as I think about that, I feel very good about the performance
there and about the ability to manage the risk.
And the first part of your question again? Scott?

Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, we're still obviously looking through that and working through that as a management team, so I don't have
any additional color to provide on that at this point in time. We've obviously seen what's out there in terms of
credit card networks and merchant fees and the like, and we'll continue to kind of work with partners to assess
that.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Peter Troisi with Barclays. Your
line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Troisi Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi, good morning, just another question on funding. Just wondering how actively you're using the ABS market for
overall funding needs? And maybe if you can give us a sense for how much of the benchmark issuance that you
show on the slides last year and in the first half, related to ABS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Hi, Peter. Good morning. We've not been active in that market. In fact, over the past year, we've allowed that to
run down to some degree. And I think that's been a broader theme with our bank funding levers. Obviously, we've
seen, and the industry has seen, good deposit growth over recent years, and so that really has meant that we've
brought down a lot of that bank funding lever.
So – but that being said – as we think about quantitative tightening and how that is already underway and the
pace picking up later this year, depending on how our balance sheet evolves, obviously we still expect as we've
talked about modest deposit growth, but you could see us begin to leg in and normalize our overall funding profile.
Obviously, much and most really coming from deposits, but of course, taking advantage of some of that low-cost
funding that may come in some of those bank levers, things like FHLB or even in the asset-backed space that you
mentioned.
But in this past year, no, we've not utilized that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Troisi Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, thanks for that. And the FHLB funding and the ABS you just walked through, is that contemplated in the
zero to $10 billion of potentially incremental issuance for the rest of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Again, that $10 billion is really meant to provide us flexibility, and again, we'll see how our balance sheet needs
evolve in addition to remaining opportunistic. So, yes, that could apply to both the parent benchmark as well as
opportunities that we may see in the bank.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jul-2022
Jesse Rosenthal Q
Analyst, CreditSights, Inc.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for the call, as always. I've got a quick question on the preferreds. So, you have
about $3.5 billion coming callable over the next year. I think they're all floating-rate LIBOR. There's a couple with
pretty hefty back ends. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about potential refinance opportunities in this type
of market, and basically, is there more of a willingness on the part of the issuer to extend, even if the coupons
resetting are fairly high, just based on where the forward curve is showing and not wanting to lock in a new non-
call-five at relatively high rates? And any color on how you're thinking about the prefs in this market would be
helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, Jesse. So, we've talked about this in the past, how we think about press and the upcoming
calls. And I don't think our thinking has really evolved on this from the perspective of as these calls are coming
due, we're going to be looking at that call date and looking in the medium-term as well and evaluating our need for
that capital.
And then, of course, if we do in fact need that capital, we're going to look at the economics associated with
leaving that security outstanding versus calling it and replacing it in the marketplace. And you asked a question
about the fixed rate. Really, yes, that would be a factor of course. We're going to be looking at the credit
component as well, spreads, and so we will look at that overall economic trade-off between calling it versus
leaving it outstanding.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Robert Smalley with UBS. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi, good morning, and thanks for doing the call. I have two topics. First, following up on some of the financing
questions, could we step back for a second and do – or could you give us some bottom-up type of color on how
you came to the up to $10 billion number? What specifically will this be funding? Where do you see some
variances there? What informed you to come to the $10 billion number, specifically piece-by-piece? That's the first
part of my question.
And also, were there any other impacts – deposit data impacts or impacts from security portfolios switching from
AFS to held-to-maturity – that reduced any available liquidity? That's my first question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Hi, there. So, let me start with that last part of that question. And so, when we think about the securities portfolio
and the use of AFS versus HTM, that is really a focus on ensuring that we're optimizing that securities portfolio
and being mindful of the OCI at-risk. And I'll remind you, that AFS portfolio, the valuation changes does impact
that CET1. And so, changes in that valuation of AFS does impact that CET1 ratio and can cause volatility.
Obviously, the selection in HTM is meant to minimize that volatility.
But importantly, these are very – the vast majority is going to be Treasuries and Agency MBS. Those are very
liquid securities, and so we retain the option, of course, to finance those and access the repo markets. So, it
8


Citigroup, Inc.
(C) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jul-2022
doesn't really change our funding profile, in that you can still access those markets. Now, keep in mind that these
securities predominantly are held in the bank where we have an enormous amount of deposit funding. But again,
that is not a driver of how we think about the issuance.
Just getting to that $10 billion number, again, when I think about what we issued in that first half, $20 billion, and
as I mentioned as I think about providing flexibility, 2023 we have $10 billion maturing, and again, that becomes
one consideration. But also, we want the flexibility to be opportunistic. And look, we're going to have to see how
our balance sheet evolves and how our client engagement evolves.
So I would say there wasn't any precise breakdown of that number, other than us providing ourselves flexibility.
We're trying to do our best to give you some sense in terms of the guidance. But again, it's hard to that with any
level of precision, especially in an environment that is evolving and has certainly a high amount of volatility in the
market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
I think your last point, Mike, is particularly key. This is an uncertain evolving environment. We've got a very strong
balance sheet that we feel very good about. We want to make sure that we maintain flexibility to support our
clients as their needs evolve, and to maintain that strength in the balance sheet that we have today. And so we're
being completely transparent with how we're thinking about it, and we'll continue to do that in the coming quarters,
and you'll see the actions that we take accordingly inside of this range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, that helps. And then as a follow-up, and maybe it's more of the same question, but when I look at the SLR,
you're comfortable at 5.6%. Do you see gross balance sheet growth decreasing, increasing, or staying the same
through the rest of this year and into next year, or can we even tell at this point? And I know you answered a
question on prefs earlier, but if we see that number start to drift down to 5.3%, will we see some preferred
issuance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
I think over the remainder of the year, as we've talked about, we would still expect to see modest deposit growth.
We're still looking at spending in cards as well as loan growth more generally, so we would expect the balance
sheet to continue to grow.
But in terms of that leverage, again, we're comfortable where we are. We don't think that growth is really going to
pressure that leverage ratio. That being said, if we did need to, we would come to the market for that, but that
really hasn't been a factor for us. It hasn't been binding. But to answer your question, we are expecting that
balance sheet to grow.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Consistent with our client demands, consistent with the strategy we talked about at Investor Day that over time
delivers improved returns, which is what we're here to do.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jul-2022
Kevin James Maloney Q
Analyst, BlackRock Advisors LLC
Thanks for taking my question. Mike, on deposits, you mentioned that you expect them to grow moderately for the
rest of the year, and clearly, they were down from 1Q modestly. And just thinking about where you think that
growth is going to come from, TTS business is clearly market-driven, but if you could give us any color, that would
be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
So, Kevin, again, our thoughts are on the full year basis probably that you do see that growth. Look, I think there's
a number of things. Obviously, our strategy in the businesses that we're operating in, that we believe that the
relationship-based nature of those activities mean that, especially as you see a quantitative tightening unfolding,
that perhaps those deposits that are less relationship-driven are the areas that could be impacted by that
quantitative tightening. But again, just given our strategy and the relationship-based nature of those deposits,
really do factor into our thinking about how those deposits will evolve over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
If you think about our ICG business, right, where we talk a lot about our TTS franchise, the multinational clients,
the middle market commercial clients that we're serving there, that is about their operating accounts, and
continuing to work with them to bring them the breadth of the franchise while growing the deposits that represent
their operating account activity is part of where we expect to see continued momentum.
If you think about the PBWM business where we've talked about the importance of wealth, we've talked about the
importance of small business activity, the nature of those high-end consumers that we're covering, again, by
bringing on new advisors, by bringing on new accounts into that wealth business, we expect to see continued
momentum there. So while quantitative tightening will certainly come with some pressure, as we look through the
portfolio with the quality deposits that we're looking to grow, we expect to see continued growth come through.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin James Maloney Q
Analyst, BlackRock Advisors LLC
Great, thank you. As a follow-up question, on page 16, you had a nice table dictating or suggesting the net
interest income walk for the second half of this year. And just – well, I'm wondering how you think you're going to
– well, this is actually last year, but how do you think it's going to grow in the forthcoming second half of this year?
Is it really driven by rates or driven by market growth, meaning balance sheet growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
So again, I'll start that and, Mike, feel free to chime in. So what we look to do here, and I mentioned it on the
earnings call, was to really give a little bit of guidance as to the total revenue that we've been talking about since
Investor Day, but to break that down for the investor community into NII guidance. And so here I've tried to put or
we tried to put what the first half looked like juxtaposed against the prior year, and then specifically speak to what
we were expecting in the second half, excluding markets, given how hard it is to forecast markets and certainly a
breakout of markets.
That's going to be a combination of both the interest rate environment that we are managing through and
continuing to see rate hikes play through there, and some of the volume growth that we've seen over the course
10

of the year already continuing to contribute in the back half of the year. And as you heard me mention earlier, in
parts of the business like cards, for example, where we started to see some of that average interest-earning
balance growth come to play in the second quarter – we still expect that to play out in the back half of the year as
well. And so, factors like that will be important contributors to the NII growth of the $1.8 billion that I mentioned
here.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Arnold Kakuda with Bloomberg Intelligence. Your line is
now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arnold Shoichi Kakuda Q
Analyst, Bloomberg LP (Research)
Thanks, guys. I think you guys have won Q2 earnings this period. What really helped is strength in trading,
particularly fixed income. But is it fair to say that kind of that strength in fixed income and trading, that may be part
of the factor in terms of why maybe issuance might need to pick up again in the second half of the year? Trading
continuing to be positive in a volatile environment, but that's heavily funded with debt. So is that – if we can hone
in kind of on this $10 billion of potential actual issuance – could you say that could be a reason why you kind of
upped, potentially upped the guidance range on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, so look, it's really any number of factors when we think about that client engagement. And certainly, what
we issued out of the parent, that's going to be in our nonbank activities as we thought about it. So, certainly some
of that nonbank funding, there's multiple sources. There's going to be, of course, repo financing. One of the
complements to our funding profile in the nonbank are the client notes as well, but of course, we'll issue our
benchmark there, too.
So that volatility, of course, this environment has played well through the capabilities in our markets business.
And we'll just have to see how the second half plays out and how our funding needs evolve and how we best
optimize that funding profile to meet those needs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arnold Shoichi Kakuda Q
Analyst, Bloomberg LP (Research)
Okay, great. Thanks, that's helpful. Switching gear to CET1 levels and your targets, obviously next few quarters
higher CET1 requirements, 150 basis points and all on SCB and G-SIB, and that's what's caused you to raise
your target to 13%.
It was interesting to see that you – I could see that kind of all rolling back in the midterm. So, is it fair to say that
kind of the planned asset sales or exits over the next, I guess, one to two, three years, that's going to help you
kind of get the balance sheet – kind of get that down a little bit and focus more on wealth management, more
steady revenues – those things could help impact your G-SIB and SEB let's say by 2024, 2025? Is that fair to
say?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Look, I think there are a number of factors. So obviously in the quarter, we built up our CET1 from the prior
quarter to the 11.9%. You're right, we do have some headwinds in the way of the SCB and the G-SIB score, and
frankly, I think the industry saw those headwinds as well play out with some of the results from DFAST.
11

Q2 2022 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jul-2022
As we think about our business, there are a couple of things that I think allow for us to build up to that and then
contribute to what we think OF as a medium-term level. So the buildup obviously would include the earnings
generation that we expect to continue to see play out in the balance of the year and going forward. Obviously, the
DTA and utilization of that is an important contributor. You're absolutely right, the divestitures, which we've started
to see benefits from even in this prior quarter with the closing of the Australia deal. are important contributors to
that as well.
The AOCI that pulls back to par is an important factor. So, there are a number of factors that allow for us to build
up. and then as you rightfully pointed out, at our Investor Day, we talked about a strategy that over time, shifts the
mix of our portfolio and the mix of what contributes to our earnings profile to a more steady, predictable earnings
stream. And that becomes an important factor as you think about what goes into the DFAST analysis and
establishing a more durable PPNR, and therefore, an improved SCB over time.
So, a number of factors build up to that. The divestiture is certainly one important factor in terms of the leveling-off
over time both in the way of SCB but also in the way of G-SIB score to some extent.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Brian Monteleone with Vanguard. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Monteleone Q
Analyst, The Vanguard Group, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Mark, on the earnings call when you were talking about transformation, you mentioned the
continued build-out of infrastructure to enhance your stress testing capabilities. Can you go into some more detail
about kind of where you are on that, the additional capabilities that will be available and kind of what's still left to
do?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. So, look, as you would imagine, the transformation includes a range of investments across our operations,
some in finance, some certainly in risk and risk management and controls, et cetera, et cetera. And what I was
referencing was around how we've been improving our stress testing capabilities, really across the firm.
And if you take, for example, if you take a look at kind of counterparty credit risk and stress testing around that,
that's one area where we've made investments into the platform that allows for us to run multiple stress shocks
against the 3 million-plus derivative trades that we have and all of the securities financing products that we have,
to allow for us to see how a shock might impact the valuation or the revaluation of those exposures and positions
that we have.
And so, this – the capability in the system allows for us to look at up to 4,000 risk factors and to run these
scenarios on a daily basis – again, positioning us and the entire management team to understand what the impact
could be and ensure that we're appropriately managing and starving off some of that risk as necessary.
So, that's just one example of counterparty credit risk that we've – and one platform tied to that that we've been
investing in. And as you would expect in this type of environment, having those types of capabilities is critically
important, right, and so we're very pleased with that progress and know that there's more to come there.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Jul-2022
Brian Monteleone Q
Analyst, The Vanguard Group, Inc.
Great, thanks. And as a follow-up, could you give a little more detail in terms of the RWA optimization that was
done in the quarter? Specific, decisions that came out of it? And then I know you guys have talked about more to
do there, but any kind of guide in terms of order of magnitude of what's left to do?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. And I think it's important that we – that I give some or remind everyone of the context for this a bit, right?
And so, when we talked about again at Investor Day, one of the important elements of how we are managing the
business is how we optimize the balance sheet, and in particular in the case of markets, how we optimize the risk-
weighted assets.
And that is with an eye towards how do we improve the returns of the firm over time and get to those medium-
term targets that we talked about of 11% to 12%? And that involved the ICG at a 14% to 16% and the PBWM
business at a 16% to 18%. And this RWA optimization in markets, as a proxy for returns, we've asked markets to
look at how do you improve your revenue to RWA? So we know a target that we want to get to for returns in that
business, we've translated that into a tool that they can use in order to ensure that we're optimizing, and that is a
revenue-to-RWA metric that they're using.
And they've actually been making very good progress against that, as they look across clients, as they look
across products, and identify opportunities where that metric is lower than what the target is, they're constantly
working through how do we either improve that by getting these clients to do more business with us across the
franchise, or how do we take a decision to exit that particular product with that particular client where there isn't an
opportunity to do that, in order to drive optimization?
So specific examples in the case of markets, in equities, rates, commodities, those are products where we saw
improvement in or optimization of that RWA. And it ranged from everything like requesting more collateral from
clients to considering higher initial margin posting and the like, as well as I mentioned, in some instances deciding
to trade away or somewhere else in depending on how low that metric was and the opportunity we did or did not
see.

David Jiang Q
Analyst, PGIM, Inc.
Hi, guys. Just a question on the RWAs again. I know you called out the RWA optimization from, I guess, from
Australia sale. Do you have – can you give a sense of what that is for all the businesses that you plan to exit – in
terms of what's been allocated there? And I think you mentioned in the earnings call that the numerator impact
from that is $3.5 billion, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, so what – yeah, so I'm just – there are multiple points there. So, one is the RWA optimization I was just
speaking about was really related to markets in particular and how we're kind of managing it broadly. You
rightfully point out that with the exits, those exits contribute to us having more capital and to some extent,

therefore, helping to improve our CET1 ratio and over time affording us that capital that we can return to
shareholders.
What I described on the earnings call was that for the deals that we have in the balance of the year and expect to
close in the balance of the year, or for the total for 2022, we're looking at about $3.5 billion in terms of that capital
impact that we would expect, of which Australia was about roughly $1.4 billion or so that we would have realized
last quarter.
And the mix, when I look at the impact of that for Australia to that CET1 ratio was about 50:50, so 12 basis points,
six of those basis points coming from an RWA capital impact, and the other six of those basis points in the case of
Australia coming from other items including the CTA benefit that flowed through at closing. So roughly a 50:50
impact for Australia.
I haven't given and don't really want to break out what that mix looks like for the balance of the deals that we're
going to close this year. But as I think you've witnessed, we've been very transparent as those closings have
happened, and you can expect for us to continue to do that.
So $3.5 billion for the year, $1.4 billion or so for Australia thus far, the balance comes in in the back half of 2022
for that $3.5 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jiang Q
Analyst, PGIM, Inc.
Got you. Thanks, Mark. The second question I have is on the funding plan, the zero to $10 billion. Is that mostly
driven by kind of the market volatility that we've seen thus far, or is there any part of that that's kind of pre-funding
for next year kind of pulling forward? I'm just trying to break out what caused the additional issuance need.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. Again, and as we've said, it's up to $10 billion, so think of that range as zero to $10 billion, and it's simply a
reflection of giving ourselves flexibility. We're trying to provide some guidance around that, but it could be a
function of volatility. It could just be a function of client needs as well as getting out in front of future issuance. So
this is really us just providing ourselves flexibility.

Hi, thanks again for the call today. I was just curious. There used to be a regulatory landscape update slide in the
past fixed income presentations. And I know a lot of the proposed rules and so forth were fully implemented, but
some of the materials are probably integrated within the slides now, but I'd be curious to get your take, since this
is always a useful industry-type call, of any particular regulatory items that are more in focus or more pending for
the team that is becoming more in depth for a need to consider this year. Thank you.

Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Ryan, first of all, I'm impressed that you recall kind of how the presentations have evolved, so thank you for that.
Look, there are both things that are current and things that are on the come. And I'll start and, Mike, feel free to
add.
But I'd start with just kind of the broad sentiment as to how I think about capital and the regulatory environment
that we're managing through, which is, there has been this sentiment out there that there's about the right amount
of capital for the industry that's out there. And that was a sentiment a couple of years ago, and I still subscribe to
that. And I'm hopeful that as the regulatory environment continues to evolve that that perspective is maintained.
And what that means is that for some of the regulation that's still out there pending, that it is looked at and viewed
in a holistic way. So that is to say, as new things are incorporated, things that might exist today are reconsidered,
so that in aggregate, the amount of capital that banks are required to hold is about the same. And keep in mind
that it's come up over the past couple of years. And so there are certainly things out there, FRTB and so on and
so forth, that are on the come in a couple of years. But that is my perspective, and I'm hopeful that that continues
to be kind of a regulatory perspective around how capital is treated.
Now, we obviously just saw a pretty significant increase in the SCBs across the industry. That's been volatile. I
think that that has to be, frankly, looked at and considered because certainly challenging to manage with that
degree of volatility in a stress capital buffer. We have the G-SIB score that has gone up with the significant
amount of liquidity that's come into the industry over the past couple of years, so G-SIB scores for a number of
banks are expected to increase. There's never really been a recalibration of how we look at balance sheets and
the G-SIB score. I hope that that is considered in the context of, again, that holistic view.
So I'll stop there and, Mike, I don't know if there's anything you want to add or not, but that's certainly some of my
high-level thinking on it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
No, I would just echo that. It's how the whole US regulatory capital framework works together and as it evolves
over time. I think all those measures should be contemplated, whether it's the Basel IV, G-SIB, or even the SLR,
how they work in unison is important.

Hey, good morning. Thank you for the call. Just two questions. The first one maybe on RWA optimization in the
markets. Is that optimization coming apace in the second half of the year or more a 2023 event? And could it lead
to kind of tightening financial conditions for some of your clients? And then a follow-up. Thank you.

Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, sure. So, look, I think optimization – RWA optimization is something that we are – we continually do, right?
So, it's not something that is going to stop in the second half. When we talked about it at Investor Day, we talked
about it in the context of a regular mining of the business, if you will, and looking at it through both the client and
the product lens.
We're obviously building our CET1. We're in our capital building mode, and so that's going to require that we look
across the entire franchise, to make sure that how we're using the balance sheet and how we're using RWA is in
a way that leverages the franchise and what it has to offer to clients, but also allows for us to build to that return
profile that we have. So, I would expect that we will continue to do it in the second half of 2022 and through 2023.
What it does require as it relates to clients, because we are here to serve clients, right, but it does require that
we're working with those clients to ensure that they are, in fact, the core and strategic clients that we are best
positioned to serve. And what that means is that we are able to bring to bear the full breadth of our franchise as
opposed to just one product. And I think that is how clients get the best from us and I think that allows for us to
ensure that we're growing with them and generating the returns that our shareholders expect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Kehoe Q
Analyst, MacKay Shields LLC
Great. Listen, you've been outstanding citizens communicating your issuance needs over the last near decade.
Just wondering now, when you think, like for example, some on the buy side here we feel almost run over in
terms of issuance this year. Is the way to kind of rebuild trust kind of to focus on the issuance in 2023 – you
mentioned $23 billion. Could that number actually increase as QT takes hold and you receive more deposit
outflows, or should we kind of look towards 2023 and go, there's less issuance in 2023 versus 2022? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Mark, what I would say at this point, again, we try to provide some sense of guidance every year. I think at this
point what we're trying to do is give you some sense of how we think about the back end of this year and the
various things that we're contemplating. Again, as I said, client needs evolving but also looking at that 2023.
What we actually do beyond this year will be a function, of course, as we come together as a firm and build our
plans for 2023 and how the balance sheet may evolve at that point. Too early to tell exactly what that guidance
will entail at that point, but as always, it will be a combination of things, looking at the maturities as well as what
the broader needs are based on our client needs.

Jesse Rosenthal Q

Yeah, sorry about that. A quick one for me, following up on the issuance in parent funding question, something
that we've definitely heard a lot of questions on from the fixed-income investor base. But for the one-year pref call
option, how do you guys think about the trade-off between the loss in that final year and what is looking like fairly
cheap funding on the reset spreads, just given where rates have run? And then on top of that, especially in an
16

environment like this, folding in the particular areas of business growth that you're seeing, i.e., those non-bank
lines that demand whole growth financing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Jesse, so you're right. On those calls, TLAC is a big driver of that decision, but no different than anything else that
we may contemplate calling. We are going to look at the overall economics, as you point out. What you
contemplate at that point is simply a source of funding. And so, while you lose that – some of that TLAC benefit –
it is still a funding source, and so, yes, we will look at the need for that funding in that part of the curve and what a
replacement cost may look like. And again, as all things, it will be a function of the interest rate component as well
as the credit spread.
And the question of the interest rate component comes up a lot. When we issue when we think in terms of the
fixed interest rate, we obviously have many different tools that we can utilize to manage our interest rate risk
profile. And it's obviously the asset and liability side of the balance sheet, but it's also use of derivatives. So,
sometimes that interest rate component isn't the key driver. It may, in fact, be the spread because of some of
those other tools that we utilize.
But you're right. It does turn into a cost of funding decision once you begin to lose that TLAC value.
