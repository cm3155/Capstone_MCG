Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Financially, 2019 was a terrific year and was our 10th consecutive year of rising earnings. For the year, we
produced record revenues of $1.1 billion, net income of $499.2 million, and EPS of $4.84. These results were
driven by record organic loan and deposit growth of $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, which generated the
highest total revenues in the company's history against the backdrop of a volatile and falling rate environment.
As our bank has scaled and matured, we also took new capital management actions this year and announced our
inaugural quarterly dividend of $0.25 in Q2 and repurchased 2.8 million shares, reducing our share count by
2.7%. Given all these actions, tangible book value per share grew 20% year-over-year to $26.54 and has now
grown by 237% over the past six years as we continue to expand our business.
We believe shareholder value is deeply correlated to loan, deposit and revenue growth, outstanding asset quality,
and predictable and sustainable earnings. As you can see, Q4 was an extraordinary quarter for Western Alliance
as EPS of $1.25 grew 11% year-over-year and was accompanied by strong asset quality metrics.
Fourth quarter loan growth of $1 billion and deposit growth of $356 million drove our balance sheet to $26.8 billion
in assets. As a reminder, deposit growth is seasonally lower in this quarter, as our warehouse lending clients pay
down taxes from custodial accounts housed with us.
The yearly deposit growth noted above was supported by the best year ever for our HOA business,, they were up
$603 million; tech and innovation, which knocked the ball out of the park with growth of $1.2 billion; and our
deposit initiatives, which saw our balances rise over $100 million.
On the lending side, our regional banking divisions continue their healthy growth trajectory, generating over $550
million growth year-over-year after the reduction of construction, land and development loans of $182 million. Our
residential mortgage program, Warehouse Lending, and Hotel Franchise Finance added $1.561 billion and $451
million, respectively, to the loan portfolio.
During the quarter, we achieved our goal to reduce the relative proportion of our construction, land and
development loans below our 10% target to $9.2% of total loans one year earlier than our December 2020 target.
Of note, captured in the $1 billion of loan growth was a $203 million reduction in CLD.
Beginning in 2018, we undertook a program to mitigate our interest rate risk and support our EPS growth
objectives through the expansion of high quality residential loans originated by our mortgage warehouse clients.
This quarter demonstrated our ability to successfully execute on our strategy to grow revenues through the
transition to a lower rate environment as net interest income for the quarter climbed to $272 million or 8.3% on a
linked quarter annual basis.
Quarterly NIM was 4.39%, only down 2 basis points from Q3 at 4.41%. Full year operating noninterest expenses
grew $62.2 million to $479 million, producing an efficiency ratio of 42.7%. Our operating efficiency ratio increased
from 41.9% in 2018 as net interest income growth was impacted by the three Fed rate reductions. For the fourth
quarter, operating noninterest expenses grew $6.2 million to $128.7 million from the prior quarter, inclusive of
approximately $4.1 million in one-time nonrecurring expenses.
Credit quality remains stable this quarter. Special mention loans dropped $53 million to $180.5 million from Q3.
Substandard loans on an absolute dollar basis are at their lowest point since 2015 when our balance sheet was
only half the size it is today. Charge-offs were $1.2 million in Q4 and full-year charge-offs were 2 basis points of
loans.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Our tangible common equity ratio ended at 10.3% for 2019, compared to 10.1% at Q3, and 10.2% for 2018. For
the year, we returned $171 million to shareholders through our stock repurchase program and dividend
distributions.
Full-year 2019 return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity were 2% and 19.6%,
respectively, compared to 2.05% and 20.6% in 2018. We remain one of the most profitable banks in the industry.
Finally, and most importantly, all of our accomplishments cannot be achieved without the dedication and
professionalism of our management team and the people of Western Alliance. They make the unassailable
difference. Their drive, enthusiasm and standard of excellence is the secret sauce of our company.
Dale will now take you through our financial performance.

Thanks, Ken. For the year, net interest income rose $124.5 million or 13.6% to just over $1 billion. Net income of
$499.2 million increased $63.4 million or 14.5%, and EPS of $4.84 Increased 16.9% from the prior year,
demonstrating the impact of our stock repurchase program.
For the fourth quarter, strong ongoing balance sheet growth resulted in record earnings despite headwinds from a
flattening yield curve that preceded an anticipated Fed rate cuts. Net interest income rose $5.6 million or 8%
annualized from the third quarter to $272 million, driven by a $600 million increase in average earning assets
which outweighed reduced loan yields.
For the corresponding period last year, net interest income rose 11.7%. The provision for credit losses was $4
million for the quarter which was consistent with the prior period. Noninterest income decreased $3.4 million from
the third quarter to $16 million as equity investment income from our Tech & Innovation segment and net gains on
sales of investment securities were elevated in the third quarter.
Noninterest expense was up $3.7 million as data processing, professional fees and incentives and year-end
bonuses increased by $2.9 million, $1.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, which partially offset a $4.7 million
decrease in deposit cost. Compensation costs were affected by increased accruals for annual incentive and
bonus plans.
Share repurchases in Q4 of 88,000 reduced the diluted share count to 102 million, resulting in diluted EPS of
$1.25 for the quarter. Throughout 2019, we reduced shares outstanding by 2.7% by opportunistically
repurchasing 2.8 million shares. For 2020, our board has authorized a new share repurchase plan for up to $250
million.
Turning to net interest drivers. Net interest income for the quarter rose $28.5 million year-over-year to a record
$272 million. Investment yield decreased 12 basis points from the prior quarter to 2.96% due to a flattening yield
curve and lower reinvestment rate. Lower long-term rates increased mortgage prepayment speeds and the
resulting accelerated amortization of premium was responsible for lowering the overall quarterly portfolio yield
from the prior year.
On a linked-quarter basis, loan yields decreased 21 basis points due to reduction in interest rates and spreads
further impacting the decline in yields was our intentional mix shift towards residential loans and the decline in
LIBOR which preceded the cuts in the Fed funds rate and prime.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Interest-bearing deposit costs decreased by 22 basis points in Q4 to 1.08% as a result of proactive steps taken to
reduce our deposit rates immediately after the Fed cut rates in October outpacing the reduction that we had in
loan yields. This decreased funding costs by 12 basis points when all of the company's funding costs are
considered including noninterest-bearing deposits as well as borrowings.
As Ken mentioned, this quarter demonstrated our ability to successfully grow net interest income through the
transition to a lower rate environment. Strong balance sheet growth and proactive steps taken to reduce the cost
of interest-bearing deposits resulted in net interest income growth of 8.3% on a linked-quarter annualized basis.
Despite the strategic shift in our loan mix away from construction and the overall reduction in market rates, the net
interest margin only declined 2 basis points to 4.39% during the quarter as the 12 basis point reduction in earning
asset yield was offset by a 12 basis point decrease in total funding costs.
With regards to our asset sensitivity, our rate risk profile has declined notably as our mix shift to primarily fixed
rate residential loans has reduced our net interest income variability due to changes in the rate environment.
Meanwhile $3.4 billion of our variable rate loans are now behaving as fixed rate, since the rate floors are now in
effect, active. This has reduced our interest rate risk in a 100 basis point parallel shock lower scenario to only
3.8% of expected net interest income at December 31 from 4.8% at September 30, and 7% in June 2018 when
we commenced our residential loan diversification program.
Should rates decline from here, we believe a ramp-down scenario is a much more probable rate reduction
outcome, which further reduces our rate risk profile by another 50%. We believe we are now positioned to
asymmetrically benefit if rates rise, but have limited downside net interest income risk if rates should fall. With an
additional 25 basis point rate cut, another $1.7 billion of loans with floors will be triggered which will further reduce
sensitivity and mitigate our margin compression.
Our interest rate mitigation program has lowered our volatility if rates decline further while maintaining significant
upside if rates rise again. To be clear, in a ramp scenario, if rates decline 100 basis points, 1.7% of net interest
income is at risk. However, if rates go up 100 basis points, we would have a positive 3.6% impact to net interest
income, double the effect in a down-rate scenario.
Turning now to operating efficiency, in Q4, year-over-year, we produced another quarter of positive operating
leverage while continuing to invest in new products and business initiatives to continue to drive organic growth.
On a linked-quarter basis, our efficiency ratio increased 140 basis points to 43.8% which includes the $4.1 million
of onetime expenses that Ken mentioned earlier. Despite progress we have made to reduce the asset sensitivity
and net interest income at risk, our efficiency ratio in 2019 was still affected by decline in NIM caused by the
falling rate environment. Adjusting NIM compression driven by the three Fed rate cuts, our efficiency ratio would
have remained flat from the year ago period.
As a core component of our strategy and irrespective of the rate environment, we will continue disciplined
expense management to maintain industry-leading operating leverage and profitability. Our pre-provision net
revenue ROA was 2.38% and return on assets was 1.92% for the quarter. The fourth quarter decline in operating
PPNR ROA of 25 basis points was directly related to the margin decline of 29 basis points over the same period.
These metrics continue to be in the top decile compared to peers.
Our strong balance sheet growth momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased $970 million to
$21.1 billion and deposit growth of $356 million brought our deposit balance to $22.8 billion at quarter-end. Our

loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 92.7% from 89.8% in Q3. Our strong liquidity position continues to provide us
with balance sheet flexibility to pursue attractive risk-adjusted lending opportunities.
We grew our shareholders' equity by $403 million to $3 billion from 2018 and tangible book value per share
increased $0.94 over the prior quarter and $4.47 or 20% over the prior year to $26.54 per share. Our industry-
leading financial performance is a direct result of our distinctive business model, which combines the commercial
banking relationships within our regional footprint and our national business lines.
Total loan growth was driven by increases in C&I loans of $674 million, residential loans of $285 million, and
commercial real estate nonowner occupied loans of $214 million. Strong C&I growth was supported by
approximately $175 million in Tech & Innovation and $228 million in mortgage warehouse lending. Residential
loans now comprise 10.2% of our loan portfolio, while construction loans decreased another $203 million and now
make up 9.2% of total loans at year-end versus 10.7% of total loans when compared to the prior quarter.
We believe our ability to profitably grow deposits is both a key differentiator and a core value driver to our
platform's long-term value creation. Despite Q4 being seasonally weak for deposits, we were able to grow them
$356 million for the quarter, a decrease of $218 million in noninterest-bearing DDA primarily from warehouse
lending was offset by growth in net interest-bearing DDAs and savings in money market accounts of $252 million
and $62 million, respectively.
Over the last year, deposits grew across all categories with the largest increases in savings and money market
deposit accounts of $1.8 billion and noninterest-bearing DDA of $1.1 billion. During 2019, deposit growth has
been $3.6 billion, of which 29.9% has been in noninterest-bearing accounts. The deposit growth of $3.6 billion for
the year was used to fully fund loan growth of $3.4 billion. Overall, asset quality remained stable with credit ratios
at historically low levels. Total adversely graded assets decreased $98 million during the quarter to $342 million
as special mention credits were reduced $53 million to 86 basis points of total assets.
From the prior year, total adversely graded assets have increased just $26 million versus a $3.4 billion rise in
loans, resulting in reduced ratio to total assets of 1.31% from 1.43%. Nonperforming assets comprised of loans on
nonaccrual and repossessed real estate increased marginally to $70 million or 0.26% to total asset and continue
to hold steady as a proportion of the balance sheet.
Regarding the reduction in total adversely graded assets as discussed last quarter, we view special mention loan
credits as an early indicator of potential stress that has little correlation to loan becoming nonperforming. Overall,
we've seen nothing in our portfolio that raises concerns or indicates a change in our credit outlook.
Gross credit losses of $2.2 million during the quarter were offset by $900,000 in recoveries resulting in net loan
losses of $1.2 million or 2 basis points of total loans annualized. The credit loss provision of $4 million remained
consistent with the prior quarter provisioning related to our loan growth also increased the allowance for loan and
lease losses to $167.8 million, up $15.1 million from a year ago, resulting in a reserve of 80 basis points of total
gross loans held for investment at December 31.
In advance with the adoption of CECL in the first quarter of 2020, we've included historical information on our
reserve for our unfunded loan commitment and credit discounts on acquired loans which we believe better
represents the total allowance for credit losses going forward. Inclusive of these additional reserves, our
allowance for credit loss ratio to total loans would have been 87 basis points in Q4.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Finally, regarding the transition to CECL in the first quarter of this year, we expect day one increase in reserves of
approximately $35 million or 20% which on an after-tax basis will reduce our tangible common equity ratio by
approximately 10 basis points. Assuming the economic backdrop, relative mix, level of loan growth, and the
duration of credits remains consistent, our go-forward allowance for loan losses will remain relatively stable at the
new CECL adoption reserve level of approximately 100 basis points which is inclusive of the $35 million day one
charge.
As a reminder, under prior GAAP, our provisioning was based upon an incurred loss model, while under CECL,
we're estimating lifetime losses and provisioning for them at the time of loan origination.
And finally, we continue to generate significant capital and maintain strong regulatory ratios with tangible common
equity to total assets of 10.3% and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.6%. Despite the payment of our quarterly
cash dividend of $0.25 per share, our tangible common equity per share rose $0.94 in the quarter to $26.54 and
is up 20% from a year earlier. Notably, our production of tangible book value has been more than three times that
of the peer group over the past six years. Given capital requirements that banks operate under, we believe that
consistent capital accretion is fundamental to value creation.
I'll turn the call back to Ken.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Thanks, Dale. On the heels of achieving several corporate milestones in 2019, we are excited by the growth
opportunities in both our regional and national business lines in 2020. We continue to hold to the belief that
predictable EPS and tangible book value growth will drive industry leading total shareholder returns.
In 2020, we expect to, one, continue to thoughtfully and conservatively grow loans. Our pipelines appear strong,
and we expect to grow loans between $600 million to $800 million per quarter, funded by deposit growth. Balance
sheet growth will drive net interest income growth despite marginal NIM compression. As deposits come back in
Q1 and Q2, our liquidity will rise placing some pressure on margin as we continue our residential real estate
diversification strategy.
Given the backdrop of a flat rate environment, our efficiency ratio should remain stable near current levels
throughout the year, even as we continue to invest in technology and new products. These actions should
position us to return to – excuse me – these actions should position us to continue industry leading return on
average assets and return on average tangible common equity.
At this time, we'll field your question. Operator, would you open up the line please.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes
from Timur Braziler of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.

Timur F. Braziler Q

Hi, good morning.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Starting with the margin, it looks like NIM benefited from some higher loan fees and pretty impressive reduction in
funding cost during the quarter. I'm just wondering how big of a step down do you think is going to take place in
1Q, assuming that loan fees normalize? And I would love to hear about your expectations on future possibilities to
cut deposit costs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So you're correct. It was a little higher and a little higher than what we guided to. I think the core margin for
the fourth quarter was about a 4.35%, if you kind of back that off. And then from there going forward, we are going
to continue to whittle down the margin based upon the execution of our residential mortgage program as that
becomes an increasingly large proportion of our loan portfolio.
We've stated that we think that's going to be maybe 2 basis points a month – a quarter. In any case, we can kind
of easily earn through that in terms of net interest income by the balance sheet growth that we expect to have. If
we don't see any more rate increases and I realize the futures market still has one in there, I think it might be
unlikely that we're going to see one frankly in 2020 before the election. But if we don't see any, I think the
opportunity for increased funding cost reduction is fairly limited. I think we have gotten the rates down a lot, and
we are in a little more of a compressed yield environment as we were on the way up when rates were lower. But
we can – we're good with the margins kind of in the 4.30% range and we believe we can execute upon that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. And then switching over to the expenses, as you look at the pipeline for future projects, expenses grew
roughly 15% on a core basis in 2019. Is that a good type of run rate to think of for 2020, or is the slower revenue
growth going to correlate to a slower expense growth?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, I expect that we're going to be able to hold our efficiency ratio essentially kind of where it is in the kind of the
lower 40s. And we believe that we can continue to grow with that and increase funds that we have. We've been
investing in to improve the products and services and the future functionality of our systems. During 2019, for
example, we had significant outlays to improve the experience for HOA clients. And that, we think was
instrumental to the very strong growth we had there. We expect to do the same. So I would look for our efficiency
to be fairly, our efficiency ratio to be fairly flat as we go through 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, just one last one for me. Looking at the residential mortgage growth and the punitive treatment of
resi mortgages under CECL, does that at all change your appetite to grow that lending category? And I guess,
how should we be thinking about provisioning as that becomes a larger component of the loan book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So it's only punitive if it has a kind of a large charge associated with it. Of course, residential loans do have
a larger – much longer duration than what some of our average loan length have been. And so, that could have
an effect. But the types of residential loans we're acquiring, that is LTVs in the 60s. FICOs 750, 760, debt-to-
income in the mid-30s. Those metrics result in a very low estimated annual charge-off. And so, even when I
multiply that by a duration factor, it's still a low number. So, increasing our proportion of our loan book into
residential is not going to be increasing our overall reserve in a CECL world above the 100 basis points. So, I
don't see an increase there. In fact, but I think it could dribble down slightly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to first ask just maybe about the competitive landscape in particular
and some of the national business lines like Mortgage Warehouse. Do you see an opportunity to take more
market share or grow at a faster rate than any of them in 2020 given some market disruption from acquisitions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. This is Ken. Overall, I would say the competitive landscape hasn't really changed for the entire book of
business. As it relates to Warehouse Lending, yeah, we see some opportunity for disruption there, and we see
some opportunity to take advantage both on the loan side and on the deposit side.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Okay. And just Dale, maybe a follow-up on the one-to-four family strategy, you mentioned continuing that this
year. What's kind of the overall eventual goal there? It sounds like you're pretty well-positioned from an ALCO
perspective right now, but should we expect you to go all the way to kind of a neutral balance on the ALCO?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I don't think we'll get that far. What we see about this is it strengthens the relationship with our Mortgage
Warehouse clients. It mitigates our interest rate risk. It positions us in an asset class that we think is going to
perform very well throughout the credit cycle. And we have very – [ph] in 2019 (00:29:14), we had very strong
deposit growth and it's like, well, this is a great go-to asset to take advantage of, to again improve earnings,
improve earnings per share growth. And we're getting yields well above what we could do if we're buying
residential mortgage-backed securities, for example. I don't expect this to necessarily get to 30% or something
like that where the peer group is. But we have plenty of runway to grow 2020, 2021, 2022, basically kind of the
same pace as we did in 2019, and we think that gives us a sustained kind of a growth model assuming that we
have the kind of the funding sources to be able to apply them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. Maybe just one last one on the share buyback versus dividend increase, kind of how are you guys feeling
about deploying capital through one versus the other at this point or are there M&A opportunities we should be
thinking of?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
So, for us, as you look at capital, when we started the year, we said that about two-thirds of our capital that's
generated is used to support organic growth. We ended the year with about three-quarters of the organic capital
that we generate to support growth. So our first and foremost best use of capital is for organic growth. The
dividend policy has been set. And then lastly, we'll be, as we always say, opportunistic when either the stock
show some weakness or the overall market show some weakness to come in and buy.

So, at this time, there's really nothing going on, on the M&A front, and we are rather quiet there as we see better
opportunities to grow our business organically. And quite frankly, that's where we're spending most of our time.

had in 2019. And by sticking organically, we'll see or have less execution risk with an organic strategy than if you
do an acquisition. In addition, the market has not been kind to acquiring banks as you know.
So, at this point, we're in the very fortunate place of saying we don't need to do an acquisition for revenue growth,
loan growth. We don't need to do an acquisition to take out expenses. And we don't need one so that we can
move our EPS or net income up. So we have as much optionality as one would want. And right now, as I said, all
quiet on the M&A front, and we're spending a lot of our time on looking how to continue to organically grow.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's great color. Thanks. Just one more. I think in the past, you've guided to that $600 million a quarter, Dale, of
growth. You've obviously come in well above that in recent quarters. I think the comments for $600 million to $800
million, is that just marking the market kind of how you've been performing, exceeding guidance, or is that – are
you trying to send a message that, hey, we feel even stronger about growth going into 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
We're building our plans around that $600 million to $800 million bogey there. Some quarters, it may be closer to
$600 million, and in some quarters, it may be $800 million or more. As you've seen, this quarter was $1 billion and
the last couple of quarters, it was $1 billion. So we are looking, and I think what – the most important thing here is
asset quality that will drive us to the right decision in terms of growth.
Right now, the asset quality appears good in our overall book. And we're not seeing a lot of deals that are being
won on structure, meaning they're loosening up covenants. We're not seeing that. So, we feel comfortable in this
$600 million to $800 million range. And you'll get to mark us to market at the end of next quarter and see how we
do against that.

One just following up on sort of the capital management, would you guys ever entertain a special dividend? That's
an option that you guys have not used. It could be compelling if the stock price seems high and the buyback is not
an option.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. First, let's remember we have a long history of dividend distributions of two consecutive quarters. And so, I
don't think we want to get ahead of that until at least we hit four. So we're going to continue on with the dividend
quarterly growth. We're going to always talk to the board about the best way to return capital to our shareholders.
And it's really – I think really too early at this point to start thinking about special dividends. Specifically, as you
see, we moved the amount of capital we're using for organic means up from two-thirds to three-quarters. So we
are trying to find good, thoughtful, conservative, managed loans to bring onto the balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. And to that end, so on the long growth front, if I look at slide 11 in your outlook for 2020, do you see that
the loan growth mix sort of tracking that – the loan growth mix in 2020 tracking that same level of C&I, resi and
CRE?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, the nice thing about our distinctive business model is that we get to move capital around all throughout the
year to take advantage of the best returns and where we think the credit is the strongest and where sometimes
competition is a little less active. So as we plan through the 2020 cycle, generally just about every business has
the same growth rate to try to achieve. As we execute, that becomes a different story, as we look almost daily or
weekly, as we look to move capital around to where we find the best opportunities. And that really has been the
success of one of the reasons Western Alliance has been so successful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I mean I would expect the construction piece – we're under $10 billion now to hover in that kind of the $9 billion to
$10 billion range. The residential is going to be – continue to climb from $10 billion now, I think that's going to
certainly go into the teens. And the others as Ken mentioned depend upon kind of the best risk adjusted returns
that we have within those categories.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Thanks. And just last question for me on credit quality. Dale, it sounds like the outlook is very clean, there's
nothing systemic that you see. I think we're all – everyone's very impressed with your ability to keep the NCOs
low. But I mean, when you – a lot of investors out there, I would say like it's only so sustainable given the risk
profile. Can you just give us some thoughts as to what when you see some of your peers catch a commercial
credit and the leverage loan book comes to mind specifically with you guys. What are you guys doing differently
that is enabling you to avoid catching these credits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
All right. This is Ken. First, I have to step back, big picture, our portfolio today looks fine. We don't see any
economic stress from the economy. And to answer your more specific question, we think our well-diversified
portfolio, which again is consistent with this business model we have, helps us to avoid some pitfalls. So, for
example, we don't do energy loans. We've gotten out of solar. We have very little QSR loans on the books. We

don't have large retail malls. These are all things that we have stopped doing years ago or maybe a year ago. So
we're trying to look for where we see there – where there's possibles of the credit hiccups and avoid that.
Next, back to the National Business Lines, the National Business Lines, for the most part, we've never seen
losses. So, let's go through timeshare. We've never had a loss, and the team that's running it has never had a
loss in 35 years. Warehouse lending, we've had that business 10 going on, 11 years. Never had a loss. Municipal
lending, we've had one small loss for $400,000 over the last 10 years. Even our hotel book is very well positioned
when I – if you want to talk about our debt service coverage ratio or LTV, and our debt yields, for example. So
we've been fortunate to be playing in spaces in the national business lines that other banks do not play in. And
remember, the national business lines have four characteristics to them. One, generally, there's less competition,
which allows us to have fairly good pricing power or pricing stability, good operating leverage, and last but not
least as I described, good asset quality. And Dale, you want to add anything to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. Regarding the corporate finance notes that you mentioned, we monitor those. Those are liquid loans and
we monitor that pricing daily. If there is a price deterioration that's going on, if we don't understand why that is, it's,
you know what, sell first and then ask questions later. So, we'll cut a particular haircut down or something like that
and get out. And we really move quickly on those types of deals.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. We've been rather fortunate that through most of our businesses, we've not had large attrition in our
revenue producers. I will say it's a little more competitive up in Northern California in the Tech & Innovation
business. But relatively speaking, we're not pushing heavily to bring in new producers given the runway that we
see in front of us.

And some of the businesses that we started, certainly on the loan initiatives that we started in 2018 and 2019,
both of our two loan initiatives had great results. So, we brought in people there earlier in 2018 and we need to
get them comfortable with our way of doing business. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
In terms of the FTE increase, a good portion of that has really been to increase infrastructure. So, those have
been in operations and IT areas and also kind of personnel development for that. As Tim mentioned, most of the
positions we've had in terms of frontline producers have been fairly static over the past year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yes. So, that's where my next question. It sounds like you've got plenty of capacity on staff without really having
to add any additional revenue producers in a big way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yes. I think that's fair.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And maybe as a follow-up, as you look at your $600 million to $800 million quarterly loan and deposit goal, which
side of that would be – looks easier to attain against a backdrop of being maybe more selective with credit versus
it's always difficult to grow deposits. Just kind of curious which pipeline might be bigger or which side of that
equation you kind of feel better about as you move through the year based on kind of what you see in the
pipeline.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
It's funny, all pipeline conversations change almost weekly depending on when deals are going to close or when
people are making their customer calls. So, quite frankly, they both have the same probability of occurring. I just
think you may see some – we're not that good to make sure every quarter is exactly lined up. But if you look at
2019 as an example, it did eventually line up very, very well. If you go back to 2019 Q1, deposits came out of the
chute very, very strong, loans were okay, and then it ended just the reverse with loans being very strong and
deposits being okay. But net-net, loans grew $3.4 billion, deposits grew $3.6 billion. So, that's what we're trying to
do is to kind of as I said in my outlook, to have deposits match the loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I like getting the deposits in. I like leading with deposits. I think that gives you – that really gives you inventory that
you can find alternatives. Hey, if it's a bad economy, we can go to residential. If we think things are growing,
we've got a more expansive kind of product array on the loan side that we can offer. If we continue to sustain
good core deposit growth, that's going to drive improving earnings per share.

Thanks. Just one question for me in terms of the $4 million of nonrecurring items in the quarter. Could you give
any detail on that? Was it severance? Was it tax write-down? Just any kind of back background there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, I mean, it kind of enumerated a little bit. But, yeah, so we had a very strong 2019. We had an accrual
catch-up in terms of incentive compensation that we recognized. We continue to build out, as I mentioned, on one
particular product regarding HOA, but both infrastructure regarding future functionality of products, regulatory
compliance and sustaining what we need to do there as well. So it's a little bit elevated in the fourth quarter in
terms of kind of what those charges came in. But in some respects, they're going to continue. As I mentioned,
we're going to expect to have basically a stable efficiency ratio going forward, which means that our revenue
growth in dollars is going to be more than double what we're going to be increasing in expense.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
So, we got in front of I think the market as rates were coming down and we moved within hours after each of the
Fed changes. And today, where we see our pricing relative to kind of the competitive environment is, we don't see
that we've got a whole lot of latitude relative to what others are paying. And of course, we have these kind of –
everyone does, these online banks that are charging or providing returns much, much higher than what local
institutions do.
So, that doesn't mean there isn't some kind of changes we can kind of make on the margin. But I think people
have kind of settled into that kind of the term structure of the yield curve that we have today. And I think it's been
fairly quiet out there for rate changes not just for us, but for the market of late as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And others have asked about this as well, but within that resi portfolio, and these rates 4.75% loan yields,
let's say 140 bps above agency conforming. Could you talk about what's in there in a little bit more detail?
Number one. And number two, as this portfolio grows relative to other components, do you think there could be a
leak down in the reserve given that this may have a lower – some benefit under CECL which you may have
alluded to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. It does have some benefit under CECL and it could kind of wiggle down maybe over time. Of course,
CECL, you're always in this process of kind of reconfirming and testing and testing your models and back testing
them. So there could be other changes that will take place. But – so a couple of things. One is, we are not
intending to buy agency qualifying paper. So, that is part of the reason that picks us up in yield.
So we're not expecting to kind of bundle this up and ship it off to Fannie, Freddie or anything like that. So, from
our warehouse clients, we're buying some of the stuff that doesn't qualify to their primary liquidity channel, which
is one of these GSEs. So what do we buy? So there's some jumbo in there. It's not a lot. The average balance on
this stuff is under $500,000, but there is some jumbo that doesn't qualify.
There's this significant piece of something that isn't owner occupied. So these could be vacation home or
something else that could make it ineligible for these agencies to pick up. But again, we're looking for things that
improve the yield to us, but don't increase the risk. So again, these are really low – these are low LTV loans.
They're good to high FICO scores, but they're not necessarily their primary residence. We also look for things that
are – maybe there's some defect in the process that makes them ineligible for it. There's been like timing on right
of rescission. There's been of...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. A couple of questions for you. So a follow-up first on the deposit discussion. What's giving you
confidence on the deposit side to fund that increased growth of $600 million to $800 million? Is it new initiatives or
getting more entrenched in existing businesses? Just curious there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I think there are a couple of things. One, the way our business is structured. A, we have an HOA business –
again, you heard us say – that grew deposits over $600 million. We put money against different technology. We
think that technology improvement has allowed us to bring in more deposits this year. So that channel helps us.
The Tech & Innovation channel generally brings in deposits on a two-to-one basis. Our Warehouse Lending
channel, with all the ways we touch the Warehouse Lending clients, allows us to bring in deposits that are one-to-
one. So we have a number of channels that create its own natural momentum for us to grow.
And then, the things we always say we're a pay-for-performance culture, so everyone's out looking to get
deposits. We don't do a loan without getting the operating accounts. We've got minimum liquidity requirements in
our loan docs. In case you don't hold your deposits at a certain level, we have an opportunity to re-price your loan,
your yield. So it's all those things.
As it relates to the loan initiatives, we've gotten a little traction on the deposit initiatives. We've gotten a little
traction there. We grew both of those over $100 million. We are still keeping our eye on that. We'd rather be a
little slower and right and give the clients the best customer service experience than to be fast, bring in stuff and
not service the client. And since we have the opportunity through these other channels to bring in deposits, we
can take it a little slower on the new initiatives and wait to when we feel ready to go out and bring them in at a
faster pace.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
But our new initiatives had a great year, I mean Tech & Innovation up $1 billion, HOA up $600 million. So it's been
both.

David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And should we expect a similar mix in that deposit growth between interest-bearing and
noninterest-bearing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. I think if we can hold our own on interest-bearing dollars, I think that's doing pretty well on noninterest-
bearing dollars. So, I mean I could see over time and particularly if rates rise, that's going to be a little more
difficult. So I would like to hold our own dollars on the noninterest-bearing side. Maybe most of the growth comes
from interest-bearing.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
A couple of follow-ups. Can you talk about going where competition is less active? Is that the case in the CLD
book? I'm just curious. The yields look good and you're a little bit under 10%. And just curious what your thought
is on that book going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, on that book, we're going to float between 9% and 10%. This quarter, as it relates to the percentage,
you saw both a numerator and a denominator impact. Denominator went up $1 billion, and we focused on the
numerator and that came down $203 million. We primarily did that through pricing. So we priced up a little bit. We
did get some deals at our pricing. And the ones we didn't get, well, we waited for loans to roll off the books. We
didn't replace them. And that's how we brought the ratio down. But some of the aspects of what we do in that
book, the competition is not any more competitive than it's been for the last two or three years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. And then, your ability to get there a year early, it's just simply what you just said pricing and letting
some things roll off?

You talked a bit about the Mortgage Warehouse. Anything else to call out in that segment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I don't think anything pops right off the top of my head. I think it's really the growth was in those segments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then, last one. Tech spending is the other area that you called out in your expense guidance. You
mentioned HOA, but talk a little bit about the initiatives and where you're spending the tech money, where it's
focused? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, our spending is really targeted against the client satisfaction and offering products and improved
service. And my hypothesis is that I think a lot of banks are going to pull back in 2020, because they don't have
the growth aspects that we have. And I think they're going to service their clients to the level that the clients want
to be serviced at. So, I think by continuing to improve our service offering, I think; one, we'll have a happy
clientele; and number two, as you saw in HOA, we'll be able to either hold deposits or bring in more deposits.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. When I compared the management outlook slide in
for 2020 in the deck released yesterday to the outlook slide last year, you guys kept the loan and deposit growth
the same; the interest margin, the same; the operating leverage, the same; and the asset quality, the same. But
this year, you added earnings to it. Obviously, the outlook is very favorable that you guys have talked about so far
on this call. I'm just curious given that you added that to the slide, if you wanted to comment just around the pace
of earnings growth, or how comfortable you felt with the earnings growth in 2020, especially given a lot of your
peers are not growing earnings. Thanks.

Yeah. One, it's good to hear that we are rather consistent year-over-year with loan and deposit growth, interest
margin, operating leverage, and asset quality. The point of earnings was the cumulative effect of all that will
produce year-over-year earnings. And again, as we said in our prepared remarks, higher earnings, higher tangible
book value will lead to a better valuation over the long term. And to distinguish ourselves from our peer group,
that may have a little trouble growing earnings, I think only helps us.

Okay. Thanks, Ken. And then, just going back to the buyback, would you expect to fully utilize the authorization
this year?

I'm not going to make a forecast on that, other than to say, think about how we've done it so far, and I think we've
done it in a very managed and prudent way. When there's plenty of growth, that growth is supported by capital.
We realized we are running with a little more capital, we initiated a dividend. And if – again, if the stock looks
weak, if the market takes down everyone, we'll have enough ammunition to come in and support the stock and
buy what we hope will be at attractive pricing.

Vecchione for any closing remarks.
