We urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Q which are
available on our Investor Relations website. During today's call, we will also use certain non-GAAP financial
measures to provide information pertinent to our management view of ongoing business performance. A
reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to most comparable GAAP measures may be found in the schedules
accompanying our press release and presentation.
With that, I'll turn it over to Chairman and CEO, Paul Reilly. Paul?

Paul Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Kristie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. It has been a year since the
financial markets bottomed and the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates to near zero. That move
reduced our pre-tax run rate by 40%. The stock market has seen an incredible run since 2020 with the S&P 500
up 54% year-over-year. While that tailwind has certainly helped fuel our strong results, the records we generated
during the quarter and first half of the fiscal year have also been driven by our unwavering commitment to
providing excellent service to advisors and their clients during this difficult and unprecedented time. It's a
testament to our advisors who have shepherded their clients through the pandemic and the wherewithal of our
associates who have worked so hard to service our advisors and their clients, our strong balance sheet and our
ability to grow both in constructive and challenging markets, certainly a year we will never forget on many levels.
Starting on slide 3, the fiscal second quarter was another record quarter. The firm reported record net revenues of
$2.37 billion which were up 15% over the prior year's fiscal second quarter and 7% over the preceding quarter.
Record net income of $355 million or $2.51 per diluted share increased 110% over net income in the year ago
quarter and 14% over the preceding quarter. Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 19% and return on
tangible common equity was 21.2%, an extremely impressive result especially in this near-zero rate environment
and given our strong capital position.
Record quarterly revenues were primarily driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees,
investment banking revenues and record brokerage revenues, which more than offset the negative impact of
lower short-term interest rates on both the net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks. Record
quarterly net income was attributable to the record revenues, disciplined management of controllable expenses,
the bank loan loss benefit of $32 million reflecting improving economic conditions and subdued business
development expenses given the lack of business travel and conferences.
Moving to slide 4, we ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.09 trillion which
were up 40% on a year-over-year basis and 6% sequentially. We also achieved records for PCG assets in fee-
based accounts of $568 billion, a 7% sequential improvement which will benefit the third quarter, and financial
assets under management of $178 billion.
We ended the quarter with a record 8,327 financial advisors, a net increase of 179 over the prior year's period and
94 over the preceding quarter. This represents a solid improvement over the prior quarter and reflects our strong
retention and the continued strength of our recruiting pipelines across all of our affiliation options. Our recruiting
momentum in the independent side of the business continues to be strong.
On the employee side, as we mentioned last quarter, in response to the increased recruiting packages by
competitors, we enhanced our recruiting packages to be more competitive while also ensuring attractive returns to
our shareholders. And while recruiting momentum in this business has increased greatly, employee advisory
count is down slightly from the prior quarter as improved recruiting was offset by a higher number of retirements

where assets are typically retained at the firm as well as the smaller training class. However, the number of
advisors scheduled to join is up significantly, not only in our employee channel, but across all of our affiliation
options.
Looking at our recruiting results, over the prior four quarters, financial advisors with approximately $285 million of
trailing 12 months' production and nearly $44 billion of assets at their prior firms affiliated with Raymond James
domestically. As for our net organic growth results in the Private Client Group, we generated domestic PCG net
new assets of nearly $54 billion over the four quarters ending in March 31, 2021, representing more than a 7.5%
of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the period. And remember, this is net of client fees. And this trend
has accelerated during the first half of the fiscal year closer to a 9% annualized rate. We are very pleased with our
consistent organic growth especially given the disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic during the
year.
Now let's move to the segment results on slide 5. The Private Client Group generated record quarterly net
revenues of $1.65 billion and pre-tax income of $192 million and 11.7% pre-tax margin reflecting significant
operating leverage despite being in a near-zero rate environment. Quarterly net revenues grew 12% over the
preceding quarter predominantly driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, reflecting
higher assets in fee-based accounts, which will continue to be a tailwind in the third quarter. Higher brokerage
revenues also contributed to the quarterly revenue growth.
The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $433 million and pre-tax income of $105
million, driven by record brokerage revenue, record equity underwriting and strong M&A revenues despite not
topping the extra ordinarily strong and record-breaking first quarter results. The results this quarter were very
strong driven by broad-based strength across global equities and investment banking and fixed income
businesses.
The strong results reflect the significant investments we have made to strengthen our platform over the last 10
years and we are continuing to make investments including the recent acquisition of the consumer-focused M&A
advisory firm Financo, which closed at the end of the quarter and we welcome Financo to the Raymond James
family.
The Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $209 million and record pre-tax income of
$87 million. Record results were primarily due to growth of financial assets under management driven by equity
market appreciation and net inflows into fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group. Carillon Tower Advisers
also generated significant net inflows during the quarter.
Lastly, Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $160 million and pre-tax income of $111
million. Quarterly net revenues declined 24% compared to a year ago quarter primarily due to the impact of lower
short-term interest rates. Sequentially quarterly net revenues declined 4% as higher asset balances were offset
by the expected 8 basis points decline in the Bank's net interest margin during the quarter which was also largely
attributable to the agency-backed securities portfolio. Pre-tax income growth was primarily due to the loan loss
reserve release in the quarter compared to the provision for credit losses in both of the comparative periods. The
credit quality of the Bank's portfolio remains healthy as Paul Shoukry will cover in more detail in his remarks.
Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on slide 6, we generated record net revenues of $4.59 billion during the
first six months of the fiscal 2021, up 13% over the same period. Record earnings per diluted share of $4.74
increased 53% compared to the first six months of fiscal 2020 primarily due to the revenue growth along with the
loan loss reserve release compared to the provision for credit losses in the comparative period.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
Moving to the fiscal year-to-date results on slide 7, the Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset
Management segments generated record net revenues and record pre-tax income during the first six months of
the fiscal year. In fact, Capital Markets segment's pre-tax income for the first half of the fiscal year of $234 million
actually exceeded the annual record of $225 million set in fiscal 2020. Again, these results reinforce the value of
our diverse and complementary businesses.
And now, for a more detailed review of the financial results, I'll turn the call over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. I'll begin with consolidated revenues on slide 9. Record quarterly net revenues of $2.37 billion
grew 15% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As expected, Asset Management fees grew 10% sequentially, a
bit lower than the 12% growth of fee-based assets during the preceding quarter, primarily due to two fewer billable
days during the quarter. Private Client Group assets in fee-based accounts were up 7% during the fiscal second
quarter, providing a tailwind for this line item for the third quarter of fiscal 2021.
Consolidated brokerage revenues of $591 million grew 15% over the prior year and represent a record driven by
continued strength in institutional fixed income as well as strong brokerage revenues in the Private Client Group
reflecting healthy client activity levels and higher asset values. Accounting service fees of $159 million declined
8% year-over-year, almost entirely due to the decrease in RJBDP fees from third-party banks given lower short-
term interest rates, which I will discuss along with net interest income in more detail on the next two slides. The
10% sequential increase was largely attributable to higher asset balances and revenues from our recent
acquisition of NWPS, most of which are reflected in the client account and other fees line in the PCG segment.
Consolidated investment banking revenues of $242 million grew 64% year-over-year driven by strong M&A
advisory revenues and record equity underwriting revenues. For the first half of the year, investment banking
revenues were 74% higher than the first half of fiscal 2020. Our investment banking pipelines remain strong. So
we would be really pleased to finish the fiscal year averaging $200 million or better of investment banking
revenues per quarter if market conditions remain conducive. Other revenues of $44 million are down 21%
sequentially primarily due to lower private equity valuation gains during the quarter, partially offset by a strong
quarter for the tax credit funds business.
Moving to slide 10, clients' domestic cash sweep balances, which are the primary source of funding for interest-
earning assets and the balances with third-party banks that generate RJBDP fees, ended with a quarter end
record of $62.8 billion, increasing 2% sequentially and representing 6.5% of domestic PCG client assets. As we
continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks, more client cash is being
held in the client interest program at the broker dealer. You can see those balances grew to $9.5 billion and most
of that growth has been used to purchase short-term treasuries to meet the associated reserve requirement. Over
time, that cash could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available which would
hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries.
On slide 11, the top chart displays our firm-wide net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a
combined basis as these two items are directly impacted by change in short-term interest rates. Related, we have
updated the net interest margin or NIM chart on the bottom left portion of this slide to show NIM for both Raymond
James Bank and the firm overall. The combined net interest income and BDP fees from third-party banks declined
a bit sequentially largely due to fewer days during the quarter and NIM compression at the Bank.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
As I mentioned on the last quarter's call, we would expect the Bank's NIM to decline to around 1.9% over the next
two quarters as new agency security purchases have lower yield in the runoff, but still represent a higher yield
than we are earning from third-party banks or in short-term treasuries. We also believe the average yield on
RJBDP balances with third-party banks will remain close to 30 basis points for the rest of the fiscal year, but that
could experience downward pressure in fiscal 2022 if Bank's demand for deposits doesn't improve from current
levels.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 12, first, compensation expense which is by far our largest expense. As
expected, the compensation ratio increased sequentially from 67.5% to 69.5% largely due to the revenue mix shift
towards higher compensable revenues in the PCG segment as financial advisor payouts, particularly on the
independent contractor side of the business where they cover most of their overhead costs, are typically much
higher than the associated compensation in the other businesses.
On a sequential basis, the compensation ratio was also impacted by the reset of payroll taxes that occurs in the
first calendar quarter of each year. As we explained on the last call, given our current revenue mix and disciplined
management of expenses, we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of 70% or better in this near-
zero short-term interest rate environment. Non-compensation expenses of $277 million decreased 32% compared
to last year's second quarter and 14% sequentially primarily driven by the $32 million bank loan loss benefit
compared to provisions in the comparative periods.
Business development expenses also remain subdued, but we expect those to increase over the next few
quarters as business travel picks back up and conferences and recognition trips resume. Overall, you can see we
have been really focused on managing controllable expenses while still investing in growth and ensuring high
service levels for advisors and their clients.
Slide 13 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. Pre-tax margin was 18.8% in fiscal second
quarter of 2021 which was boosted by record revenues, the loan loss reserve release and subdued business
development expenses. On the last call, we talked about generating a 14% to 15% pre-tax margin in this near-
zero interest rate environment, but as we experienced during the first half of the fiscal year, there's meaningful
upside to our margin when Capital Markets results are so strong.
On slide 14, at the end of the quarter, total assets were $56.1 billion, a 4% sequential increase reflecting the
dynamic I explained earlier with growth in client cash balances and associated segregated assets at the broker
dealer as well as solid growth of corporate loans and security-based loans at Raymond James Bank. This
balance sheet growth caused our Tier 1 leverage ratio to decrease to 12.2% which is still well above the
regulatory requirements and our more conservative target of 10%. Liquidity remains very strong with $1.7 billion
of cash at the parent at the end of the quarter leaving us with plenty of flexibility to be defensive and opportunistic.
During the quarter, we announced a debt offering which closed at the beginning of our fiscal third quarter. So it
was not reflected in any of the second quarter's numbers. To take advantage of the low rate environment, we
raised $750 million of 30-year senior notes at 3.75% and utilize the proceeds and cash on hand to early redeem
our next two senior note maturities effectively resulting in the same amount of senior notes outstanding, but with a
much longer-term stable funding profile.
In the third quarter, we expect to record losses associated with the early extinguishment of these notes which
should total somewhere around $90 million. To help with comparability, we'll break those losses out as a non-
GAAP adjustment in the fiscal third quarter.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
Slide 15 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. In the second quarter, we
repurchased 500,000 shares for $60 million, an average price of approximately $120 per share. Over the first two
quarters of the fiscal year, we repurchased shares for $70 million and we remain committed to repurchasing a
total of at least $200 million in fiscal 2021 to offset share-based compensation dilution. As of April 28, $680 million
remained under the current share repurchase authorization.
Lastly on slide 16, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. The credit quality of the Bank's loan
portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve. Non-performing assets remained low at 9 basis
points of total assets. However, criticized loans increased due to a handful of credit downgrades within our REIT
portfolio, particularly in the hospitality sector.
While all of those credits we downgraded continue to perform, have large cash balances and are starting to see
improvement in their portfolios, we thought it was prudent to downgrade those credits. We had net charge-offs of
$2 million in the quarter which were related to opportunistic loan sales of $95 million at nearly 99% of par value.
The Bank loan loss benefit of $32 million was largely attributable to the macroeconomic inputs in the CECL model
which reflect an improved outlook, particularly for the commercial real estate and residential mortgage loan
portfolios.
Due to reserve releases and the loan growth during the quarter, the Bank loan allowance for credit losses as a
percentage of total loans declined from 1.71% to 1.50% at quarter end. For the corporate loan portfolios, these
allowances are higher at around 2.6%. We believe we are adequately reserved, but that could change if economic
conditions deteriorate. Our strong balance sheet and long-term focus was recently cited as a strength by Fitch
Ratings who launched its long-term senior unsecured rating for Raymond James Financial of A minus with a
stable outlook.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you. So overall a year into the global health pandemic with near-zero short-term interest rates and during a
quarter with lots of seasonal headwinds such as fewer billable days and the reset of payroll taxes, I could not be
more pleased with our record top and bottom line results this quarter. As for our outlook, we remained well
positioned entering the third fiscal quarter with records for all of our key business metrics, strong financial advisor
recruiting activity and robust pipelines for investment banking.
In the Private Client Group segment while the recruiting environment is competitive and we face some challenges
in a largely virtual environment, our financial advisor recruiting pipeline is strong across all of our affiliation options
and the segment is going to benefit by starting the fiscal third quarter with a 7% sequential increase in assets in
fee-based accounts. The enhancements we made to the recruiting packages on the employees side of the
business have been very well received by prospective advisors and that pipeline has recovered nicely.
Our prospective advisors across all of our affiliation options have continued to be attracted by our leading
technology solutions. We have been known for our industry-leading position and mobile advisor tools and
continue to make our technology platform more robust. We have also created easy-to-use systems that put all the
information advisors need right at their fingertips, so they can easily get the information they need to service their
clients and have more time taking care of their clients and growing their business.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
As we continue to invest in our technology, we're extremely excited about the new enhancements which will be
coming out shortly. We have been measuring our client satisfaction for the past 10 years using Net Promoter
Scores. And I'm proud to share that our client satisfaction has never been higher both in terms of satisfaction with
Raymond James as well as satisfaction with their advisors. In the Capital Markets segment, although there is still
economic uncertainty due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the investment banking pipeline remains strong
and we expect fixed income brokerage results to remain elevated particularly in the depositary clients segment
where we have a leadership position.
In the Asset Management segment, results will be positively impacted by higher financial assets under
management as long as the equity markets remain resilient. We were also pleased to see positive net flows for
Carillon Tower Advisers in the quarter despite the structural headwinds for active asset managers. We hope that
the one benefit of increased market volatility is that it reinforces the value of high-quality active asset managers.
And Raymond James Banks should continue to benefit from the attractive growth of securities-based loans and
mortgages to the Private Client Group segment. On a year-over-year basis, the growth of the securities-based
loans has been impressive around 38%. We'll also continue to be selective and deliberate in growing the
corporate loan portfolio and the agency-backed securities portfolio as we have ample funding and capital to grow
the balance sheet. We continue to focus on long-term growth and our priorities remain unchanged. Our top
priority is organic growth, which is primarily driven by retaining and recruiting advisors in the Private Client Group.
Additionally, we are continuing to add senior talent to all of our businesses.
We also continue to actively pursue acquisitions, but we will still be deliberate and only pursue transactions that
are a great cultural and strategic fit and at prices that we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. We
have been even more proactive in sourcing and evaluating opportunities.
On Earth Day last week, we released our first corporate responsibility report. The report summarizes our
foundational commitments to people, sustainability, community and governance and illustrates our longstanding
approach to doing business, rooted in our values and brought to life through our people-driven culture. This report
summarizes many of the inspiring things that our advisors and associates across the firm do to contribute to their
communities and the things we do as a firm to help the environment. We look forward to building on this inaugural
report by maintaining transparency and sharing progress over time.
With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bill Katz with
Citigroup. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. So I guess the first one is I presume in more detail
we'll follow up on the Investor Day next month. But I was wondering if you could maybe provide a little more
discussion or disclosure around the Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10% maybe the timeline or the pathway and I guess
this quarter with a very strong loan growth and so a stepped up buyback, the blueprint that we should expect
going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Hey, Bill. Good morning and great question. As you said, we will discuss that in a lot more detail at the upcoming
Analyst/Investor Day. And really the decline to 12.2% this quarter was primarily attributable to the increase in
client cash balances and we're accommodating more of that on our balance sheet at the broker dealer frankly
because the third-party bank demand with all of the banks flush with cash right now has declined. At the broker
dealer, we are, to fulfill the associated reserve requirement, repurchasing short-term – are repurchasing short-
term treasuries, and we hope that we can over time redeploy that into more profitable growth at the Bank.
But in terms of how we think about getting the 10% over time, it's really going to be a combination of growing the
balance sheet which primarily occurs for us at Raymond James Bank, as you know. You alluded to the strong
loan growth in the quarter of 4%. We are still being very deliberate in growing the portfolio both the Private Client
Group loans. Securities-based loans grew almost 40% year-over-year and mortgages have seen good growth as
well, although there's been a high degree of runoffs and refinancing there. And we're starting to really be
deliberate in growing the corporate loan portfolio, although there still continues to be more demand and supply in
the market with banks being flushed with cash.
And then the second component of managing the capital ratio is really deploying the capital. You saw us do the
buybacks this quarter to offset the dilution. We'll continue to do that and be opportunistic if the prices are at
attractive levels and then of course you just heard Paul mention the focus on acquisitions as well as another way
to deploy capital.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And just to follow up, so coming back to the commentary that the organic growth accelerated in
the sort of last couple of quarters to 9% which is quite impressive. Wondering if you can maybe fill that back a
little bit more and maybe talk to, like, the organic growth between the different channels and I think maybe a little
more color around the recruitment backdrop. Thank you.

I'd say in two levels. Yeah, sure. If you look at – I know a lot of people record quarterly and semiannually, so as
you know, we do annual, so we thought we'd give the indication that we're approaching 9% for the first six months
which is a great number. The growth has been kind of proportional to the channels, we're finding our advisors who
are just bringing in assets and clients even in this market which they've consistently done and the top producers
have really had very impressive results in their growth. So it's happening everywhere.
And then on recruitment, we measure – we don't publish what we call commits, and those are people saying I'm
coming. What you see are the people that sign. So it's like almost M&A, right. You're in a transaction, but we don't
count until it closes. It's the same in recruiting. But our commits are way up in every channel, all of our channels.
And now some of those people may not join or they may delay the join which often will happen for just logistics
reasons and it might slip into the next quarter. But based on the backlog, it is very, very robust. So I think we
posted good numbers this quarter and my guess is in all channels you're going to see better numbers next
quarter, so.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. You had a pretty strong quarter for investment banking across the board. Can you give us
some more color on the backlog? I think you mentioned it remains strong, but maybe you can compare it to the
start of the fiscal second quarter. And then your pre-tax margins in the Capital Markets division declined Q-on-Q.
It was a pretty strong revenue environment, so I was wondering if there is any seasonality there or should we
expect margins in that segment to stay at these levels in this kind of an environment for trading.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So let me start on kind of the revenue side. I'll let Paul address the margin side a little bit because there's
lots of moving parts in all of these. On the revenue side honestly and Paul talked about $200 million plus, we're at
record levels, right. So every time you have records you always wonder. But if you look at the backlog, you would
see no reason why it would slow. Now, again M&A is one of those deals where economy can change, people can
pull out of deals, so they can get delayed. So you'd never know, but the backlog would say it's as robust as ever.
The market's active, I think, for everyone, and our backlog is very, very strong and continuing to sign new deals
even as of this last week that were pretty significant. So we feel pretty good about the backlog.
Paul, you want to talk about the margin level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean the margin certainly bounced around a little bit from quarter to quarter, but at 24% for the quarter,
that's still a fantastic margin for the Capital Markets segment. And when you look year-to-date, I think it's 26%. So
revenues were down a bit sequentially, M&A still had a very strong quarter, but it was down 18% from the record
M&A results last quarter and that is a high margin revenue source. So, again it could bounce around, but at these
levels, we're still really pleased with a 26% margin year-to-date.

Great. And then maybe on the loan growth side, you saw some nice loan growth as you mentioned in the real
estate and SBL portfolio this quarter. Are you doing anything differently there, any change in underwriting given
how much the macro environment has improved and – with markets at all-time highs or is this just increased
penetration of your existing customer base?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would say it's not relaxed underwriting. So I think it is better processing and trying to get – make it a
smoother process, the underwriting standards are the same as ever. But I do think our advisors in this market and
a lot of people as their estate and tax planning are using the tools. So we are advertising to our advisors, we don't
go direct to their clients, the availability and the use of these tools in financial planning. But it's their choice and
their clients' choice. We don't market directly to the end client, but given that and I think the educational process
and the dynamics of the market, we've had significant growth and still see that channel is very active. So,
compared to our bigger peers, we are in much lower penetration. So we think there's more opportunity.

Hey. Maybe start with one here just on the strength in Private Client brokerage revenues in the quarter. I heard
some of the commentary, but it'd be great just to get a little more color on what you guys are seeing in that
business? And if you can, how much of the sequential improvement was from trailing commissions versus just
activity? And really what I'm trying to do is just parse through how much of that business is benefiting from a
bigger base and higher assets versus maybe something that was a little bit unusually active in the backdrop?

Hey, Devin. That's a great question. There were really strong brokerage revenues in the Private Client Group
business. A lot of that reflects the healthy level of client engagement, just given the market opportunities. When
you look at that kind of $413 million of brokerage revenues, roughly 50% of it is asset-based and the other 50% is
11

transactional-based. And then it varies by line. For example, the mutual fund line, 65% to 70% of that is asset-
based. And so, obviously that has grown nicely as assets have grown and the [ph] net trail (37:15) commissions
have grown as well. But you can also see that the transactional commissions from equities, ETFs and fixed
incomes, they're up 13% sequentially as well. So, good level of client activity. Obviously the asset growth helps
there as well. There were some lumpy placement fees in that brokerage revenues in Private Client Group this
quarter. But that happens from time to time. But that certainly was another benefit during the quarter as well.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Yeah. Okay. That's really good color. Thanks, Paul. And then maybe another kind of modeling question. Just
thinking about the comp ratio moving parts. I appreciate the mixed dynamics particularly as you have strong
quarters in the independent brokerage channel and if you could put some upward pressure all else equal. But
then you also highlighted some of the seasonal items like payroll taxes. So if we look at that 200 basis point
sequential increase, I'm not sure if it's – you're able to kind of parse through how much is a drag from the
seasonal peace or even if you can kind of quantify how much the payroll taxes affected the comp. If I'm looking at
like the other segment, for example, there was a $10 million increase. I'm sure you saw increases in any other
pieces, but it's still a little bit tough to parse through, that would be really helpful if you give any color there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. It is a great question, Devin, and we try to parse through it ourselves. There's a lot of moving parts there
because there's also elevated payroll taxes with our year-end bonuses for those who haven't hit the threshold. So
in the past, we've said it's been $10 million or so sequentially in terms of the impact. But I would tell you the comp
ratio as I said on last quarter's call really the biggest driver there was just the increase in compensable revenues
in the Private Client Group business. That has an average payout between the employee and independent
channel as you know of around 75%. And so we want those revenues to grow as much as possible obviously and
they're going to grow, all else being equal, in the third quarter because fee-based revenues grew, our assets grew
7% during the quarter, so that's going to be a tailwind to compensable revenues in the Private Client Group
business. So it really is a mix issue more than anything else as we have really been focused on managing the
controllable expense as much as we possibly can.

the increase? And could you also speak to some of the additional differentiated technology in your platform
relative to peers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yes. So on the transition assistance, it became clear as a number of firms, not all, had raised it significantly. We
were not even closed in the market and especially for large teams. And so looking, we knew we had room from a
return standpoint. So on those large teams, I would say now when we come in to the finals, we're not the highest,
but we're in the ballpark. And so enough that people are saying they're willing to make the trade for the dollars for
the culture and the values when we had deals that literally were almost twice as much as ours, it was hard for
people to turn down the money, even though they might have preferred coming here.
So we aren't the highest. We are competitive and we think it's a fair package both – and a good return for us. So
we're feeling that we're well positioned and appropriately positioned, and I think it's going to reflect in the numbers
and a lot of very, very high quality teams, probably the largest number of large teams that we've had, that's
certainly in memory, so which means they're probably the largest group of large teams we've ever had in the
recruiting pipeline. I'm sorry and your second question was...

If you can just expand on some of the differentiated technology in your platform relative to some of your peers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So our focus for a long time had been on the advisors desktop. We've had a lot of peers that focused on
the end client desktop some because they were going direct to their end clients. We first wanted to put all the
capabilities into our advisors desktop. So it's been many years now since we've been completely mobile. Our
advisors could do almost everything from their iPhones that they could do from their desktop and making sure that
our advisors had all the latest tools, planning tools and completely mobile very, very early on. Now not only we
are enhancing those platforms, but we're bringing that same robust technology to those client connections.
We believe our client app is very good. Our SAT scores are very high on our internal survey which we do every
year. But now we're connecting all that power of those apps to their clients so that their integration is much closer
as well as rolling out many things. We've been on this journey for 10 years and going from being having good
technology to – all of our recruits tell us from other firms as from an advisor desktop leading technology. So that
battle never ends. People are always investing. So you'll see more of it on Investor Day. We believe that's been
one of the impetuses of our strong recruiting and one of the tradeoffs people have made for the packages. It's the
culture and the tools and the support from a marketing department and all the other things we do to help advisors
build their businesses.

Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Hi, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So I wanted to start off with a question just on the securities growth or at least your appetite to maybe grow the
securities portfolio a bit more. You cited the significant buildup in client cash that had clearly impacted the NIM
and was hoping you can just give some context as to what your appetite is to reaccelerate securities growth once
again. And Paul, you cited reinvestment headwinds versus the back book yield. Where are you reinvesting today
just given some of the recent steepening in the curve?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Hey, Steve, great question. We have a significant appetite to grow the securities portfolio. Yeah, unfortunately,
the supply and kind of shorter duration paper we have been buying – trying to buy in that three-year type duration
average life range and the supply given the flat yield curve and where mortgages are being originated today and
the longer end of the curve, there's just not a lot of paper out there that gives you that three-year average life. And
to the extent that you can find it is probably paying in the kind of 80-basis-point range.
So we have been proactive in investing and growing that part of the portfolio. The challenge is where most of the
supply is, you're having to go out 4.5 years, kind of 5 years as on average life and you get paid more obviously,
you're going to get somewhere north of 1%, but you're certainly not getting paid enough to take any level of
inflation risk over that five-year period for example and so we're looking at it closely, almost daily. We're looking at
what's happening with spreads on the securities portfolio. We have a lot of significant appetite to grow it over time.
But I'd tell you now with the Fed buying as much as they're buying particularly on the short end, there's just not a
lot – I mean there's a whole lot more demand than supply, and so we're going to continue to be patient just as we
always are.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
But we've also, I think, strategically in our C&I portfolio grown and also look as alternatives of very high rated
company paper with shorter duration, buying loans in the secondary market where that duration is going to go out
just a few years and it's floating and we think better credit risk/return. So we've been trying to be flexible in
growing it, but we've waited a long time on a floating rate environment. We don't want to lock in at the bottom. So
we're watching duration very, very closely.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks for all that color. And just for my follow-up on – question just on the non-comps, non-comps ex provision
$309 million was certainly better than what we were contemplating. And it's been running in a pretty tight band of
about $305 million to $310 million. I know that it's certainly been helped by depressed business development
expense. But how should we be thinking about the right run rate from here assuming that that's going to remain
relatively depressed? And I guess as we start to prepare for some normalization in business, how should we be
thinking about the run rate in a more normal backdrop as well?

Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Great, question. And business development expense as I said on the opening remarks, we do expect that
to start increasing as travel is starting to pick up a bit maybe not so much in the third quarter, but in the fourth
quarter assuming the vaccines continue to prove effective, we expect the travel and even conferences and
recognition trips to pick back up. Before the COVID pandemic, we said that we were looking to average
somewhere around $325 million a quarter and if you add – if you kind of "normalize" for business development
and I'm not sure what normal is frankly when we do get back to normal, it would get you right around that range.
So we have been really focused on managing all the controllable aspects of non-compensation expenses as you
can see. But also a lot of it's growth driven, I mean so sub-advisory fees is going to grow with fee-based assets
over time. We have FDIC insurance premiums that grow with the bank's balance sheet growth. Recruiting, as
Paul said, is picking up substantially. There's going to be account transfer fees there. So a lot of the non-comp
expense growth as we are a growth company are intended to grow over time, but we are focused on growing
revenues at a faster rate than expenses over time as well, so we do realize that operating leverage.

Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a question on cash balances. They keep growing, we saw how active your clients
were on the brokerage side, but yet cash balances keep growing. Are we starting to see some leveling off or
maybe even putting that to work recently or is it still sort of expect cash balances to keep growing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Great question, Jim. It seems like we've seen a leveling off to some extent. Some of the growth frankly in the last
few months had been just coming from what used to be in purchase money market funds or other short-term
alternatives that are now – because those alternatives aren't generating any kind of yield, they're sitting in the
cash sweep program. But we have seen a little bit of a level off, but those balances as we saw last year in March
can change dramatically with market volatility or downward trend in the market. So at 6.5% of assets, I would tell
you clients are – I think right now we're looking at around 60% exposure to equities which when you look
historically, clients are pretty engaged in the equity markets which is what you would want given the run that we
had and a lot of the value that financial advisors provide is keeping clients consistent with their financial plans in
periods like we had last year. So, for us, we don't tend to see the exposure to the different asset segments that
the e-brokers might see, et cetera, or the day traders might see. We tend to stay a lot more consistent – our
clients tend to stay a lot more consistent as their advisors really keep them on their financial plans.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Right. Okay. That's helpful. And maybe on Carillon Towers, I think you guys noted significant inflows. We haven't
seen that in a while. Just any more specifics on what the drivers were, do you think that can continue, just sort of
any color there?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
Yeah. It was around $1 billion for the quarter of net inflows. So that was a pretty, I think, 8% annualized rate. But
unfortunately, we're not prepared to annualize that. There's structural headwinds. We had some nice institutional
wins during the quarter. And so we have invested in the distribution capability. We recently announced a new
leader for that business. So it'll be good to bring in a fresh set of eyes with a very experienced leader, but still
dealing with the headwinds, so we're not prepared to declare victory after one quarter of net inflows. But it was
certainly nice to see after several quarters of headwinds.
