Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
Phillip D. Green
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, A.B. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are here to review second quarter results
and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, is going to provide some additional comments before we open it up
to your questions.
And in the second quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $160.4 million or $2.47 per share, compared with earnings of
$117.4 million or $1.81 a share reported in the same quarter last year. That represents a 36.6% increase over last
year's level. Our return on average assets and average common equity in the second quarter were 1.30% and
19.36%, respectively, and that compares with 0.92% and 13.88% for the same period last year. Once again, I'm
proud of the solid performance turned in by our outstanding staff in this unusual economic environment.
The continued rate increases by the Federal Reserve and their fight against inflation have had their intended
effect by slowing some segments of the market. In addition, increasing rates continue to raise the opportunity cost
for businesses holding cash in liquid deposits. These impacts are to be expected through the rate cycle and will
continue to play themselves out during this period and Jerry will provide some great insight into their near-term
effects.
As we said last time, during the second quarter, Cullen/Frost did not take on any Federal Home Loan Bank
advances, participate in any special liquidity facility or government borrowing, access any brokered deposits, or
utilize any reciprocal insurance arrangements to build insured deposit percentages. But notwithstanding all that,
we believe the most important thing for us to focus on at this time is that we are successfully executing our
mission to grow and prosper, building long-term relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards
and safe sound assets. And I believe the results for this quarter show we are doing just that and I am excited
about our prospects. And let me give you a few examples.
Looking at our commercial and private banking business, we had the best quarter ever for new customer
relationships, which were up 33% from last year and were up 53% from the previous quarter. That was 1,145 new
relationships. I think it's also significant that almost half of those new relationships, 45%, came from the largest
banks we affectionally know as too big to fail.
Now, I normally wouldn't go into this level of detail, but I'm going to read to you the unannualized linked quarter
growth rates in new relationships by region because I think it's fascinating and tells me that it's not an isolated
occurrence in one specific market. Houston led all regions with 333 net new relationships, which was up 63%
from the previous quarter. Dallas produced 262 net new relationships, which was up 32%. San Antonio produced
172 net new relationships, which was up 107%. Fort Worth produced 156 net new relationships, which was up
20%, Austin produced 117 net new relationships, which was up 102%. The Gulf Coast and Victoria regions
produced 68 net new relationships, which is up by 48%, and the Permian Basin produced 37 net new
relationships, which was up by 28%. Remember, these numbers are not annualized. To me, this says that we are
winning competitively.
Looking at our commercial lending business, we saw an increase in activity related to new opportunities up 19%
and an increase in our probability weighted pipeline by 27% from the first quarter. So we're seeing deal flow. In
fact, we looked at 20% more deals than the first quarter. But that said, booked deals were down 8% because we
declined more and more deals were withdrawn by the customer. We're obviously being more careful in this
environment, but I think the increases in opportunities is notable.

I'll also say that unlike the previous quarter, we saw more opportunities from our customers than prospects.
Prospect opportunities were up 7% for the first quarter – from the first quarter, but customers were up 34%.
Looking at our consumer business, in the second quarter, we set an all-time high for net new relationships at
8,529. This beat our previous all-time high, which was achieved in the first quarter by an unannualized 6%. Our
Houston market, where we have the most mature expansion effort, leads the way here with 2,600 net new
relationships, while Dallas and San Antonio produced about 1,500 each. Consumer loans ended the quarter at
$2.6 billion, a 27% increase from the second quarter of last year, and continues to be driven by consumer real
estate as our home improvement and home equity products continue to provide the right product at the right time
for customers with low rate mortgages and great credit scores.
Included in those numbers were over $12 million in mortgage loans as a part of our measured rollout of this
product, beginning in the Dallas market. Toward the end of the second quarter, we announced our upcoming
expansion into the Austin region, which will build upon the momentum from our Houston and Dallas expansions.
We plan to double the number of locations we have in the Austin area from 17 to 34. Austin is Texas' third largest
deposit market and we already ranked fourth in deposit share. These locations will have a strong legacy to build
on.
Our Houston expansion, including the 25 original locations, plus the additional ones which we call Houston 2.0,
the most recent of which just opened in Friendswood last week. Our expansion branches there are at 121% of
household goal, 164% of our loan goal, and 108% of our deposit goal. Expansion in Houston now represents
$1.27 billion in deposits and about $850 million in loans.
For our Dallas expansion, although it's early, we stand at 226% of new household goal, 315% of our loan goal,
377% of our deposit goal. Expansion in Dallas currently represents $261 million in deposits and $217 million in
loans. So all told, we have about $1.5 billion in deposits from the expansion and about $1 billion, a little over $1
billion in loans.
Credit quality continues to be good by historical standards. Problem loans, which we define as risk grade 10 or
higher totaled $441 million at the end of the second quarter, and that's up from $348 million at the end of the first
quarter and $429 million from this time last year. Non-performing loans totaled $68.5 million at the end of the
second quarter, compared with $39.1 million at the end of the first quarter, the result of two credits. And the
second quarter figure represents just 39 basis points of total loans and 14 basis points of total assets.
Net charge offs for the second quarter were $9.8 million, up from $8.8 million at the end of the first quarter. And
annualized net charge offs for the second quarter represented 22 basis points of average loans. And year-to-date,
charge offs are 21 basis points of loans, which is below our historic average.
Regarding commercial real estate, our overall portfolio remains stable with steady operating performance across
asset types and acceptable debt service coverage ratios and loan to values. Within this portfolio, what we'd
consider to be the major categories of investor CRE, they're comprised, for example, of office, multi-family, retail
and industrial and as examples. We totaled $3.5 billion of outstandings are about 40% of commercial real estate
loans outstanding in total. Our investor commercial real estate portfolio has held up well, exhibiting an overall
average loan to value of about 54% and loan to cost of about 60% and acceptable reported debt service coverage
ratios.
Our interest rates have certainly led to some decline in coverage ratios compared to original underwriting
performance, but we've actually seen some improvement in coverage ratios quarter-over-quarter for the already
4


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
stabilized properties in our portfolio. For example, 85% of our investor office portfolio is stabilized and average
debt service coverage ratios increased from 1.38 to 1.42 this quarter. And we saw a similar trend in the stabilized
portion of the multi-family portfolio.
The investor office portfolio, which is still top of mind, was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter with $927 million
outstanding. It exhibited an average loan to value of 52% and an average debt service coverage ratio of 1.42 at
current interest rates, starting from strong position with a cushion for potential value declines. Our comfort level
with the office portfolio continues to be based on the character and experience of our borrowers and sponsors.
The predominantly Class A nature of our office buildings and the fact that 85% of the exposure is associated with
stabilized well-performing projects. It also helps to be operating in Texas.
We did have an $18 million office building loan that we've been watching migrate to non-accrual during the
quarter. But overall, the office portfolio and really entire investor CRE portfolio did not experiencing identification
of anything material in terms of weak or underperforming credits or projects that we were not already watching.
So to conclude, as I said earlier, I'm proud of our performance and what our bankers have been able to
accomplish, as well as the competitive success we continue to exhibit in our markets. And now I'll turn the call
over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, for some additional comments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. I wanted to start off first by talking a little bit about our Houston 1.0 expansion results. As a
reminder, the last of those branches was opened in 2021. So these branches are still in what I call the
development stage. As Phil mentioned, we've been very pleased with the volumes we've been able to achieve.
Looking at the second quarter, linked-quarter annualized growth in average balances for these locations was 31%
for deposits and 17% for loans. And for the second quarter, Houston 1.0 contributed $0.05 to our quarterly
earnings per share.
Now moving to our net interest margin. Our net interest margin percentage for the second quarter was 3.45%,
down 2 basis points from the 3.47% reported last quarter. The decrease included some positives that were more
than offset by some negatives. On the positive side, higher yields on loans and balances at the Fed, combined
with higher loan volumes, were more than offset by higher cost of deposits and customer repos and lower deposit
levels at the Fed compared to the first quarter. Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio
averaged $21.3 billion during the second quarter, down $466 million from the first quarter. During the quarter, we
did not make any material investment purchases.
During the quarter we sold about $360 million in municipal securities, as we took advantage of market
dislocations, which allowed us to improve interest income going forward. We've recognized a net gain of about
$33,000 on those transactions. The net unrealized loss on the available-for-sale portfolio at the end of the quarter
was $1.61 billion, an increase of $207 million from the $1.4 billion reported at the end of the first quarter. The net
unrealized loss on the held-to-maturity portfolio at the end of the quarter was $148 million, up $37 million from the
first quarter. The taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio in the second quarter was 3.24%, flat
with the first quarter. The taxable portfolio, which averaged $13.8 billion, up approximately $439 million from the
prior quarter had a yield of 2.71%, up 4 basis points from the prior quarter.
Our tax-exempt municipal portfolio averaged about $7.5 billion during the second quarter, down about $905
million from the first quarter and had a taxable equivalent yield of 4.27%, up 4 basis points from the prior quarter.
At the end of the second quarter, approximately 72% of the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF insured.

The duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the second quarter was 5.2 years, down from 5.5 years at
the end of the first quarter.
Looking at deposits, on a linked-quarter basis, average deposits were down $1.8 billion or 4.1%, with about 80%
of the decrease coming from non-interest bearing deposits. I want to talk a little bit more about our non-interest
bearing deposits, which totaled $14.9 billion at the end of the quarter, with 96% of that amount being commercial
demand deposits. During the individual months of the second quarter, we did see the average balance in the non-
interest bearing accounts began to stabilize.
During last quarter's call, we said that we expected deposits to continue to decline, as this has historically been
our seasonal trend that deposits peak in the fourth quarter and reach their low in the second quarter before
beginning to grow in the second half of the year. I also noted that April non-interest bearing deposits were down
$492 million from March and that we expected that April average to decline, given the anticipated impact of
seasonality, including tax payments. April non-interest bearing balances decreased $587 million from March,
almost $100 million more on average than at the time of our call. These average balances then decreased $441
million in May, with the average affected by tax payments in April and then decreased $108 million in June. And
month-to-date through yesterday, July average balances are down $202 million from the June average.
The June and July average balances have seen the pace of outflow began to slow down and we are anticipating
that slower pace of outflows to continue. But with interest rates at these levels, there continues to be uncertainty
with these customer balances. Customers have attractive risk reward options in this rate cycle that didn't
necessarily present themselves in the last cycle, which provides them with multiple options for the utilization of
these funds.
Looking at total interest-bearing deposits, they've been relatively stable during the period. Average interest-
bearing deposits were $25.8 billion during the quarter, down $345 million or 1.3% from the first quarter. We do
continue to see a shift in the mix to higher cost CDs from the lower cost savings, IOC and MMA. The cost of
interest-bearing deposits in the second quarter was 1.87%, up 35 basis points from 1.52% in the first quarter.
Customer repos for the second quarter averaged $3.7 billion, down $492 million from the $4.2 billion average in
the first quarter as we saw some flows out of our repo product, including for tax payments during the quarter. The
cost of customer repos for the quarter was 3.52%, up 32 basis points from the first quarter.
Looking at non-interest income on a linked-quarter basis, I just wanted to point out a couple of items. Trust and
investment management fees were up $3.2 million or 9%, compared to the first quarter, driven by increases in
estate fees of $1.6 million, real estate fees of $751,000, and investment fees of $463,000. Estate fees and real
estate fees can fluctuate based on the number of estates settled or property sold respectively. Insurance
commissions and fees were down $6 million or 32% from the first quarter, driven by lower P&C contingent
bonuses down $3.1 million benefit commissions down $4.8 million, and life commissions down $867,000. Partly
offsetting these unfavorable variances was a $3 million increase in P&C Commissions when compared to the first
quarter. As a reminder, the first quarter is typically our strongest quarter for insurance revenues, given we
typically recognize contingent income in that quarter and are also impacted by our natural business cycle. The
second quarter is typically our weakest quarter for insurance revenues, again impacted by our normal renewal
business volumes.
Looking at our projection of full year 2023 total non-interest expenses, as I mentioned last quarter, we currently
expect total non-interest expense for the full year 2023 to increase at a percentage rate in the mid-teens over our
2022 reported levels. This does not include the potential impact of the FDIC special assessment, which has not
yet been finalized. The effective tax rate for the first six months of the year was 16% or about 16.2%, excluding
6


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
discrete items. Our current expectation is that our full-year effective tax rate for 2023 should approximate 16%,
but that can be affected by discrete items during the rest of the year.
Regarding our stock buyback, I want to mention that during the second quarter, we utilized about $28 million of
our $100 million approved share repurchase to buyback, approximately 280,000 shares at an average price of
$96.02. Regarding the estimate for full-year 2023 earnings, our current projections don't include any additional
changes to the Fed funds rate through the rest of 2023, given that rate assumption and our expectation of 2023,
non-interest expense growth of mid-teens, which does not include the impact of the FDIC special assessment.
We currently believe that the current mean of analyst estimates of $9.63 is a little high.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

Hey Brady.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So your net interest margin has held in very well, especially relative to the industry which saw NIM slippage by a
decent amount this quarter for most of your peers. Do you expect the net interest margin to continue to hold in
relatively well, or do you think that at some point you will see some real downside there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
What I'd say, Brady, I thought that, last quarter I said it was going to be relatively stable. I think, I'd stick with that,
except that I would say that there's a downward bias. As you know, when I talked about the 2 basis point
decrease that we had between the first and the second quarter, all those are positive and negatives are still, kind
7


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
of affecting us going forward. So, I'd say kind of stable, but again, we're probably more towards a little bit negative
bias, but I don't see it changing significantly or not based on anything I'm seeing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, I know in the past, you guys have talked about some of the financial impacts of expanding into a
new market like Austin. I don't think they've moved the numbers a ton. But any guess on the financial impact of
the Austin expansion over the next year or two?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Brady we'll talk about that in January. We really would give some guidance and obviously it's going to be primarily
expense based at the beginning, as you know, as we start putting those locations together. I don't expect for 2023
that they'll have a significant impact. So any impact we'll start feeling next year and we'll kind of give some color at
the beginning of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I'd just might add, Brady that just the scope of it's a little bit smaller just by its nature than Dallas or
Houston. The expansions that we've had there. So, pound for pound, it'll be about the same, but the scope of it's
just a little bit smaller.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then finally for me, NPAs are off. They're still at a very low level. But I think I heard you mention two
credits moved into the NPA bucket. One was a $18 million office loan. What was the other NPA that went into that
bucket this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, it was in the pre-owned auto sale dealership and the higher interest rates really impacted its carry costs
and also the performance of some of the paper that it carries. And so we thought it was appropriate to recognize
that. So it wasn't real estate related, but it was in the automobiles area.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey Steve.

Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I want to start – so on the non-interest bearing deposits last quarter, you guys thought it would come down in 2Q
and then stabilize and we're seeing continued outflows. I'm just curious, what's taking customers so long to just
reach that amount of operating cash that they need? I find it, hard to believe with every move, they're like digging
deeper and deeper. I would have thought it would pretty much be done by now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think Steven it's – as I've said in my comments, I think the rate environment that we're in is so unique and so
different. There's a lot more opportunities for them to invest that money. It's – and really impressive rates and so
even though I said, that in my mind, a couple of hundred million is certainly better than the $500 million and $600
million decreases that we were seeing. But I do think that there continues to be volatility there. I think there's just
too many options for them to utilize that those funds, whether it's to pay off any debt that they might have or
decide to invest it. And investment could certainly be and we've seen some dollars obviously flow into our off-
balance sheet, either trust areas or treasury areas.
So I think, now I'm with you. I kind of thought most of it was gone, but I think in the environment, we're going to
continue to see some pressure there. I think the upside for us is, as Phil mentioned, we really feel very positive
about all the new relationships that we're bringing in. We're – see some pretty impressive deposit wins and in
some cases, those commercial wins take a little bit longer to get on the books and get them closed. But, I think in
this rate environment, we're just going to continue to be cautious. And, I think everybody is going to have to make
the decision on how they want to invest those funds. And all we can really do is to continue to focus on growing
the business and adding new customers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then on the balance sheet, you guys had good loan growth in the quarter, more or less funded with
securities, if you just look at the movements on the asset side. As we think about the back half, Jerry, as maybe
these non-interest bearing outflows subside a bit, do you think we'll see net balance sheet growth in the second
half or will you just continue to fund loan growth with other assets at runoff?

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think that, we're projecting some small growth on the funding side at this point. Nothing really material. Again,
given the uncertainty that we've got on the commercial side, our projections are really do have some growth, but
it's not anything that I would say is significant.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, thanks. And then final one. So, Phil, I appreciate all the line items that you ran through by market in terms
of customers that you guys are picking up. I'm curious, so your service is consistently good, peers are consistently
not as good. What is it about this environment that you're seeing so many customers move banks? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, Mr. Steven, I think it's a couple of things primarily. When you look at our movement in terms of growth in
new relationships, the expansion no doubt has a really big effect on that. And I think it's really paying off in terms
of growing those relationships overall. We've also been spending more and focused more on marketing. I think,
we're doing a better job on marketing and then reputationally, just to be honest, we've got a great reputation and
reputation for great service. So it's been pretty exciting as we've moved into some of these markets. Some cases
we want – I was thinking about one we opened up in, I think, it's Dallas just recently. I think our, the closest Frost
bank was 15 miles away and the growth has just been tremendous.
So it's – I think it's really simple. I think we are investing in our business. We're growing our distribution in fantastic
markets. We've got a great value proposition for service. And it's just and we're marketing and investing in
marketing and technology. I think, it's just all working together to win. And I apologize for giving so much
granularity on that. But it just shows that that's really what we're focused on is new relationships. It's part of our
mission statement that's called out. And we're going to go through rate cycles up and down. And, we're going to
see movements of non-interest bearing deposits out and all that stuff that's going to happen. But if we just focus
on growing the business, growing the relationships in great markets, we're going to do fine.

Just going back to your EPS outlook comment for 2023. I know you mentioned the stable NIM with a downward
bias so that, that was helpful to hear. Was just wondering how you're expecting that to translate into NII trends for
the back half of the year at this point. Are you thinking to [ph] stabilized NIM (00:31:55) and stable funding what
you just mentioned would get you to [ph] stabilized NII (00:32:01) or how are you thinking about that at this point
as you look at your EPS outlook?

Yeah, I guess the thing that I would focus on is, is kind of where we ended the quarter on the deposit side. I
mentioned to Steven that we're not projecting a whole lot of growth from there for the rest of the year. And so
that's obviously will have some impact on net interest income. So, I think that's really where the pressure is.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. And then regarding deposit trends, you said earlier it sounded like [ph] you're baking in (00:32:36) marginal
deposit growth or marginal funding growth, I guess, in the back half. Are you assuming that DDA continues to
decline through that period as well? I know you mentioned that the runoff has subsided a bit, but is that the
general expectation now you continue to have mix shift through the end of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. And again, we're projecting growth. But I think that on an annualized basis, I think, we're at 2% or
something like that that we're projecting. What's interesting is 1% of that is our legacy bank and 1% is coming
from our expansion. So obviously, they're having an impact on our growth. But that aside, I think that gives you
some perspective on the size of the deposit side that we're projecting. And I think, the mix I would expect that it's
probably will not change a whole lot. But if there is a movement, I would expect that pressure continues to be
more on the non-interest-bearing side than on the interest-bearing side. And on the interest-bearing side, I think
we're starting to see some settlement there on rates. But with this rate hike, we'll actually – obviously react to that.
But I think, you'll still see some movement of mix. But it appears everything's stabilizing, certainly a lot more than
we saw just a quarter ago.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Okay. And then just given where we are in the rate cycle, have you guys been reducing asset sensitivity at
all in the past quarter or do you have any plans to do that in the back half of the year, just with swaps or anything
else?

I think right now we're really kind of sitting tight. We're obviously looking at a lot of opportunities and things that
we can do. But at this point, I wouldn't envision that we're doing anything very drastic. Obviously, asset sensitivity
is diminishing as the balances that we're holding at the Fed are diminishing as we're seeing that the decreases in
non-interest-bearing deposits. But other than that, not doing anything actively.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q

Okay. And then maybe just one last one on expenses. I appreciated the reiterated guide there. It seems like just
given where we are in the first half, you're looking for a pretty deep ramp-up in the second half. Is that kind of
what you guys are looking at this point? Is that likely to see that kind of a ramp-up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, that's kind of what we're saying. We obviously review our projections monthly and talking to our lines of
business. And, everything that we're seeing certainly is pointing us in that direction.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the liquidity and the cash balance in the quarter. I know the average
was about $7 billion, which was, I think, sort of in-line with where you had indicated balances were back in April.
So is it fair to say that you didn't utilize any of that through the quarter? And now that the environment has
stabilized, do you plan to continue or would you use cash to support loan growth and deposit outflow or just given
where Fed rates are, does it sort of make sense to keep cash at 5% and continue to let the securities level come
down?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, that's really where we are right now. I think that's the sort of guidance we gave last quarter. And you heard
me say we didn't make any investment purchases. I think at this point, any decrease that we've seen in the cash
balances at the Fed and I think we were at the end of the quarter, we were down to $6.3 billion, a little under 16%
of our deposit balances. So at this point, I think we're pretty comfortable with that. As you said, looking at the [ph]
$540 million (00:36:23) that we're earning now, we're not looking to make any active moves on the investment
portfolio at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

I think for the rest of the year, I think we're at $720 million, say $715 million with really $250 million of it, a third of
it, say a little bit more in the third on the last day of the month. So the last part of 2023, the second half of 2023 is
what I'd call a normal amount. As we look at 2024, we're probably talking something in the neighborhood of $3
billion for the year.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. I was curious, what's the outlook for the deposit beta? I think the original forecast was 32%. And then
secondly, do think that there'll be pressure on this deposit beta next year as we're in kind of a higher for longer
rate environment. And your interest rates on deposits are a little bit lower than peers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Our cumulative beta through on interest bearing deposits through the second quarter was 37%, up from 33% in
the first quarter. On total deposits, that translates to 23% at the end of the second quarter versus 20%. I would
expect that we would go up to somewhere by the end of the year, say in the 39% given this last rate hike that
we're dealing with. I think, that's comparable to what we've looked at, what we've done historically, say the
average of the last two cycles. So, but looking at 2024, not really in this environment, not expecting, Peter, that
we'd have to do much again. It'll be interesting to see where we're at come January and what our expectations
are. But I don't envision, we've kept up with deposit pricing and tried to be fair and obviously have gone out early
to provide our customers with a fair deal.
So I don't expect that once if the Fed has stopped hiking, I don't expect that we're going to have to do a lot of
continuing to increase our betas, if you will, or increase our deposit rates after the hikes stop. So no, I don't really
expect much change. We'll have to see obviously. We're going to want to make sure that we continue to be
competitive with our peers. That's the one thing that we want to make sure. But at this point, if I had a crystal ball,
I'm not seeing a lot of pressure there at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And then I just want to ask, big picture, I'm just a little bit surprised that maybe the deposit outlook is not a
little bit stronger. I mean, I realize what the environment is like, but every quarter you guys keep having this record
new account growth both on the commercial bank, the consumer bank, the success with the branch build out

expansion, and that's starting to take hold. I'm just wondering why the deposit outlook is just not a little bit
stronger with all this growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, I think one thing, Peter, is that, that we need to consider as we answer the question, [ph] I can't say
(00:39:48) from a broad perspective – I can't say exactly why, but one thing I can say is that, we tend to have a lot
more operational, transactional accounts, demand deposit accounts, checking accounts than peers. And I think
those are more susceptible to opportunities that Jerry has talked about. So I think we got to work our way through
that. And then I think once we touch bottom, you'll get to see movement up. I'm confident that we're going to see
traction from these new relationships.
One thing we saw early in the Houston expansion was that when we looked at our performance versus goal on
deposits, we were better on relationships, but we were under our goal in commercial deposits as far as balance.
And one thing that we learned was getting the relationship is one thing, but they've got to – and this on the
commercial side, you've got to go through getting your customers to send their payments to a different place.
There's just a lot of operational things that have to happen before you as a business see the full effect of being
the primary checking account take place. And so I think that's part of it. And – but what we've seen is as we've
grown relationships historically, we'll see more and more of that company's business go through there and I'm
confident we're going to see that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Thanks for that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Remember, we don't count a relationship unless we get the primary checking account. We'll do business with
people. We get different aspects of their business. But you don't get to count it as a relationship unless you get
the primary checking account.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So, I wanted to talk about the [ph] $80 million (00:42:12) office loan and could you please provide us with some
details as far as what potentially makes that loan or property different from the rest of your office CRE portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Okay. Well, in the case of this one particular asset, it's one that lost a major tenant. And it was one that is a newer
relationship for us and that it came on right before COVID came over, I think is in January of 2020. And so there's
not that same type of history, a good reputational group, but not the same kind of history with us. And as they lost
that tenant and then their debt service coverage numbers suffered as a result, we felt like they needed to right-
size it to a certain extent. They didn't agree with it and they were willing to do a smaller amount. So it's been
restructured and it's got – it'll perform for the next year, but not to the level that we think it should. And so we've
got that on a non-accrual. And it was basically you just had a disagreement between the parties on what they
should do as far as rightsizing the project. In terms of the asset itself, it is an office building loan, but we booked it
at the amount of the underlying real estate and it is a tremendous piece of real estate in a very dynamic area of
Houston. And so, I'm not concerned about valuation losses of any significance, but because of where we are,
because it does cash flow to the place that we feel it needs to be, we put it on non-accrual.
And as far as what's different, I mean, look rates are higher and we've got a tremendous amount of projects and
they're not all going to be perfect. And you could end up – I think we've talked before, maybe as I recall, you could
have a property that is an industrial property with a Fortune 500 credit tenant, long-term leased and underwritten
before COVID or the current increases in rates. It looks great, right? But the present value of that lease stream
today is less. And so equity suffers in the project and those types of things. And they've got to get worked out and
we'll just see how it work out. Do we think there'll be significant impact on loss? No, but we're watching credits
that look like that. You might have a senior housing property that is kind of a different deal, but I mean, again, this
is the lending business, there're all kinds of things that happen. And so it's a risk business. But, there are lots of
properties that are being impacted. And the main thing that we're doing is we're relying on the underwriting that
we did [indiscernible] (00:45:27) and the people that are backing it up, the vast majority of which have been long-
term customers.
So, we're going to see some dislocation here and there, sure we are. But, do things look good today on a
historical basis and are we happy with the underwriting that we've done over time? I am. And we'll just see how it
goes out over the cycle.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got it. Very helpful. And then my follow-up question is on the share repurchases during the quarter. Just kind of
what led to that decision and what kind of appetite do you have for the rest of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
We really just – at the price, like I said, we were at $96 and we just thought it was a deal that we really couldn't
pass up. Obviously, we didn't spend all of it. We just thought given where the price was, we thought it was a great
value for us and we took advantage of that. At this point out, we'll be opportunistic. We'll just – if something like
that happens again, we may take advantage, but at this point, nothing planned.

I was hoping to follow up just on the on the securities question. I just wanted to confirm what you said that it was
$750 million. Was that through the rest of the year with the large chunk at the like-on-like 12/31 and then $3 billion
next year? Am I hearing that correctly?

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I can tell you something right off the top of my head, we bought $1 billion. We talked about this – we bought $1
billion in treasury securities two years ago, I guess a year and a half now when there was conversation about
Russia invading Ukraine. And we could – we made that purchase as a defensive posture. Obviously, I wouldn't
make it – wouldn't have made it, we today. We did that at 1% so that first $250 million comes off at the end of the
year and it's at 1% – 1.02% I think it is. And then the next $750 million of that – those proceeds come in within the
first few weeks of January. Again, at that same 1.02%.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And I think you said earlier that you weren't being too aggressive on new purchases, but in terms of
adding to the size of the book. But is it safe to assume that you would look to replace, that $3.75 billion over the
next 18 months? Would you just look to kind of replace that or are you trying to move the size of the securities
portfolio lower?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think all things being equal and by that, again, we're talking about deposits a lot today and assuming that we've
reached some sort of stabilization and start to grow, I think the quick response would be, yeah, we would look to
replace it. But I think until we get to that point in time, we'll have to see what else is going on on the balance sheet
and make our decision at that point. But obviously that could be a great positive or will be a great positive impact
to NIM and to net interest income in 2024. Just even if we kept it at the Fed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And is there any bias towards any type of security? I know you have a lot of the [ph] community (00:49:16)
bonds in Texas. I just didn't know if you would look to kind of replace treasury with treasury or, it was anything
more complex than that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I think we would really evaluate at that point with our investment committee what made sense, where we
saw the most value. So we don't have anything that we'd say, oh, we're necessarily going to replace the treasury
with the treasury. We're going to see where we think there's more value – most value in the market.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just a few random ones here. On the credit question, Phil or Jerry, what should we expect on non-performers? I
know these two kind of feel like random and very different credits, but what do you guys see in terms of stress in
the portfolio? And, do we – maybe it's obvious, but do we just expect it to continue to rise.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Jon, I think realistically it will. Some of these – we're watching a lot of credits and we've got good eyes on
everything. And if rates stay up and higher longer I think we'll see some more non-performers and in real estate.
But do I think there's much loss there? No, I don't. And we might get lucky and avoid some of them. But, there's
just some properties that are under stress and I'm a [ph] cross (00:51:04) banker. And so I'm going to take a
conservative view and I think non-performers will increase. But they're so low right now. It's really hard for them to
– for us to expect them to be at the same level, going through a cycle like this, indefinitely. So, I mean, I'm not
trying to paint a bleak picture. I'm just trying to be realistic.
And we're going to have to be patient as we work with these customers. The main thing you want to see is people
doing the right thing that you've banked and working with you and on restructuring deals, doing their part to
contribute to make it right. And, we've got some deals that we're seeing that they're going to need that and we're
having conversations with that. And I'm expecting everyone to perform the way they should. And I think it'll be
fine.
And – but realistically, not everyone is going to do what you want them to do. And I don't have any specific
expectations there, except I've just been in this business a long time. And, some of that's going to happen. That to
me is not the big worry right now. It's – to me, look, and I don't want you think we don't have all eyes on credit. We
do. I mean, but to me, that's going to work its way out. I've got faith in the underwriting and the relationships that
we've been doing for the last few years. Again, it doesn't matter what you do today, really what matters is what
you've done over the last few years. And I've got a lot of faith in that. The thing that I want to see us continuing to
do is win competitively. We are winning competitively. And I'm really excited about the opportunity in Austin. I
think it's got every chance to be as good as we've seen in other places and we'll see. But, that's what we're
focused on, is growing the business and winning competitively. Will we see some non-performers increase, I bet,
we will.

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Let me see if I can grab my – put my hands on some of that information. What was interesting is that and Phil and
I really haven't talked about this, but for the quarter, it was interesting that how well Houston paid their debt. Now,
at this point, they're starting to pay for more of the expansion. It's kind of what we had been talking about when all
this started was, the plan was to make them – to make 1.0 profitable, so they could start paying for some of those.
And I'd say, so, what we said was it takes about 27 months to breakeven is kind of what we kind of project. And
so at this point, I think that Houston 2.0 is probably a couple of years away just from the standpoint that remember
early on, it's all expense loaded. And so at this point, it's still going to be a couple of years before Houston 2.0 is
contributing. It's not the size of 1.0, but, we've got some of that same expense front loading.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And just on 1.0, for it to reach, call it, similar returns and profitability profile of the rest of the company, is
that a year away?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I think that's probably right. We'd kind of have to take a little bit closer look at it, sharpen our pencil, but
yeah, I don't think it's too far from that. Again, I don't have in front of me what their projections are for the rest of
the year. But like we said, they had a 30% [ph] linked (00:55:31) quarter core growth on deposits, with that sort of
a growth horizon we wouldn't be too far. But I have to be honest, I don't have that sort of a projection in front of
me and happy to be able to talk about it at some future point when we get together.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Jon, it's an interesting question. The – just kind of overall, as we look at these branches and we [ph] pro forma it
(00:55:56) out, we tend to use it. When we began all this, a five-year horizon for the branch to kind of reach
maturity, and that was – I guess that would be similar profitability to what we were overall. But honestly, it's also
true, we don't talk a lot about it, but it's also true that in years 6 through 10, I think we've seen really more growth
than we see in that first five years as those things mature, we see some really significant growth.
So I think ultimately, these locations end up with better profitability than the total profitability of the company just
because they're more efficient and more focused on a book of business in a defined market and a defined
structure. So, I think that we're not at five years for all of them and it'll take a little bit even for 1.0 to get there. But
– and then certainly 2.0 is going to take some time before all of those, or five-year mature. But, don't count out
continued growth in those markets from the expansion with year 6 through 10. Historically, as you looked at those
40 branches that we had done, before we started the expansion, some of the growth in years 6 through 10 was
really significant.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
