MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Carlo Pellerani
Group Treasurer & General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the HSBC Fixed Income Call for our Full-Year 2022 results. Thank you for joining
us. I'm Carlo Pellerani, Group Treasurer. And I'm joined by Richard O'Connor, Global Head of Investor Relations;
and Greg Case, Head of the Investor Relations.
As usual, I'll mention a couple of things in the results. Then a quick update on financial resources. And finally,
we'll go into Q&A. I will not be referencing any slide as we go through.
In terms of results, I just would like to mention three points: 9.9% royalty for the year, 1.6% up on the back of
higher NII and good cost control, which more than offset a higher ECL charge. We expect royalty to improve to
about 12% this year.
Second, in terms of balance sheet dynamics, the reported loans and deposit numbers need to be read carefully
because they include adjustments for the Canadian and French sales and FX. So if you exclude those, loans
actually decreased by $25 billion only in the quarter and deposits were flat.
And then finally, credit quality remains quite solid. Full-year ECL charge equivalent to 35 basis points of gross
loans. Stage 3 loans remain low at 2.1% of total loans. And at this stage, we still see limited signs of deterioration
in the loan book. And we are flagging an ECL charge of around 40 basis points for the year.
Now, on to financial resources starting with capital. Our CET1 ratio, as you saw, was 14.2%, which is 80-basis-
point up in the fourth quarter. Thanks to profits and lower adjusted RWAs, we are now inside our CET1 target of
14% to 14.5% and 3.3 percentage points above our NDA requirements.

Second, on liquidity, it remains quite strong, most importantly at the legal entity level, but also reporting 132%
group LCR, with total gross HQLA of over $800 billion. Our loan-to-deposit ratio is quite low at 59%, and hence
we have a meaningful deposit surplus, which positions us quite well in this high rate environment.
Our MREL ratio is at 30.1%, which compares very favorably to our 26.4% requirement. We intend to continue to
operate with a prudent buffer over that minimum.
From a funding perspective, we expect to issue a similar amount of gross debt to the one we issued last year,
targeting $17 billion to $20 billion of HoldCo senior, $4 billion to $5 billion in Tier 2s, and about $2 billion in AT1s.
On legacy capital, good progress in 2022. We reduced the [ph] stack by over (00:02:57) $4 billion. We will
continue to monitor the market for cost-effective options to manage the stack down over time.
So, in summary, a good year, the group now becoming very capital-generative. Our capital funding and liquidity
positions leave us well placed to continue growing, and we believe our business model offers bondholders one of
the most diverse sets of revenue streams in global banking.
On that note, let's open the call for Q&A. I'll hand over to Greg.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Carlo. Hi, everyone. As we did last time, we'll be taking questions over Zoom. If you want to ask a
question, please, can you raise your hand to signal that you want to ask a question? And you'll need to ensure
your line is not muted when we come to you. I'll just give that one a minute to signal for questions, and you can
also ask the question via the chat function.
Yeah. So the first question comes from Lee Street from Citi. Lee, your line should be open. Lee, we can't hear
you. Sorry. [indiscernible] (00:04:21) move on to Dan David from Autonomous.

Good afternoon, all. Hopefully, you can hear me.

Success. Great. Congratulations on the results, and thanks for taking my questions. I have three. Just wanted to
touch upon the AT1 call, the dollar [$], 6.25%. Was this decision taken on an economic basis? You mentioned
before the call that the market wasn't pricing in the risk of extension. And I guess if I look at your spreads today

and also your issuance plan versus your total calls this year, it suggests that it could have been called outright,
similar to what you've done in previous years.
On the legacy, could you just remind us of your priorities, whether anything has changed there? And then just
focusing on the make-wholes, you've talked about economics there in the past as well. I'm just wondering if you
can provide a guide as to what sort of P&L or CET1 impact you'd be willing to book. And I guess I'm looking at the
exercises that you've done so far and kind of thinking of 1 to 2 points that you've kind of paid. Is that reasonable
or should we expect that you can maybe take a larger hit as a result of the need to get rid of [ph] these (00:05:29)
securities?
And then finally, just a quick one on LIBOR, do you intend to use the synthetic extension on your dollar DISCOs
post June 2023? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi there. Thanks very much for the three questions. On the AT1 call, to start, yes, the decisions that we make are
on economic terms. Now the way that those economics are calculated are a little bit more complex than just
calculating the PV of the transactions. So broadly speaking, what we do is we take into account three
components.
One is the PV of a call versus those automatically reaching the full amount. Second, what is the full amount that
we need outstanding and whether we're going to have a period of time or an amount outstanding to replace that
call, which is smaller. And as a consequence, there is a cost of carry that we are avoiding. And third, what is the
impact on the future spreads and the issuance markets? When you put all those things into account, it's a little bit
of an art rather than a full science, we put all those things together and we come up with the results. And you saw
on the back of that that we decided to call the transaction. That's probably all I can say on that one.
In terms of legacy, you might remember from previous calls that I described that I think of these in two
dimensions. There is a dimension which is how complex the securities are from a resolution perspective. And on
the second dimension is what is that call of taking those securities out? So when you put all those two dimensions
together, we ended up with a pecking order that has, broadly speaking, four buckets.
The first bucket is the holding company, [ph] near low (00:07:22) securities. Those are in the first bucket because
they are out of our resolution entity, the holding company. And there is a lack of [ph] contraction (00:07:30) rights
of recognition of the Bank of England [indiscernible] (00:07:35) rights. So those are the first priorities.
Second, we have the [ph] HPE (00:07:41) the non-ring-fenced bank fixed rates Tier 2s. Then we have the
DISCOs and then we have everything else. So as you saw, we progressed along the first two buckets last year.
And those buckets continue to be the most important, and will progress down from that priority list.
Third on synthetic LIBOR, all I would say is at this stage, the consultation on synthetic LIBOR hasn't concluded.
So we'll have to wait for that before we can do anything about it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Dan. And so, we've got some questions in from Lee. I'll just read them out, as I think he's having some
trouble joining. So at first, Lee asks a high level question. With all the changes in the business model in recent
years, which banks do we regard as our main peers? Additionally, what's the plan for the $4.3 billion of legacy
4

that loses capital value in 2025? And also linked to that, should we assume that the $4 billion to $5 billion of Tier 2
will be a normal run rate over the next few years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you. Thanks very much, Lee. On the first question, HSBC stands pretty much on its own in the type of
business model that we have. So we don't quite see ourselves having a very comparable peer around the globe.
What we do is we look at each of those markets and we compare ourselves versus more local peers with, of
course, the caveat that the value of our franchise is actually international connectivity. So it's difficult pretty much
to give you a few set of peers that you can compare us against.
In terms of the legacy securities losing value in 2025, what we're doing is we are pre-funding that – those
amounts over the next few years to avoid a big cliff risk in 2025, and that's incorporated into the $4 million to $5
billion that we are flagging for this year for Tier 2. And then on your third question, looking forward, and I would
say this more broadly across all the components of the stack, we are now more or less at a level where the
distribution of the different components of the stack are pretty much where we think they should be. And from this
point, we are about refinancing and financing growth. So if you take the current amount of spending and you
divide and in – I don't know – five- to seven-year average maturity, you end up with an annual amount of
issuance, which is not that dissimilar to what we are doing this year. And that includes also the Tier 2, so
somewhere between, let's say, $3 billion to $5 billion on a stable basis every year.
Richard, do you want to comment anything else, especially on the first question?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Global Head-Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. On the peers, Lee, it's a very good question. And clearly, we can do benchmarking, for example, on UK
ring-fenced bank versus our big peer banks and [ph] we do say – saying that we'll achieve it then. Saying this with
friends (00:10:51) in China and obviously in our home market, Hong Kong, versus other large Hong Kong banks.
But the short answer is at the group level, there's no one [indiscernible] (00:11:04) there's no one sort of a direct
or totally direct peers in trade.
We've obviously got three or four banks who are also global, but are much smaller than us, we're double size, [ph]
we're (00:11:17) number two. For example in transaction banking, it's basically us and Citi. And then you go down
to peers who are a lot smaller than us. [ph] You won't see it yet (00:11:27) but just so you you're aware, the peer
group for [indiscernible] (00:11:30) purposes has changed this year and there are more Asian peers within it. So
we have made a few changes to the peer group to basically make it more Asian-centric as the center of gravity for
the bank and moves more to Asia. So that's one account. Do you want to have a look at that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Sure. One last piece of Lee's question. So he also asks, as it relates to securities with LIBOR-based
coupons, should we be expecting LIBOR consent solicitations to be announced by June 30?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, Lee, as we have said before, we have no intention of leaving investors with LIBOR risk without before offering
them a modern alternative. That is, of course, depending security by security when that impacts you. In the case

of the discos specifically, there is a more – a closer timeframe for us to look at that. So you should expect
something imminent from us in terms of offering remediation for those. The form of that offering is still under
discussion. We haven't concluded what is. But you should expect something imminent in that regard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks for your question, Lee. The next question is coming from Rob Smalley from UBS. Rob, your line should
now be open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and doing the call. First, on net interest margin developments. We've seen –
and you're projecting continued strong growth in the margin even with a 50% pass-through of an increase in rates.
Could you talk about the development, particularly Hong Kong versus the UK? I think that some of your peers in
the UK are seeing peak net interest margin now. And where are you seeing growth in yours? That's the first
question.
Second, UK-related again, you have a lot of liquidity at the bank. Any other plans to deploy it in any other way? I
know that the easy answer is if we could, we would have already. But anything that changed there? And then
finally, on the ECL charge, $600 million for Mainland China; $800 million for the rest of the book. Could you talk
about the methodology there, whether there's more – whether there's idiosyncratic risks in there, how much of
that is model-driven and how you came to that number? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks. Thanks, Rob. Thanks for the questions. So let's start with NII. So as you saw, we had NII for Q4 of $9.6
billion. If you annualize that number, it gives you about $38 billion of NII. We had a lot of questions earlier today
as to what should be our guidance of NII for the full year. And what we have said is we haven't changed our
guidance. What we are saying is that we are flagging more than $36 billion of NII for 2023.
The way we think about it is there are a few tailwinds and there are a few headwinds. On the tailwind side, we
have still a component of the rates that haven't repriced – the rates that we have seen so far that haven't repriced
yet in our books, so that's a tailwind. There are some potential additional rate moves that are still in the tailwind,
and FX calculations gives us about $0.5 billion upside versus when we flagged that more than $36 billion.
Conversely, there are a few headwinds. The headwinds are potential increases in pass-throughs. Our pass-
through so far have been inside the 50% long-term averages. We're expecting from this point on the pass-
throughs to start to become closer to 50% which implies more than 50% from this point on. An additional tailwind
– an additional headwind is also on the migrations of clients from savings accounts to time deposit. That is
particularly relevant in the Hong Kong market, which is extremely competitive, much less so in the UK market. So
when you put all things together, we end up with a guidance that we provide, at least $36 billion and more than
$36 billion for the year.
In terms of the UK, the UK market is – they're starting to see some sign of competition in the UK market but is still
far from what we see in Hong Kong. So at the moment, we're quite confident with the guidance that we have
given.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 21-Feb-2023
In terms of liquidity, indeed, we are a bank that ends up having a lot of liquidity. What we have done over the last
few years is we have become very deliberate about our liquidity management, which clearly is helping us in this
off cycle, having surplus liquidity in this increasing rates environment is a competitive advantage. But broadly
speaking, we created a framework to look at surplus liquidity in each of the entities that looks at what the liquidity
should be and then we look at what the surplus in each of the entities is. And then, we lay out a framework that
looks at how we deploy that liquidity, how do we invest that liquidity, or how do we reduce it if deploying and
investing are not appropriate.
Deploying is about business opportunities. Investments are at the margin if you have the liquidity, what you can
do without increasing the risk profile for the bank. And then reduction is about offering different products to our
clients and potentially finding intercompany solutions. So we put all those things together. We are quite active. I
would say, given the current rate environment, the reduce dimension has become less of a priority than it was
when we started this a couple of years ago.
Richard, do you want to cover China?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Global Head-Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. The additional charges you expect is on a bottom-up basis, but you're right to some extent, the $600 million
on China CRE is based on a sort of bottom-up view of our particular borrowers and their particular situation and
circumstances. And then clearly, we then look at it at an overall provision coverage level. Is that sensible? What
are – what's the downside scenario? What are – what our peers doing? And so as we said morning, we're
comfortable with that charge as of December 31. And we also said that the situation in that sector has improved
since the year-end it's still very early days. I think there's still a lot to work through. But I think you've seen positive
developments in the last couple of months, whereas in Q4, you did see some deterioration. So it still – we're still
very [ph] much around (00:19:06) that sector, but more positive.
The rest of [ph] the world (00:19:09), not much to say really, 30 bps broadly spread, UK a pretty normal charge,
Mexico pretty normal charge. Those are our big, big books. Again, broadly split between retail and wholesale. No
big tall reason there or no big sort of overlays or [indiscernible] (00:19:27) adjusted for economic guidance
adjustment, so a pretty standard quarter for the book outside the China CRE, $600 million charge which we called
out separately.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
So can we assume that the go-forward ECL from a model-driven basis without anything idiosyncratic should be in
– around 30 basis points over the next several quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Global Head-Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, we got it to 40 bps. And then, as you know, our sort of guidance range, if you like, is 30 bps to 40 bps. So
we're at the top end of that range. That reflects difficult sort of economic circumstances at the moment with high
inflation and so on and so forth. Some company going from cash flow difficulties staying in the retail sector. So
that's the reason why we struck it at the top end of the range, obviously China CRE, as we mentioned already,
has – we've been making [ph] trillions (00:20:35) there over the last 18 months or so. So, 30 bps to 40 bps is our
guidance range and for now [indiscernible] (00:20:43) the top of that range, given our caution early in the year and
given the difficult economic circumstances, which much of the world is – has found itself in the last few months.

Thank you.

Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Rob.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
So we've got some more questions submitted over chat. So from Rob Thomas at T. Rowe Price. And Rob asks,
outside of China CRE, are there any areas of particular concern that you're monitoring closely? And also, can you
update on the progress of the sale of the Canadian business? How is this transaction to occur and what's the
timing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Global Head-Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
On the first, look, as you'd expect, our two big books are booked in Hong Kong and the UK. Clearly in Hong Kong,
it's the Hong Kong booked China CRE, which [ph] has been an issue (00:21:35), the book outside of that has
been very, very, very solid and remains so during 2022. And so clearly, [ph] it was where it was. It works when the
market is a (00:21:47) big market for us. [ph] It has own (00:21:50) economic difficulties in the last year. [ph] It
actually worked. (00:21:54) It seems to be coming out of those difficulties with reopening pretty strongly, albeit it's
still early days there, but certainly all the signs positive in terms of Hong Kong recovery during 2023 and beyond.
[ph] And our other book is the (00:22:12) UK. And again, it's really we watch them on small businesses and small
and mid-sized companies. [ph] The mid sector (00:22:20) who – some of whom have cash flow difficulties. As
you're aware, a fair chunk of the small business market is government guaranteed. And – but even there, we're
obviously watchful. So those are the areas where [ph] we're watchful (00:22:35) elsewhere in the world. I suppose
it's idiosyncratic risk, particular [ph] company in a (00:22:40) particular sector. You can get one or two of those
each quarter. But I would say, those are the major points which we're watching at the moment.
In terms of Canada, nothing to add to – we only just announced it a month or two ago. We're working through the
regulatory process as you would expect. And that's on track with nothing more to say. I would expect us to give
you a more fulsome update on where we're on the process probably at the half year. We do – we continue to think
that it will take much of 2023 to [ph] work for all the various (00:23:20) regulatory and other process we've got to
work with.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks for the questions, Rob. And another question submitted via text is coming from Paul Fenner-Leitão from
SocGen. I think Paul, we've covered your first question. But on the – to set the other two, specifically on the Stage
2, a big jump in total balances but no change in provisions. Why is that? And also, what can we expect for the
remainder of the year? [ph] Or most it's (00:23:49) the jump is in retail, but you would have thought that
corporates would have been the most volatile in Stage 2 balances.

Richard O'Connor A
Global Head-Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah – I mean, the methodological change on UK mortgages, nothing to flag. It's just a methodology change. UK
mortgages [ph] do perform (00:24:06) well for us. [indiscernible] (00:24:09) explained [ph] in the board of
(00:24:11) accounting in more detail. It's more of a technical change [ph] than anything else (00:24:15), wouldn't
flag anything there particularly. [ph] You know we're (00:24:20) more or less concerned what [ph] booked entities
worked very (00:24:20) for us and nothing much to say. Again in Stage 2 in wholesale, obviously, you've seen
some of the China CRE book go from Stage 2 to Stage 3 during, particularly in Q4, but also some in Q3 as well.
But nothing else to call out there in terms of anything more than normal quarterly volatility in the wholesale Stage
2 area.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
All right. And thanks for those questions, Paul. Just a reminder, if you do want to ask a question over the phone,
please do raise your hand. Otherwise, we have some more questions submitted over text from Ellie Dann at
Morgan Stanley. Ellie, I think we've answered a couple of the questions that you submitted, but there's a couple
here that we should cover.
So, Ellie says I notice that your AT1 issuance plan is $2 billion and is less than total redemptions for all the AT1
calls you have this year, given you've been operating above the official AT1 level [ph] of (00:25:22) regulators,
[ph] I think that you should (00:25:23) reduce your AT1 bucket in calling all of those and not replacing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Ellie. Thanks. Thanks for the question. Yes. The answer is yes. The reason an AT1 bucket specifically in
terms of regulatory requirements, right, there is a Tier 1 bucket. So we look at the Tier 1 in totality where the
amount of Tier 1 that we're issuing this year, in comparison to the calls, is in the part of plan to normalize the total
amount of the AT1 stack to the levels that I flag we think we are comfortable with. So, yes, we are comfortable
with that and also the discussion with the regulators is consistent with that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head-Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
And then, I think it looks like the last one from Ellie as well. Does the sale of the Canadian operations free up
some cash for the redemption of legacy securities trading above par?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
We – that's a creative connection between one area and another which we don't quite connect at all. The way we
think about the Canadian proceeds is, priority one is to pay an extraordinary dividend that we are foreseen to be
$0.21. After that, it's going to be a combination of additional buybacks and investment for growth. We haven't
quite decided what the proportion of the last two are. That's the way we're thinking about it.
