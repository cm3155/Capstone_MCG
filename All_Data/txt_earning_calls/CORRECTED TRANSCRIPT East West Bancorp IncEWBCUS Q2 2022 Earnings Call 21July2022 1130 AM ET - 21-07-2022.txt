Thank you, Julianna. Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our earnings call. I will begin the
review of our financial results on slide 3 of our presentation. This morning, we reported net income of $258 million
and earnings per share of $1.81 for the second quarter of 2022. Our earnings per share grew 38% annualized for
the first quarter of 2022. Total revenue of $551 million grew 45% linked quarter annualized, including record net
interest income of $473 million. Our strong revenue growth combined with controlled expense management drove
second quarter 2022 adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision income growth of 62% linked quarter annualized.
Our bottom line returns are industry leading will return 1.7% on average assets, 18% on average equity and 20%
on average tangible equity. All our profitability ratios expanded. The second quarter results demonstrate the
strength of East West business model, which is geared for outperformance. Our balance sheet is well-positioned
for rising interest rate and revenue growth this quarter reflected not only loan growth, but also net interest margin
expansion of 36 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Our loan portfolio is well diversified and second quarter growth
was broad-based across our major loan portfolios of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and
residential mortgage. Our deposit base spans consumer, small business and corporate commercial accounts.
Quarter-over-quarter, average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased 8% linked quarter annualized and
totaled 44% of average deposits for the second quarter.
We have a resilient balance sheet with strong capital and high liquidity. The diversification of our loans and
deposits is important not just because it helps support growth across different economic cycles, but because it
supports prudent risk management and our conservative credit culture.
Economic environment is changing, but we are well-positioned to navigate it through with confidence and
importantly, help our customers navigate it well too.
Slide 4 presents a summary of our balance sheet. As of June 30, 2022, total loans reached a record high of $46.5
billion. Second quarter average loans were $44.6 billion and grew 24% linked quarter annualized. Based on our
year-to-date results, we are updating our loan growth outlook for the full year to a range of 16% to 18%, up from
13% to 15% previously. All else equal, our outlook does imply a slower rate of loan growth in the second half of
the year compared with the pace of the first half.
Our current pipelines are healthy. Our borrowers' financial position and liquidity are strong, and we're very
optimistic about the future of East West Bank. However, in an environment of rising interest rate, real estate
transaction volume is slow impacting commercial and residential mortgage growth. Also, a high pace of C&I loan
growth in the first half of 2022 may moderate due to inflationary supply chain and other macroeconomic
pressures. Given the current economic uncertainty, we want to be conservative in our expectations and prudent in
our growth. Total deposits were $54.3 billion as of June 30, 2022, and second quarter average deposits were
$54.1 billion. Average total deposit grew 1% linked quarter annualized in the second quarter.
Turning to slide 5, earlier in the quarter, we repurchased $100 million of common stock or 1.4 million shares. As
you can see in the exhibit on this slide, our capital ratios are healthy and strong. As of June 30, 2022, we have a

common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12%. Total capital ratio of 13.2%. And a tangible common equity ratio of 8.3%,
which provides us with meaningful capacity for future growth.
East West Board of Directors has declared third quarter 2022 dividend for the company's common stock, the
quarterly common stock dividend of $0.40 is payable on August 15, 2022, to stockholders of record on August 1,
2022.
Moving on to a discussion of our loan portfolio, beginning with slide 6. C&I loans outstanding were $15.4 billion as
of June 30, 2022, an increase of 15% annualized from March 31, 2022. A couple of C&I commitments were $22
billion as of June 30, sequentially up by 20% annualized. Our C&I loan utilization rate was stable quarter-over-
quarter at 70%. Overall, similar to recent quarters, second quarter C&I growth was well-diversified across our
lending teams, geographies and specialized verticals, including robust growth in our private equity and
entertainment portfolios in terms of loans outstanding and commitments.
Slide 7 and 8 show the details of our commercial real estate portfolio, which is well diversified by geography and
property type and consists of low loan to value loans. Total commercial real estate loans were $18.5 billion as of
June 30, 2022, up by 37% annualized from March 31.
Growth was broad-based and well-diversified geographically and our property type segment grew in the second
quarter with strongest net growth in multifamily and industrial commercial real estate loan.
In slide 9, we provide details regarding our residential mortgage portfolio, which consists of single family
mortgages and home equity lines of credit. I would highlight that 84% of our home equity line of credit
commitments are in a first lien position. Residential mortgage loans totaled $12.5 billion as of June 30, 2022,
growing by 33% annualized from March 31.
I will now turn the call over to Irene for a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Dominic. I'll start with our asset quality metrics and components of our allowance for loan losses on
slides 10 and 11. The asset quality of our portfolio continues to be strong. Quarter-over-quarter, non-performing
assets decreased by 5%, down to $90 million, and the non-performing assets ratio improved by 1 basis point
down to 14 basis points of total assets as of June 30. Other OREO and foreclosed assets were down to zero as of
June 30. Total criticized loans increased modestly to 2.2% of loans from 1.9% as of March 31, largely from CRE
and C&I loans. Early stage delinquency loans decreased quarter-over-quarter to $39 million.
During the second quarter, we booked net recoveries of $7 million or 6 basis points of average loans annualized
compared to net charge-offs of 8 basis points of average loans annualized for the first quarter. The second
quarter recoveries were primarily in C&I loans. Our allowance totaled $563 million as of June 30, a 1.21% of
loans, compared to 1.25% as of March 31. The quarter-over-quarter change in the allowance largely reflects the
mix of the loan portfolio as of June 30, as well as second quarter loan growth. During the second quarter, we
recorded a provision for credit losses of $13.5 million compared to $8 million for the first quarter.
And now, moving to discussion of our income statement on page 12. This slide summarizes the key line items of
the income statement, which I'll discuss in more details on the following slide. Of note, amortization of tax credit
and other investments in the second quarter was $15 million, compared with $14 million in the first quarter. This is
4

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
lower than what we had previously anticipated because of timing. We expect the amortization of tax credit and
other investment expense to be approximately $40 million in the third quarter and $25 million in the fourth quarter
now.
Second quarter 2022 income tax expense was $83 million compared with income tax expense of $60 million for
the first quarter of 2020. Year-to-date, the effective tax rate for the first six months of 2022 was 22%. We currently
expect that the full-year effective tax rate will be approximately 21%, including the impact of tax credit and
investments expected in the second half of the year.
Now, I'll review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slides 13 through 16, starting
with the average balance sheet. Second quarter average loans of $44.6 billion, grew by $2.5 billion or 24%
annualized. The strong growth across all loan categories drove a favorable mix shift in average earning assets
quarter-over-quarter. In the second quarter, average loans made up 76% of average earning assets, compared
with 72% in the prior quarter.
Second quarter average deposits of $54.1 billion, grew by $104.5 million or 1% linked-quarter annualized. Growth
in average non-interest-bearing demand deposits, CDs, savings, and interest-bearing checking accounts was
partially offset by a decrease in average money market accounts. This quarter, we observed customers utilizing
their excess funds for acquisitions and investments.
Importantly, we saw quarter-over-quarter growth in average demand deposits, which made up 44% of our
average deposits in the second quarter, compared with 43% in the first quarter and 39% in the year-ago quarter.
Turning to slide 14. Second quarter 2022 net interest income of $473 million was the highest quarterly net interest
income in the history of East West, growing by 55% linked quarter annualized. The net interest margin of 3.23%
expanded by 36 basis points quarter-over-quarter.
As you can see from the waterfall chart on this slide, the net interest margin expansion in the second quarter
reflects impact of higher loan and earning asset yields, which increased the NIM by 31 basis points, plus the
favorable earning asset mix shift, which expanded the NIM by 12 basis points. This was partially offset by 7 basis
points of compression from higher cost of interest bearing funds.
Turning to slide 15. The average – the second quarter average loan yield was 3.95%, an increase of 32 basis
points quarter-over-quarter. The average loan yield comprised an average coupon yield of 3.83% plus yield
adjustments, which contributed 12 basis points to the overall loan yield in the second quarter. As of June 30 the
spot coupon rate on our loans was 4.19%.
In this slide, we also present the coupon spot yields for each major loan portfolio from the last three quarter end
periods. You can see the positive impact of rising interest rates on each loan portfolio of loans reprice. In total,
63% of our loan portfolio is variable rate, including 32% linked to the prime rate and 26% linked to LIBOR or
SOFR rates. Most of these loans we priced at least monthly.
Turning to slide 16. Our average cost of deposits for the second quarter was 17 basis points, up 7 basis points
from the first quarter. Our spot rate on total deposits was 32 basis points as of June 30, a year-to-date increase of
21 basis points. This translates to a 15% cumulative beta relative to the 150 basis point increase in the target fed
funds rate over the same period. In comparison, the cumulative beta on our loans has been 50% as our loan
coupon spot rates increased by 75 basis points year-to-date.

We started the rising interest rate cycle from a position of strength with historically high levels of demand deposits
for East West Bank, strong liquidity, and average loan-to-deposit ratio of 82% in the second quarter. These
balance sheet characteristics bolster the asset sensitivity benefits of our variable rate loan portfolio supporting
strong revenue growth through the cycle.
Moving on to fee income on slide 17. Total non-interest income in the second quarter was $78 million, down from
$80 million in the first quarter. Customer-driven fee income and net gains on sales of loans were $65 million,
essentially unchanged from the first quarter and up 3% year-over-year.
Moving on to slide 19, second quarter non-interest expense was $197 million. Excluding amortization of tax
credits and other investments and core deposit intangible amortization, adjusted non-interest expense was $181
million in the second quarter, up $6 million or 4% sequentially from a seasonally lower first quarter. The second
quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 33% compared with 35% in the first quarter. This reflects strong revenue
growth and our ongoing disciplined expense management.
And with that, I'll now review our updated outlook for the full year of 2022 on slide 19. For the full year 2022
compared to our full year 2021 results, we currently expect year-over-year loan growth, excluding PPP of
approximately 16% to 18%, reflecting year-to-date performance. Our updated outlook is an increase from our
previous outlook of 13% to 15% loan growth. Year-over-year, net interest income growth, excluding PPP, in the
range of 30% to 35%, this is an increase from our previous outlook of net interest income growth ranging from
22% to 24%. Our updated outlook reflects loan growth as well as the impact of anticipated fed funds rate
increases on our asset-sensitive balance sheet. Underpinning our interest income assumptions is the forward
interest rate curve as of June 30, with fed funds expected to reach 3.50% by year-end.
Adjusted non-interest expense growth, excluding tax credit investment amortization of approximately 9% to 10%
year-over-year, increased from our previous outlook for expense growth of approximately 8%. For 2022, we
currently expect that provision for credit losses will be in the range of $60 million to $70 million for the full year.
This is up from our previous outlook for provision for credit losses in the range of $50 million to $60 million.
Finally, we now expect that the full year 2022 effective tax rate will be 21%. This is compared with our previous
outlook, which is for an effective tax rate of 18% to 19%. The change in our outlook reflects higher pre-tax income
and a lower amount of tax credit investment as compared with our previous forecast. There will be quarterly
variability in the tax rate due to timing of tax credit investments placed into service. We currently expect that the
third quarter tax credit investment amortization expense will be approximately $40 million.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Dominic for closing remarks.

Thank you, Irene. In closing, we have had a great first half of the year, and I look forward to delivering strong
financial results for our shareholders in the second half of 2022. We're well-positioned to navigate the current
environment. Our balance sheet is asset sensitive. We have ample liquidity and strong capital. Our credit quality
is likewise strong. Our associates are focused on providing superior banking services to our customers. And I
wish to thank them for their efforts and excellent results.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I guess, first question, just around loan growth outlook. Dominic, you mentioned about maybe your guidance
obviously assumes some slowdown in the back half. Is that just out of being – wanting to be conservative given all
the things you laid out? Or over the last two to four weeks, have you actually seen customer appetite to borrow
and activity begin to slow down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think mainly, from our perspective is that, no one really know what the economy is going to be like, let's say, 6 to
12 months from now while there is a lot of prediction here and there. Our position is that with interest rate rising
naturally, there are not going to be as many refinancing on single family mortgages or CRE, et cetera. And even
on the C&I side, we expect that – we don't know what the Christmas is going to be like this year. Would
consumers still going to be as active in terms of purchasing gifts for families and friends or would they not. No one
knows at this stage.
But from East West Bank perspective is that while our customers are doing really well, we think that, at this stage,
it's only prudent for us to expect that there would be a slowdown, because it appears to me that logically, when
rates are rising higher, these refinancing activities would slow down. And then from the C&I side, maybe some
acquisition or major investment would also may not be happening, maybe deferring to future. So we just look at it
as, from an overall perspective, is that while our customers are doing just fine, we wanted to guide our projection
lower to make sure that, just in case, that economy do go into a direction that in a negative way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And I guess one question for you, Irene. Give us your assumption on the deposit beta as we think about
relative to your NII guidance. And just to put a fine point on your NII outlook, assuming 35% year-over-year
growth implies exit fourth quarter NII closer to $575 million to $600 million. I just want to make sure we're thinking
about that correctly?

Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I think, Ebrahim, your number is pretty close to where I think we'll end up. On the deposit betas, I think for
East West and really the entire industry, we've been able to land the deposit cost. So realistically, I think we're
very proud of what we've done year-to-date. I want to give a shout out to all of our team members, frontlines, this
variable rate pricing is very challenging. But realistically, we do expect that deposit beta to increase for the rest of
the year.
With that said, with the strong amount of operating accounts that we have, the strong amount of the DDA that we
have, a percent of our total deposits, overall, at this point, I'm very comfortable that our kind of lifetime or a cycle
through deposit beta will be much better than what we had in the last cycle.

Hey, I wanted to [indiscernible] (00:25:08) loan growth. I saw there's pretty strong growth in China in this part
quarter. I was wondering what are you seeing on the ground there and what you're actually [ph] facing in sort of
(00:25:14) second half of the year and if that's also assuming slower growth there?

Oh, about China? Oh, sure, sure. Well, China, our – yeah, well, our branch – well, our China operation and also
Hong Kong operation have done extraordinarily well in the first half of the year, because we all saw the headline
news from the media about lockdown in Shanghai and then all these quarantine requirement in Hong Kong. And

so our associates in that region went through some very, very tremendous difficulty personally like either most of
them being locked up at home while working and a few of them actually locked up in the office for over two
months. And the fact is they came through, throughout this time, they not only were able to get the business going
and took good care of our clients. In fact, they even grew loans and deposit. So they were doing really well. But,
overall, obviously China is only 5% of our balance sheet.
So, in that respect, obviously, it's not going to have a material impact to our overall financial performance. But I'm
very, very pleased with what they have done and they continue to grow very diverse C&I business, and that
covers from general manufacturing, consumer goods, entertainment, private equity, technology, clean energy and
digital media, health care, etcetera. So they really have done a good job at continuing to diversify their focus and
have very high-quality customers that they brought in. And in addition to that, our customers are doing very well,
as you can see, for the last several years now since the US started putting tariffs in place. Our loan portfolio in
China, the asset quality is pristine. We did not have any kind of like credit issues and they continue to perform
well. This is because we really believe that our bridge banking strategy, understanding of China, and our
expertise in cross-border business make a big difference [indiscernible] (00:28:07) placed at with East West, we
have the expertise in cross-border business between US and China that allow us to be able to offer unique value
proposition and services that are really important and relevant to the business.
Whether the US business and doing business in China or Chinese business doing business in US, we do offer a
unique banking service for them that 99-plus-percent of the banks in the United States don't offer. So in that
respect, we have substantially less competition and we're able to choose exactly the high quality customers we
want to do banking with. So we're very, very pleased with how everything's going right now. So as of today,
obviously our associates in Hong Kong and China are all back to the office and doing business as normal. So we
expect them to continue to be able to do good work for the second half of the year.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay, thanks. And maybe more of a big picture question as far as [indiscernible] (00:29:25) as of adjusted
efficiency ratio reaches a 30% and potentially below. I mean, what is the kind of the lower for which you've kind of
[indiscernible] (00:29:38) in efficiency ratio? I know you've done a lot of positive operating leverage rates. And is
there a potential for you to accelerate some investments particularly next year because of where that efficiency
ratio is at?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I think all the efficiency ratio, Brandon, we don't have a ratio that we're trying to append to. Normally this is
the time when Dominic goes through the calculation of the numerator and denominator, obviously for East West.
We remain disciplined on spending. With that said, we have continued to make the investments we think
necessary to support our business, our cash management products. You see that with the outstanding growth we
have cross-border as Dominic talked about, also particularly on the consumer side, on the digital side as well.
Also, in this kind of environment, we're a asset sensitive bank. So with the revenue increasing, obviously that
efficiency ratio is adjusted related to that. But just to recap, we don't just try to guide to our efficiency ratio, but we
make investments we need to support the business.

Yeah, efficiency ratio as report card kind of like number, return of equity, return of asset, the efficiency ratio, these
are report card numbers. So we looked at it and said well, proud to be in that position. However, we really are
much more focused in measuring like input such as deposit growth, loan growth, interest margin expansion, asset
quality and also making sure that expenses growing according to what the balance sheet call for. That's what
we're trying to work on.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Dominic, positive just surprised to see the buyback in the quarter. How do we think about
perspective uses of the rest of the buyback given the markets, the stock valuation, but also uncertainty in the
macro?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Okay. On the buyback, well, I said it before that the bank is always shareholders friendly, but we are relatively, I
say, more prudent and conservative than other banks. But we are opportunistic. When we do see that it's the right
time and the right place, we do strike. And so, that's what we did in the second quarter.
Here's what I looked at, based on the economic landscape today and looking forward and seeing that the fed will
continue to increase interest rates with many economists not predicting good economy going forward, we just feel
like that now is the time that we probably want to pause and wait. And this is a kind of like very consistent East
West Bank philosophy that when we do feel that it's the right time to do something that we have plenty of capital,
plenty of earnings and etcetera, well, obviously, when the opportunity arise, we will step in and do the right thing
for shareholders. But in the meantime, we feel that preserving capital is the better way to go.
Now, reflecting back several years ago, obviously, most banks were actively doing buyback and East West was
one of the isolated few that is not. But if you looked at what we've done in the last four to five years, we have
actually almost doubled our balance sheet organically, not acquisition, organically.
So obviously, we knew we have the engine that can grow and we did not wanted to spend the capital into
buyback when we knew that we have plenty of growth opportunity. And it didn't hurt when we have plenty of
capital right in the beginning of COVID. And so, our position is that we'll always be very considerate of
shareholders return. However, we always wanted to look at it from a long-term basis. And so, that's how we come
to this conclusion about buyback and not buyback.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thank you. That's great perspective. If I could ask one more, a common thread throughout the quarter for all the
banks [ph] has been (00:34:37) deposits and levels. And I think the concern in the market is that with the fed
executing Q2, there's going to be a little bit of an air pocket on deposits. I'm sure you've looked over your portfolio
and kind of separated what may be at risk. But could you share with me – share with us any observations about

what pieces of the book might be at more risk and how much do you think could actually flow out if the Fed does
what it's going to do? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think the key part at East West Bank deposit franchise is our retail banking deposit. We unlike many regional
banks, we actually have a very, very strong retail banking deposit franchise, very stable plenty of customers out
there banked with East West Bank for many years, and they're the one that normally we do not expect a lot of
volatility. Obviously, when rates do rise in a substantial way, we do need to make sure we take care of them and
pay them higher rate. But I don't expect that there will be a lot of movement or volatility from the retail banking
side. In fact, I do expect that we have opportunity to grow even more.
One good example is that we started a business checking deposit products about a year ago, less than a year
ago, actually, just the last six months, and we brought in about close to $500 million of DDA deposits. And we will
continue to be able to find opportunity to grow DDA balances in these very small business customers. And I
looked at it is that, in addition to that, we continue to see activities of overseas investors, they are still putting
money in the United States, and most of them do look at East West of their first choice.
So, from that standpoint, we feel pretty good. Obviously, we have commercial accounts that some of them have
more volatility due to the operating needs and so forth. So those are the ones that we keep a close eye on it. But
we also feel that, because of our deposit rate today, we got plenty of room to work with our customers. If we do
need to pay a little bit higher rate to retain more deposit is something that we obviously have much more flexibility
than maybe other banks.

Operator: Our next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Maybe just following up a little bit on the deposit side, when you look at your guidance
for NII, what's the expectation for overall deposit growth and I guess, maybe your sort of loan-to-deposit ratio in
this environment? And it sounds like, I guess, Dominic, you think that in that scenario, you can still see DDA
balance growth from some of these new initiatives. Is that the right way to look at it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We do expect that deposits will grow for the entire year. I think quarter-over-quarter, especially on an average
basis, point-to-point, you will see variability. For example, this quarter as well, historically we've had clients, one
client in particular, related to property tax payments made in the second quarter. The balances are down and then
we saw that this quarter as well.
With that said, I would also just comment on just the granularity and the deposits that we have. As Dominic
mentioned, not only do we have kind of a broad base on the retail side – small business on the retail side, overall
on the commercial side as well. The deposits are very granular in nature. So that's something that we think will
continue to help us as we go through the cycle.

So with that backdrop, is that it's assuming, I guess we should – we could assume that you'd be comfortable
getting that loan-to-deposit ratio back north of 90% if the loan growth is there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, if the loan growth is there, we've commented on this before, high-80s, low-90s is something we're very
comfortable with. Again, particularly with the granularity of the deposits that we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, we don't have a problem of growing our loan balances due to like a pressure from deposit because at this
80-plus-percent loan-to-deposit ratio. We have plenty of room. So we just – the reason that we do not have a very
high expectation of high loan growth for the second half despite the fact that we have good pipelines and good
momentum is because, the economic outlook overall does not look very good. But if it turns out that we continue
to find high-quality loans that we can book and we will, simply because we got plenty of deposits to support it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. Thanks. And then just, as a follow up – as my second question, looking at the expense guide and the
increase there, is that primarily just performance, based on better revenue drives better performance incentive
comp? Or are there some new initiatives in there for the franchise?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We always make incremental investment, I mean, every single year. I mean, East West philosophy is never really
do a major, major big project and load it in one year. And that cost, so volatility of our earnings. So we'll continue
to invest. And of course, there are some inflationary factors in here simply because of wages and other type of
miscellaneous expenses, all have gone up, because we saw, a 9.1% consumer price index number that came out
recently. So, our position is that we feel that while we are managing our expenses very prudently, we expect that
it will go up slightly. So, that's why we're guiding it up from 8% increase to 9% to 10% increase.

Hi there. My question pertains to loan growth in the guide. So, I guess, just assuming you have lower pace of
growth in the second half, I mean, it wouldn't be surprising given the first half growth, but could you maybe – the

pipeline going into the third quarter, and whether or not your projections assume a drop-off in the fourth quarter or
if the drop-off is balance between the third and the fourth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So, we – at this point, again, the projection is more or less, how do I put it, we are just being prudent just because
we have pipelines, sometimes pipeline does not result in funding. Our projection right now is that, yes, there may
be a lot of deals in the making, but I expect that there will be some prudent investor which are our great
customers who will look at it maybe two months from now, three months from now, and if rate continue to go up
like what the Fed expected to do, they come to a conclusion that maybe I shouldn't move forward.
And I just kind of looking at it on the downsized scenario, there may be a lot of deals that people were thinking
about doing and then I'm not doing. And those are the kinds of things that we're anticipating. I mean, a very
simple answer will be like on a residential mortgages area. We would expect that people that may expected to
revise their mortgage, decided not to because the rate is so high.
It doesn't make sense or if you expected to buy a home, buy a second home or third home, decided not to. Again,
because rate is high, price haven't come down yet enough to make it a good deal. These are what I call the
transitional time. Transitional time in a way that when the price still stay pretty very much up there, but then the
interest rates suddenly make the economic less attractive. So that would discourage people making investments
[indiscernible] (00:44:17) say or maybe make investment in certain type of business they're involved with.
So this is the kind of logic that we are going through in our mind that despite the fact that our relationship
managers out there and our branch managers out there are having bringing in more new clients, and more
opportunities to do more deals, we just looked at it as that naturally. People would just take a break when they are
not sure having some certainty about what the horizon would be, which is very different that once you get into a
recession or maybe once you get the tail end of the recession, people are jumping in left and right, taking
advantage of the distressed prices and so forth.
So in this standpoint, what we see right now is that we are just assuming that maybe in the third and fourth
quarter we'll transitioning slowly into that kind of uncertain path. However, if for some reason things change and
for the positive, obviously, we will expect a strong loan growth.
