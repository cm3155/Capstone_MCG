Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kay, and good morning. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
Despite the exaggerated noise from the recent crisis that has largely subsided, our second quarter results reflect
strong trends highlighted by strong asset quality and overall portfolio health, strong and consistent fee income that
helps us navigate this elevated interest rate environment, continued yet prudent opportunities in loan growth
particularly in commercial and in industrial lending, strong client engagement and traction across our diverse lines
of business. These solid results in several areas were masked by a higher interest expense, driven by the Federal
Reserve's monetary tightening actions and the resulting increases in funding costs in the interest rate
environment we live with today.
As noted in our last call, the deposit pricing pressures the industry is experiencing is not dissimilar to the price of
commodity or raw materials for other industries. As other industries would, we are reacting to our cost of raw
material by pricing our products for this environment. As we have noted, 62% of our existing loans also repriced
with movements in rates.
Like others in the industry, we also maintained elevated levels of excess liquidity during the second quarter. This
resulted in brokered CDs and borrowing levels higher than we've typically carried, which also impacted interest
expense and our margin.
To help mitigate the continued impact of liability pricing, we maintained flexibility on the asset side of our balance
sheet. We have a loan-to-deposit ratio on the lower side of peer averages, a largely variable asset base and
strategically planned cash flows. This is not to diminish the challenges the industry faces from higher interest
expense or the rotation of deposits to rate-bearing options. This has had an impact on margins and spread as
evident during this earnings season.
On the macro front, the economy continues to be resilient with some pressures in isolated pockets and industries.
It also seems that the bulk of the tightening cycle may be behind us, and the prevailing questions are, how long
will the Fed maintain rates at these elevated levels and do we end up with a soft landing?
Due to recent industry volatility, we've maintained our focus as a growth company. We've reported double-digit
annualized loan growth, excellent credit metrics, solid fee businesses, and largely stable and diverse deposit
base. As our costs increase, we remain disciplined in pricing our loans and continue our efforts to control
operating expenses. The UMB has a track record of sticking to the business model that has proven itself over
time, even as we adapt to changing circumstances.
Now, I'll cover a few highlights from the quarter. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $90.1 million or
$1.85 per share. Operating net income was $93.8 million or $1.93 per share. Net interest income decreased for
the first quarter as strong loan growth and improved asset yields were offset by increased deposit costs and
liability mix shifts. We have continued to benefit from asset repricing with a linked quarter beta on loan yields of
nearly 70%. This is in line with the beta on the total client deposits, which excludes brokered deposits.
Both the income and expense levels contained a few factors that impacted linked quarter and year-over-year
comparison. As a reminder, second quarter of last year contained a $66.2 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our
Visa B shares. Ram will provide more color on the drivers in his discussion. We posted average quarterly loan
growth of 17.3% on a linked quarter annualized basis. Even as we've grown loan balances, asset quality
remained strong with net recoveries of $139,000 for the quarter. Nonperforming loans were just 0.09% of loans as

of June 30 and provision for credit losses was just $13 million for the quarter, driven by loan growth and
macroeconomic variables.
We are incredibly proud of our current and historical credit performance. If you look at our 20-year history ending
with the full year of 2022, our annual losses have averaged just 29 basis points and our 10-year average was 26
basis points. What makes it even more impressive is that over these periods, we have enhanced our reach and
footprint through market and vertical expansion and are generally a more complex organization. We've achieved
this through our focus on risk management and with consistent approach that comes from having the same team.
Our allowance-to-loan coverage ratio further increased 2 basis points sequentially to 99 basis points of total
loans, a level we believe to be prudent. Criticized loans were essentially flat from the prior quarter. Our total watch
list levels, including past loans, will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. But as evidenced by our recoveries this
quarter, we continue to have very little migration to loss.
The drivers behind our growth in average loan balances this quarter are on slide 24, nearly half the increase was
driven by C&I customers, followed by construction, lending and residential real estate. While customer sentiment
is mixed with some uncertainty about the economy, commercial pipeline remained steady.
Total pipeline loan production, as shown on slide 25, was $986 million, while payoffs and paydowns represent
3.4% of loans in the first quarter. The average for the past five quarters was 3.6%, in line with our longer-term
trends.
Commercial real estate and construction growth in the second quarter came in predominantly in the multifamily
and industrial categories. Credit quality is strong across our book, and the CRE portfolio is well diversified by
property classification, tenant type and geography, as shown in the line of business section of this presentation on
slide 37 and 38.
As we did last quarter, we've included LTVs, recourse and other statistics by property type as well as geographic
detail on the portfolio. The office portfolio represents just 4.5% of total loans, with only an average size of $8.5
million.
Looking ahead in the third quarter, we see opportunities in our various lending verticals across our footprint. We
will continue to remain disciplined on pricing, further emphasizing lending accompanied by meaningful deposit
relationships. On the other side of the balance sheet, average total deposits decreased $87 million or 1.1% on an
annualized basis from the first quarter to $31.5 billion.
Included in the linked quarter reduction in average deposits were typical public funds fluctuations of $284 million
and normal course of business activities such as tax payments. As we point out each quarter, activity in our
commercial and institutional customer base along with seasonal public fund balance fluctuations differentiate us
from peers with large retail businesses. Deposit balances will naturally ebb and flow for typical business
purposes, including payroll dividends and other activities.
We have deep relationships with long-term clients who rely on UMB not only for deposits, but for multiple financial
products and services to manage and grow their businesses. Our pipeline for new to bank deposit relationships
also remains healthy, and while nominal, we continue to add commercial accounts despite the common industry
narrative.

While cost of deposit acquisition will mimic current market rates, we also benefit from cheaper sources of funding
in our corporate trust and aviation businesses that can be lumpy from time to time. To reiterate, as I noted earlier,
we've been diligent and successful in pricing our loans for the market dynamics around our funding costs.
Slide 30 and 31 show the composition and other characteristics of our deposit portfolio. At the end of June,
deposits stood at $33.5 billion, an increase of 5% from March 31, and uninsured deposits adjusted to exclude
affiliated and collateralized deposits were at 41% of total deposits as of June 30.
Now, I'll turn it over to Ram for a more detailed look at our results. Ram?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Thanks, Mariner. I'll share a few additional drivers of our second quarter results, then I'll discuss some of the key
balance sheet items that continue to be top of mind in the current environment.
Net interest margin for the second quarter was 2.44%, a decrease of 32 basis points from the linked quarter.
Drivers included negative impacts of approximately 45 basis points from deposit pricing and mix and 14 basis
points related to changes in Fed funds purchased, repurchase agreements and short-term borrowing levels.
Assets included a positive 21 basis points from loan mix and repricing and 10 basis points from the benefit of
refunds and changes in liquidity balances.
The cost of total deposits for the quarter was 2.17%. Excluding brokered deposits that we added to enhance our
liquidity levels, that cost was 1.95% compared to 1.62% in the first quarter for a linked quarter beta of 70%. As
Mariner mentioned, betas on loan yields kept pace with this quarterly beta.
We continue to benefit from the shorter tenor of our asset base, including the fact that 69% of our loan portfolio
reprices within 12 months. Cycle to-date, we've seen betas on loans and total earning assets of 56% and 50%,
respectively. Similarly, the beta on total funding costs, which consider the benefit of DDA and the impact of
borrowing levels, has been 50% while the cost of total deposits has experienced a 43% beta cycle to-date.
Our outlook for net interest income going forward will be impacted by a variety of factors, including the shape of
the yield curve, anticipated Fed hikes, along with the timing of those hikes, the length of the Fed pause, timing of
rotation out of wholesale funding sources, and the replacement cost and potential for any additional
disintermediation of DDA, the rate-bearing categories, and continued competition from deposit alternatives.
Our DDA has averaged 33% of total deposits, down from 38% in the first quarter, driven both by increase in
interest-bearing deposits and decline in DDA balances. The current percentage of DDA to total deposit mimics the
low point during the 2015 to 2017 tightening cycle. While we do not anticipate any material changes to these
levels, the migration can be episodic and vary from quarter to quarter due to the nature of some of our business
lines.
A July rate hike seems to be priced in. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we would expect a terminal
beta of 50% for total deposits and 60% for loans through the end of the cycle. We would expect some additional
modest margin compression in the third quarter, driven by the timing of the July rate hike.
Our reported noninterest income of $138.1 million contained some market-related variances, including a $1.3
million decrease in customer-related derivative income and a $902,000 decrease in company-owned life
insurance income. The $6.2 million linked quarter increase in net investment security gains relates to the
5

impairment of a sub-debt security last quarter along with the increased valuation of equity investments this
quarter. Additionally, we recognized a gain of $4 million on the sale of some noncore assets in the second
quarter.
The detailed drivers of our $241 million in noninterest expense are shown in our slides and press release. A few
items of note, we recorded $7.4 million in additional salary and bonus expense, largely driven by a $4.9 million
severance expense in the quarter and higher salaries related to annual merit increases that were effective in the
second quarter. These increases in salary and benefits line were partially offset by seasonal decreases in payroll
taxes and insurance and lower 401(k) accruals.
Excluding $3.2 million of deferred compensation and the $4.9 million of severance costs as well as other typical
timing variances, we would put our quarterly starting point expense run rate closer to $230 million. Our effective
tax rate was 18.1% for the second quarter, compared to 20.8% in the second quarter of 2022. The decreased rate
was driven primarily by a larger portion of income on tax-exempt securities. For the full-year 2023, we anticipate
that the tax rate will be approximately 17% to 19%.
Now, turning to more detail on the balance sheet, I'll start with our investment securities portfolio shown on slides
28 and 29. Our average investment securities balances remained relatively flat from the first quarter at $11.4
billion, excluding the $1.2 billion of industrial revenue bonds in the held-to-maturity category. During the quarter,
$243 million of securities with an average yield of 2.07% rolled off.
The yield on our total AFS portfolio increased to 2.70%; and the HTM portfolio, excluding the IRBs that I
mentioned, had an average yield of 2.33% for the second quarter. The portfolio is split roughly 60/40 between
available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, and the AFS book has a duration of just under 4 years. Additionally, the
portfolio is expected to generate more than $1.6 billion of cash flows in the next 12 months, providing further
funding flexibility and opportunity to deploy in assets that have more attractive yields. The roll-off of these
securities, which have a blended rate of 2.16%, will also improve our AOCI position over that period.
As of June 30, the unrealized pre-tax loss on the AFS portfolio was $766 million or 10.3% of the amortized cost.
For the HTM portfolio, this loss was $576 million including the IRBs.
Slide 33 highlights our liquidity position along with the continued sources of funding available to meet customer
and operational needs. As of June 30, we had $16 billion in available liquidity sources. Liquidity coverage of
adjusted uninsured deposits increased to 117% at quarter-end. Additionally, if needed, we have some further
capacity to add broker deposits, which could boost the coverage ratio to 129% of adjusted uninsured deposits.
Also, on that slide, we've included our regulatory capital ratios for June 30. Our CET1 ratio improved to 10.65%
and compares favorably to the peer median. Tangible book value per share was $52.54, an increase of 3.8%
compared to the same period a year ago. Since 2018, we have experienced a 5.6% annualized growth rate in
tangible book value per share. Our tangible common equity ratio was 6.22% at June 30, improving to 7.90% when
excluding the impact of AOCI.
We believe our strong capital and liquidity levels provide the flexibility to support our customers, grow our
business and deliver returns for our shareholders while giving us the ability to address uncertainty in the industry
as well as any upcoming regulatory changes.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll now turn it over back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the
call.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh, great. Good morning. Ram, maybe just starting with the top line, you talked about little bit more pressure on
the margin. How should we think about just the level of NII? It feels like we're – the trough was near, given
Mariner's growth comments, but interested in comments of where you see the cadence of NII going over the back
half of the year. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I'll take that, Chris. Mariner, and if I just – [indiscernible] (00:19:04), we've said in the previous comments, mid-
single digits growth and I think that's probably still reasonable. A lot of things, a lot of variables, both headwinds
and tailwinds to shake out for the rest of the year. But for what we can see right now, that holds true with maybe
some – the headwinds remain right there, persistent. See how they play out, but it's a fair starting place.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Just so I'm clear, the net that's – mid-single digit is full-year net interest income growth compared to 2022, right?

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Last year's base is about $13 million. Yeah. Again, a lot of – as Mariner said, a lot of moving parts, some of which
I highlighted, right, when the Fed is done, how long they keep it, and what might happen with DDAs. Some big
deals that come our way from our pipeline, things like that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, there's – as you know, because of the institutional and corporate, it's pretty lumpy. We can have a
big corporate trust deal come in just as easily as we can have tax payments go out. I mean, it's hard to tell exactly
what happens from one quarter to the next.

Okay. But that would seemingly imply that the stepdown from Q1 to Q2 would reverse and you'd have growth off
of these levels? That's my math, right, that's kind of what your messaging?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Again, a lot of moving parts. But to Mariner's earlier point about that mid-single, right, a lot of these things need to
come together for that to happen, but I'm not ready to call a bottom out on NII. But at the same time, I'm not
saying it's going to be much lower than where we are. That loan growth is going to be certainly a driver of it. Net
interest income, what happens?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Borrowings.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yes. Yeah. And with the stepdown from 1Q to 2Q, as we highlighted, was a lot of the excess liquidity that we
carry, the brokered CDs that we issued in response to some of the things going on in March.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And those are coming down, right, as we go into the back half of the year, so...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Maybe just one more on your capital. Your balance sheet is in great shape from a capital perspective. I saw
the million share in the release last night for the buyback. Any thought, any updated thoughts on capital return
given the market seems to settle a little bit?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, I mean, the share repurchase approval is to give us that flexibility. We obviously don't have any plans to do
that, but we want to have that flexibility as we watch the stock price in the market and our company perform in the
back half of the year. I'm not sure how to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. And what we did yesterday was the annual cadence that we have for the board to approve some share
repurchase authorization. Typically, we have done it in April for 2 million shares; and this time around, out of
prudence and just given the circumstances and the environment we all find ourselves in, we just asked the board
to approve 1 million share authorization. At this point, I would say probably not a lot of appetite to do that because
we still see loan growth opportunity. Like we've said, our capital stack is largely going to be used up for loan
growth.

please go ahead. Your line is open.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Hello, Nate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
A question just in terms of what you guys are seeing from a deposit pricing perspective outside of the portion of
the funding basis index to short-term rates. We've heard from some banks that deposit pricing pressures have
slowed to some degree more recently. Curious if you guys are seeing that, and to what extent you guys would
maybe be more competitive on some rates into the second quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, it's hard really to predict a lot of that. I think from my vantage point, I think we are coming to the back end. A
lot of that to do with what the Feds has yet to do, still to do. Yeah. I think from our – we believe that we went
through most of this cycle early, right, having more of a commercial and institutional deposit base.
So if what the Fed is doing is leveling off, which seems to be with an announcement of another 0.25% today,
maybe another 0.50%, another 0.25%. So 0.50% total, right? The level of increases to the deposit rates for us
should be leveling out. We've taken most of that pain, I believe. So that doesn't mean it's – they're not going to go
up slightly, but I just think that the rate of increases is definitely coming off.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
Sorry. I was just going to add that – and when it does level off and the deposit increase rates level off, we should
still see the increases on the loan side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. That kind of answers my second question, Mariner, in terms of – in a theoretical higher for longer interest
rate environment, I imagine we should see some pretty substantial margin expansion just given the lag and
repricing impact on loans. And with those short-term deposits – I'm sorry, those short-term indexed deposit
repricing slowing, is that a fair way to kind of think about the change to the margin in that type of rate
environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Directionally, yes. Yes, for sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And I understand and appreciate that you guys don't pay much attention to any of your balances versus
average. But in the period, deposit growth was fairly pronounced in the quarter. And just curious how you guys
are thinking about the pipeline for deposit growth. And it sounds like the loan growth pipeline remains pretty solid,
but should we kind of expect deposit growth to lag loan growth going forward? And I think some of the margin or
NII lift that you guys are speaking to for this year should be a function of just some of the remix and maybe less
deposit growth relative to loan growth going forward or at least over the next couple of quarters. Does that makes
sense?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I think the way to think about it is in this environment with an inverted yield curve and the
attractiveness of money market funds, off-balance sheet funds in this environment, it is more challenging, right, to
grow your deposits at the rate that we were before the inverted yield curve. So we always have the brokered CDs
and we can always do campaign money to keep up with with loan growth in the short period before the rate cycle
normalizes. And when that happens, we should be able to pick up the deposit rate growth again. But I think from
the standpoint of UMB, it's important to note that we come into this cycle with a very low loan-to-deposit ratio. So
we have a lot of room to run with loan growth without feeling like we are stressing our balance sheet. So we're
sitting with 70-ish loan-to-deposit ratio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. [ph] 70% loan (00:27:07).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
70%. So we have room to run there during this rate cycle that we're in to protect us there, to wait for the
environment to change and normalize deposit growth.
[ph] I hope (00:27:29) you'd add anything in that comment.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Oh, no, just I would go back to the prepared comments that we said about the – on the institutional side,
particularly, we have an active deposit pipeline that we're pursuing. So to your question, yes, it's a difficult deposit
environment, but unlike most peers, we have a lot of different sources of funding that's available to us that Mariner
walked us through. So I would go back to what we said in our prepared comments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think that I was reacting to his specific question about keeping up with the same rate. Our deposit growth
will not keep up with the same rate. We will not grow at the same rate of our loans, and we're protected by our
loan-to-deposit ratio with that. We definitely expect our deposits to grow, and I think that to Ram's point about the
nuance of our institutional business, as you know, from one month or quarter to the next, we can have an $800
million, $900 million corporate trust piece of business come in and sit on our balance sheet for six or nine months,
just as easily as we can have a tax payment go out on the other end. So that's why we focus on the averages
instead at the point in time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got you. Okay. One last one for me just in terms of what you're seeing from a lending competition perspective. I
imagine some of the consistency in your pipeline is a function of maybe competitors pulling back that are maybe
more liquidity constrained as you guys, but would just be curious to kind of hear where you guys are seeing
particular growth and what's going on competitively that's also kind of supporting the strong pipeline coming out of
the second quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James D. Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Bank, NA (Investment Management)
Yeah. This is Jim Rine. We're seeing plenty of opportunity still and rates remain competitive as they ever have
been. We have seen competitors pulling back. I think it's a common theme right now as it relates to banks are
looking for full relationship more than transactional lending. And if it doesn't come, if the opportunity doesn't come
with additional funding, folks are taking a much stronger look at whether or not they want to take on a particular
large opportunity like CRE, for instance, or even participations. So especially in the syndication banks without
additional fee income or additional deposits are definitely pulling away from those.
Regarding pricing, banks are still looking loans and their good credits are still able to command a decent rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Marginally, we're seeing more rates on everything though, obviously, with the – which is why our betas are doing
