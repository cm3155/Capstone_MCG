Dominic Ng
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Julianna. Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our earnings call. I will begin the
review of our financial results with slide 3 of our presentation. Our strong financial performance in 2022 was
characterized by strong revenue growth, which was driven by a strong loan growth and net interest margin
expansion in a rising interest rate environment, combined with disciplined expense management and solid and
stable asset quality.
Together, all these drivers resulted in industry-leading profitability, both for the full year and the fourth quarter of
2022. East West achieved record earnings of $1.1 billion or $7.92 per share for the full year of 2022, an increase
of 30% year-over-year. Our 2022 total revenue of $2.3 billion was our highest ever and grew 29% year-over-year.
Our pre-tax pre-provision income of $1.6 billion grew 40% year-over-year in 2022. We returned a 1.8% on assets
and 21% on tangible equity for the full year.
Now, for the fourth quarter of 2022, we reported net income of $337 million and earnings per share of $2.37,
which grew 55% annualized quarter-over-quarter. Our industry-leading returns were 2.1% on assets and 25% on
tangible equity for the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter pre-tax pre-provision profitability was nearly 3%.
Now, let's go to slide 4. And slide 4 presents a summary of our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, total
loans reached an all-time high of $48.2 billion, an increase of $771 million or 6% annualized from September 30.
Fourth quarter average loan growth was likewise 6% annualized. Average loan growth in the fourth quarter was
well-balanced between our major loan portfolios of commercial real estate, residential mortgage and commercial
and industrial.
Total deposits were a record $56 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of $2.1 billion or 16% annualized
from September 30. Fourth quarter average deposit growth was 7% annualized. Growth was driven by time
deposits, reflecting a successful branch-based CD campaign during the fourth quarter.
Our deposit book is well-diversified by deposit type. And 38% of total deposits were in noninterest-bearing
demand deposits as of December 31. Our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 86% as of the end of the year from
88% as of September 30.
Turning to slide 5, as you can see in the exhibit on this slide, all our capital ratios expanded quarter-over-quarter.
As of December 31, 2022, we had a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.7%, a total capital ratio of 14%, and a
tangible common equity ratio of 8.7%. Quarter-over-quarter, our book value and our tangible equity per share
increased 6%.
I am pleased to announce that East West's board of directors approved a 20% increase to the quarterly common
stock dividend from $0.40 per share to $0.48 per share, and equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.92 per share.
The new dividend will take effect in the first quarter, payable on February 21, 2023 to stockholders of record on
February 6, 2023.
Moving on to a discussion about loan portfolio, beginning with slide 6. As of December 31, 2022 C&I loans
outstanding were $15.7 billion, sequentially up 2% annualized, and up 11% year-over-year. Our C&I portfolio is
well-diversified by industry and sector.

Slides 7 and 8 show the details of our commercial real estate portfolio, which is well-diversified by geography and
property type, and consists of low loan-to-value loans. Total commercial real estate loans were $19.1 billion as of
December 31, 2022, up 8% annualized from September 30, and up 18% year-over-year.
In slide 9 we provide details regarding our residential mortgage portfolio, which consists of single family
mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Our residential mortgage loans are primarily originated through East
West Bank branches. I would highlight that 82% of our HELOC commitments were in a first-lien position as of
December 31, 2022. Residential mortgage loans totaled $13.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, up 9% annualized
from September 30, and up 19% year-over-year.
I will now turn the call over to Irene for a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement.
Irene?

Irene H. Oh
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Dominic. I'll start with our asset quality metrics and components of our allowance for loan losses on
slides 10 and 11. The asset quality of our portfolio continues to be stable and strong. Quarter-over-quarter,
criticized loans decreased 1% and the criticized loan ratio improved 5 basis points. Both classified and special
mention loans decreased from already low levels as of September 30. At year end, the nonperforming assets ratio
was 16 basis points of assets, unchanged quarter-over-quarter.
Charge-offs continue to be at low levels. During the fourth quarter, we recorded net charge-offs of $10 million, or
8 basis points, compared with net charge-offs of 6 basis points in the third quarter. Our allowance totaled $596
million as of December 31 or 1.24% of loans, up from 1.23% as of September 30. During the fourth quarter, we
recorded a provision for credit losses of $25 million compared with $27 million for the third quarter.
While asset quality remained strong and the current credit environment is benign, we continue to remain vigilant
about credit. We're actively managing the loan portfolio and taking proactive measures to build our allowance for
loan losses.
And now, moving to a discussion of our income statement on slide 12. This slide summarizes the key line items of
the income statement, which I'll discuss in more detail on the following slides. Of note, amortization of tax credit
and other investments in the fourth quarter was $65 million compared with $20 million in the third quarter. At the
same time, the quarterly effective tax rate was 13% in the fourth quarter compared with 23% in the third quarter.
This fluctuation is due to tax credit investments that were closed in the fourth quarter and the related products that
were placed into service. This resulted in a lower effective tax rate and an increase in the amortization expense
for the fourth quarter. For the full year of 2022, the effective tax rate was 20%.
I'll now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slide 13 through 16, starting
with average balance sheet. As Dominic mentioned in his remarks, fourth quarter average loan growth at 6%
annualized was well-balanced among our major loan portfolios, an average deposit growth of 7% annualized,
reflected a successful branch-based deposit campaign. Our average loan-to-deposit ratio was stable quarter-
over-quarter at 87%. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits made up 39% of our average deposits in the
fourth quarter.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Turning to slide 14, fourth quarter of 2022 net interest income of $605.5 million was the highest quarterly net
interest income in the history of East West, growing 39% linked-quarter annualized. Our net interest margin of
3.98% expanded 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter. As you can see from the waterfall chart on this slide, net
interest margin expansion in the fourth quarter reflected the impact of higher loan and earning asset yields, which
increased the net interest margin by 82 basis points, partially offset by 52 basis points of compression from the
funding side.
Our net interest income growth benefited from rising benchmark interest rates because of [indiscernible] (11:31)
our asset-sensitive loan portfolio. To preserve net interest income when interest rates go down, we added $3.25
billion of swaps and collars in 2022, which included $1 billion added early in the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide 15, the fourth quarter average loan yield was 5.59%, an increase of 84 basis points quarter-over-
quarter. The average loan yield comprised an average coupon yield of 5.53% plus yield adjustments, which
contributed 6 basis points to the overall loan yield in the fourth quarter. As of December 31, the spot coupon rate
of our loans was 5.92%.
In this slide, we also present the coupon spot yields for each major loan portfolio for the last five quarter ends.
You can see the positive impact on rising interest rate on each of the loan portfolios as loans have repriced. In
total, 61% of our loan portfolio was variable rates, including 30% linked to the prime rate and 27% linked to LIBOR
or SOFR rates.
I would also highlight that over 40% of our variable rate commercial real estate loans had customer level interest
rate derivative contracts in place. To clarify, this is distinct from the balance sheet hedging I discussed a minute
ago. With the customer level derivative contracts, we've helped our customers enter into low-level interest rate
swaps, collars and caps, currently structured to help protect customers against rising debt service costs. At the
same time, the loans remain variable rate on our balance sheet and the bank benefits from the asset sensitivity.
Turning to slide 16. Our average cost of deposits for the fourth quarter was 106 basis points, up 55 basis points
from the third quarter. Our spot rate on total deposits was 134 basis points as of December 31, a year-over-year
increase of 125 basis points. This translates to a 29% cumulative beta relative to the 425-basis-point increase in
the target Fed funds rate over the same period. In comparison, the cumulative beta on our loan has been 58% as
our loan coupon spot rate increased 248 basis points year-over-year.
We started the rising interest rate cycle from a position of strength, with historically high levels of demand
deposits for East West Bank and strong liquidity. This has bolstered the asset sensitivity benefits of our variable
rate loan portfolio, supporting strong revenue growth through the cycle. We are pleased with the lag in deposit
beta cycle to date.
This has come through careful deposit cost management with a 29% cumulative beta cycle to date, we are
outperforming prior rising interest rate cycles. With 39% of our average deposits and interest-bearing accounts,
and with the growth that we have had in treasury management products and services since before the pandemic,
we feel comfortable about continuing to navigate the current cycle well.
Moving on to fee income on slide 17. Total noninterest income in the fourth quarter was 65%, down from 76% in
the third quarter. Customer-driven fee income and net gain until the loans were $66 million, down 4.5% or 18%
annualized from the third quarter, and up 4% from a year ago. Year-over-year, we saw growth across most of our
fee income lines of business.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Moving onto slide 18. Fourth quarter noninterest expense was $257 million. Excluding amortization of tax credits
and other investments and core deposit intangible amortization, adjusted noninterest expense was $192 million in
the third quarter, down 2% quarter-over-quarter or 7% annualized, driven by lower compensation and employee
benefits expense. Once again, we generated strong positive operating leverage with total revenue growth of 27%
annualized in the fourth quarter plus a sequential decrease in expenses. The fourth quarter adjusted efficiency
ratio was 29% compared to 31% in the third quarter. Our adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income grew 43% linked-
quarter annualized and our pre-tax pre-provision ROA was an attractive 2.95% in the fourth quarter.
And with that, I'll now review our updated outlook for the full year of 2023 on slide 19. For the full-year 2023
compared to 2022, we currently expect year-over-year loan growth in the high-single digit percentage range. We
expect production from all of our major loan portfolios in 2023. Year-over-year, we expect net interest income
growth in the low-20% rate range. Underpinning our interest income assumptions is the forward interest rate
curve as of year-end, which assumes a peak Fed funds target rate of 5% by April 2023 and the year-end Fed
funds target rate of 4.75% with the cut late in the year.
In our modeling, we assume that deposit betas will continue to rise in 2023. Adjusted noninterest expense growth,
excluding tax credit investment amortization in the range of 10% to 11%, we expect our revenue and expense
outlook to result in positive operating leverage year-over-year.
In terms of credit, for 2023, the provision for credit losses will largely be driven by changes in the macroeconomic
outlook. We are providing our expectations for gross charge-offs, which are expected to be in line with our recent
gross charge-off experience if macroeconomic conditions stay stable. For context, the gross charge-off ratio was
8 basis points in 2022 and 17 basis points in 2021.
Asset quality to date is excellent. And the potential losses from any problem loans are limited. However,
realistically, as the economic backdrop weakens, we would expect to see some credit normalization from the very
low levels to date.
In terms of tax items, we currently expect that approximately $150 million of tax credit investments, excluding low
income housing tax credits will close and go into service in 2023 and therefore, be part of our tax rate calculation
for the full year. The tax credit amortization related to these tax credits should be approximately 95% of the tax
credit investment amount for the full year.
For the first quarter of 2023, we expect that $92 million of these tax credits will be reflected in the tax rate
calculation, the tax credit amortization to be approximately $22 million for the quarter. There will be quarterly
variability in the tax rate and the tax credit amortization due to the timing of tax credit investments placed into
service.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Dominic for closing remarks.

question comes from Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Please go ahead.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Sure. My first question is on the NII guide. On slide 16, you guys highlight the total deposit beta of 29%. You got
47% interest-bearing deposit beta through the end of last year. I was wondering what deposit beta you're baking
into the guide at this point. I know you mentioned you expected deposit beta to rise through this year, but are you
thinking mid-30s or upper-30s to the overall cycle or are you baking at something higher than that? And then, how
do you think about deposit growth from here and what that means for borrowing levels which are still very low?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Great question, Dave. At this point in time, we're modeling the full-cycle beta will be 40% for 2023 and at
the same time for interest-bearing deposits – the deposit beta of 60%. And that's factored in with our NII guidance
that we have of the increase in the low-20%. Overall, I think with the good growth that we've had in deposits in
general, along with our successful campaigns for CDs that are lower than others – competitors in the market. At
this point in time, I think we'll be able to continue to fund our loan growth with the deposits. Certainly, though,
we're very opportunistic and look at that from the perspective of cost.

Great. And then, just one follow up on the back end of the year, when you – with your Fed rate cut, was curious
what you're expecting for the deposit cost movement as a result of that cut. Are you thinking that you'll get
immediate benefit, or are you thinking there might be a little bit of a lag there with the first couple cuts? Thanks
again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I wanted to ask on the hedges that you've been putting on the books. Can you speak to how those might impact
loan betas for both the remaining of the rate cycle – the rate hike cycle, and also when the Fed begins cutting
rates, and also, how much more you plan to do on your hedging efforts from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, great question. Certainly, the specifics of how much that's impacted us, quarter-to-date, I do not have that,
but we can get that information after the call. Certainly, as we started adding this, fourth quarter, third quarter,
there was a little bit of impact as far as the – largely against the CRE loans that we've kind of hedged.
We have $3.25 billion of swaps and also collars that we've put on. At this point in time, in discussion with our
ALCO committee, there's probably another couple billion that we would look to do, but certainly we're
opportunistic about this and also evaluating the overall balance sheet and the positioning of that. So that's
something that we'll continue to evaluate to see what we think makes the most sense given the changes in the
interest rate environment as well.

Got it. And is there a bottom we can think about on NIM in the event that the Fed begins cutting or is that too early

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then in – just on credit. In November, you emphasized like everyone else, you've
been watchful for a normalization on credit and you're focused on early detection of any cracks. In the reviews
that you've been making, have there been any covenant breaches or any other cracks to note?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I mean, I think certainly on an individual loan basis that is happening, right? But overall, I think we're very positive
from the perspective that on credit, as we do continue to do these reviews on our commercial books, our
consumer books throughout, what's positive is there are not a lot of new problem loans, same loans that we were
working through last couple years continue to be things that we work through, but not a lot of new problems in that
process. So that's certainly something that we feel is positive and positions us well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. We've been actively managing the loan portfolio overall. So, as you can see in the criticized asset
percentage, it's relatively benign. So, so far, surprisingly, asset quality is very, very good. And we look at the rising
interest rate, obviously, that's why we've been aggressively managing the portfolio and see how it goes. And I
always do this ongoing loan review and so far, so good.

Operator: The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey, good morning. I guess maybe just sticking with asset quality, so, appreciate that what you just said, Dominic,
you haven't seen any stress within the portfolio. But is that a timing issue or when – in your slide 15, you're
showing how interest rates yields have gone up on these loan portfolios. Is it timing issue or do you feel good
about the loan book and your ability of these borrowers to absorb where, if the Fed funds were to peak out at 5%,
they should be able to handle this where it doesn't become a credit issue for East West. Like, do you feel good
about that? Do you have visibility into that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, when it comes – when you say timing issue, we obviously, when we do our stress tests on these real estate,
we are obviously projecting. So, it's not something that we just are looking at it as of today whether they can
handle and so forth. So, from that perspective, we feel pretty good about the liquidity level of our clients in terms
of the cash flow that they've been getting from the existing business.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
So, I guess, in a way that what we notice is that the cash flow is still pretty good. I think it's really coming back
down to the economy, the economy is too strong. Now, if you looked at it we project a much more deteriorating
economy, that would be very different. At this point, we don't see it. Things are going pretty well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And I guess, just separately, in terms of loan growth, so appreciate the lower growth guidance, but just talk
to us in terms of what are the pockets. I know Irene mentioned you expect loan growth across categories, but any
particular verticals, any markets where you're seeing more strength and more market share opportunities, as we
think growth and maybe potential for upside surprise on that growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think, overall, we have always been very focused in having a more diversified growth. So, from that standpoint,
there's always going to be one particular industry vertical here and there that seems to do a bit better than the
others. However, overall, if it get too far, we reign it in anyway. So, in that standpoint, that's why you always see a
much more – even kill more a diverse type of loan portfolio that we have here is because we actually manage it.
So – but I would say that, I mean, at just looking at maybe a couple of weeks so far, we do have a few more like
private equity capital call line commitments that we have originated. But I would expect that if it continues to go in
that direction, we probably have a stronger PE loan growth.
And then also last year that we actually have, surprisingly, pretty decent growth from our Greater China region
and so – despite the pandemic. And so, we expected that they may be able to continue to do quite well. Now,
obviously, they have a much smaller balance sheet. But as a percentage growth, they are doing pretty well. So,
we may have a few other different areas that we'll be able to step-up because we also have a very strong
competitive teams within the organization. Everybody wanted to do better. So, we'll just expect that different team
will step-up in different quarter.

Hey. So, I wanted to kind of touch again on the NII guide and in particular your outlook for the trajectory in net
interest margin. It appears if the margin stays flat from 4Q levels, you could potentially hit the guidance just from
that, but I'm curious what your assumptions are as far as the trajectory in NIM going through the year and also
your – with the forward rate curve assumptions?

Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I think at this point, my focus is really more on the NII, Brandon. We do expect when we look at our
guidance, you can tell and you can do the math of my guidance as well that we do expect the NII to grow from the
fourth quarter level. Then it depends really more about the fluctuation or what happens per quarter, but both we
expect to be positive in 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then in regards to your outlook for deposit growth, what areas or what categories of deposits do you
see most of that growth coming from? And could you talk more about your ability to kind of mitigate losses in
DDA?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Great question. When we look at our deposit portfolio and our customers, one of the things that we benefit
from is just the diversity of customers we have. Certainly, in order to quite candidly remain competitive, we had
these deposit CD campaigns in the fourth quarter and we have one right now price below market but attractive
enough rate and also six-month duration, we don't want that to go too long. And so that is something that we
continue to do. Relative to other kind of funding costs, right now, we think it's attractive. It's also a customer base
that stays with us and has a larger relationship with us.
When we look out for 2023 and where we think deposits are going to grow, I'd say across the board, although
realistically in this kind of rate environment, it's hard to maintain the deposit balances in the DDA accounts at the
level that we have pre-rising rates. We are still onboarding new customers all the time. Pipelines are strong on the
deposit side. So, we are very kind of positive about what we're doing. The investments that we made in treasury
management, cash management, products, services certainly are something that we're seeing a benefit today.

I wanted to highlight also, I think at the height of excess liquidity, which is during PPP time, back in late 2020
because of COVID, we had like maybe it went all the way up to close to 43% as a percentage of DDA to the
noninterest-bearing deposit to the entire deposit portfolio, 43%. Today, we're down to 38%. So, as you can see,
there was a lot of liquidity then. But by nature, even without interest rate rising and so forth, you expect that the
success of liquidity would not be sustainable.
So, we are actually very, very pleased throughout the last few quarters watching our noninterest-bearing deposit
and see what the percent you send and just kind of each quarter drop 1-basis-point and so forth. And then, so far
so good. So, we drop now to 38%. It's still 38%. That's a lot of noninterest-bearing deposits sitting there.
And on – by the way, the other part is that we continue to bring in new customers. We continue to bring new
commercial customers. We're still onboarding this new relationship one at a time. So, in time, it will continue to
grow the noninterest-bearing deposits. It's just that there are some excess liquidity that in relationship what the
market rate in terms of deposit it is today, naturally, there are people who are moving some of the maybe excess
liquidity they put into whether money market accounts or maybe CDs account and so forth.

So that's why you see that there is a some gradual reduction on noninterest-bearing deposit balance. But in terms
of number of accounts, it keeps going up.

Operator: The next question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to follow up on the loan growth outlook. I was wondering how –
what you guys were assuming for utilization rates in your guide and then any color on how loan pipelines are
shaping up versus 9/30?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
At this point in time, we're not assuming a change in utilization rates, Casey. We're assuming flat from where
we're at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Understood. And then on the credit quality side, everything's still pretty benign and holding stable. I was
wondering, is that true also for the $2 billion exposure in China, which obviously gets a lot of attention from
investors?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
China is even better. So, we've always have a very, very strong, pristine loan portfolio. And so, it's still exactly the
same. So, we feel that with the economy opening up, I think it would only going to help us better. While we don't
expect that there will be some sudden surge of loan origination in 2023, because while the economy opened up,
it's going to still take a little bit time for the business to sort of get back on track. It will probably benefit us more in
2024 than 2023.

Hi. Good morning. This is Clark Wright on for Gary Tenner. I don't want to beat a dead horse, but just in terms of
the loan growth again, are you expecting it to be front-end loaded or forward [indiscernible] (36:43) the quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A

year.

Operator: The next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Dominic, on capital, I think the dividend was a pretty strong signal, given how much capital
you have and the position you're in. Is that really the only capital return that you're contemplating right now given
the economy. I know you've been resistant to the buyback. But I just want to see if there's any change in tone
there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I just want to interject, we have not been resistant to the buyback. We bought back a $100 million last year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, we did $100 million in the second quarter of 2022. We still have $254 million outstanding that we can
execute any time we want, because has been approved by the board last year. And we are very opportunistic in
terms of the buyback. You have to look at is that fourth quarter, we just racked up 25% return on tangible equity.
So, we obviously, it's not one of those banks that really need to do this. However, we are always shareholders
friendly. So, if we ever see that there is great opportunity, we absolutely will use the capital at the right moment. I
thought what we did in the second quarter for the $100 million was a quick execution, because at that time with
that price, sure I would jump that right at it. So – but we have to be also be mindful. One of the great advantage of
East West Bank, if you look at our capital ratio today in this very kind of somewhat benign economic environment.
And we because of the – and because of the interest rates that we are doing extraordinarily well from a return on
equity and return on assets standpoint.
However, had this been a completely different economic situation, had it been like a 6%, 7% unemployment rate,
interest rate were in a much higher level, that business were having trouble, we, at that point, having this kind of
capital, would absolutely give our customers much stronger confidence about why they wanted to be banking with
East West than the others. So, I was always mindful of that. This has been doing really, really well for us back in
2008 and 2009 during global financial crisis. Somehow, somewhere, we just have a bit more capital than our
peers. And so, ultimately, customers just feel more comfortable with us. So, we've always been very mindful of
that. So that's one key reason.
The other thing is that we don't want to not have some excess capital, just in case that there are even potential
acquisition opportunity and so forth. So, we are very choosy in terms of potential acquisition. However, if there is
something available, we're always ready to execute. So, all of that is a combination of multiple factors that caused
13

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
us to be where we are today. And – but one way or the other, we are very comfortable with where we are. And if
we're ever in a situation that we feel that the stock price or whatever the other reason that we feel, or maybe
somehow there's not enough of a confidence of growth that we may want to do some buyback, we absolutely will
step in. We'll do the right thing. So, you can count on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you for that perspective. Thanks, Dominic. Just I do want to ask the tax rate. I'm not the tax expert,
but I want to make sure I understand the cadence of the amortization. So, Irene, you said roughly 95% of the
$150 million will flow through the am line. That's like a little over $140 million. And I think the Q1 is a little over $20
million.
Can you help us with the tax rate? Because it looks like amortization last year was a decent amount lower and the
tax rate was 20%. So, I'm coming to a tax rate kind of mid to upper-teens based on this guidance. I just want to
make sure I don't make a mistake. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Julianna Balicka A
Director-Investor Relations & Corporate Finance, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Hi, Chris. This is Julianna. In terms of the tax rate, it will vary depending on your assumptions for pre-tax income,
which will vary with your assumptions for provision for credit costs obviously.
In terms of the tax amortization, on a full-year basis, when you look at that $150 million of tax credits, think of it as
a 95% of that will go into the tax credit amortization. However, we booked amortization when the credits close and
go into service. Therefore, for what's on the docket for the first quarter, that's $22 million. That means
amortization rate in quarters two, three, and four will be higher in order to come up into that full-year 95% number,
as credits close and go into service. So, we wrote in the slide deck that for the first quarter, $92 million of tax
credits will be in the tax rate calculation and that will go on up through the year. And I can follow up with you
offline for a more detailed calculation, if you like.

I guess when you look at the moves you've made with swaps and collars and the potential to add more, is your
goal to get to sort of eliminate all that asset sensitivity earlier or much of that asset sensitivity earlier in 2023, or
how should we be thinking about just your general asset sensitivity positioning over the first few quarters?

Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Great question. I would say that that isn't our goal, Jared, to remove our asset sensitivity. What we want to
make sure is that when we look at the balance sheet and the loan portfolio, that we are able to evaluate what we
think as might happen, hedge kind of risks that we see from interest rate perspective. But we still expect to be
asset-sensitive even with these changes that we're making.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then my follow-up, any outlook on the fee income lines and what you're seeing in terms of potential for
growth there among the different lines?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, great question. On the fee income, I would say the areas that are – if you break that down as far as things
that are within our control, things that have to do with investments that we've made, growth that we see with our
customers, that's going great. Market kind of driven factors, things that maybe we don't have a control over, I think
that's going to continue to be challenging, especially if you look at it from the perspective of mark-to-market on
derivatives and then also FX and that bounces around. But aside from that, we expect that from a core customer
perspective and the growth perspective, we'll still see those increases.

Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey. Thank you. I guess I just wanted to follow up on China in terms of, one, given the reopening that's underway
in China, does that create maybe stronger growth opportunities as we think about this year? And how are you
thinking about allocating more capital to that business? And I appreciate a lot of the business is kind of cross-
border and there's cross-border connectivity, but would love to hear if there are increased growth opportunities
emerging in China.
And also, Dominic, would love to hear your views as you're now the Chair of APEC. Like, how do you see that
relationship evolving and creating more opportunity for the bank given its strategic positioning? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
In terms of the opening of China, it's not just a – like a, sort of like a post-pandemic opening at – the ability to
travel in and out of China, and so to help the foreign investments to add ease about not having the restriction to
do quarantine and so forth. But that's actually a baked factor, because many of our management team have not
been back to China for the last two or three years. And so, I think that likewise, the same thing for many of the
business – who around the world – who are doing business in China, and they were restricted by that. And then
with this opening up, I think that's a huge factor that helps substantially. That's one.
The second part is really the Chinese Government new policy towards business. Obviously, the last two or three
years, the business sectors were having some hard time. Whether you're in a social media, high tech, video
gaming, entertainment, real estate, education, you name it, every one of these sectors were hammered, because
15


East West Bancorp, Inc.
(EWBC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
of a much more challenging policy or with – or a regulation that came up that hindered their ability to grow. Now,
just for the last few weeks, things turned in a completely different direction. Government are providing support to
the real estate sectors, they are also really getting much more business-friendly to these other industries, et
cetera.
And so, with that, we also see that foreign investments are getting their license approved and getting their, let's
say, additional investment to get majority shares, also sign-off, and so forth. So, we do see that at this stage, the
business opportunity is much better.
Now, then reflected on East West Bank, we have always traditionally been mainly focusing on cross-border
business. And so, I think that with this additional opening up and the more business-friendly kind of policies,
clearly, it would encourage cross-border business. Please keep in mind that despite the – from the US side, that
we can see that maybe that attitude towards China has not improved, but on the other hand, we ought to keep in
mind is that the business have been restricted – and usually, related to national security issues, the highly
sensitive or maybe some very, very high-level technology or biotech type of business that quite frankly, that East
West really do not have anything to do with. And our focus is on these very, very common, like electronics,
garments, and business items that import/export all investment to both shores, that to the consumer market and
et cetera, that are not related to national security issue.
So, we do feel that there are plenty of room to grow. Even during the pandemic when China literally was shut
down against – by the borders, we still find way to grow our loans, we still bring in additional new customers. So,
we expect that to continue to grow. But I don't think that East West will be an organization that just because of this
new opening that we will just rapidly trying to push a lot of capital in there and we're going to continue to stay
steady and we'll continue to be observing the market and make sure we make the wise choice. But I expect that in
terms of a sustainable growth opportunity in the Greater China region and also particularly, as you mentioned,
throughout Asia, we feel pretty confident that that will be something that we expect to have a good opportunity
going forward because the Chinese business also have expanded into Southeast Asia. What is it? Vietnam,
Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, et cetera.
So, we expect that many of our customers who continue to migrate their business into those regions which will be
beneficial to us. And that's also the reason why we open the rep office in Singapore. So, we will continue to
evolve and expand into Asia and to make sure that we can effectively roll this business model as the bridge
between the East and the West.
