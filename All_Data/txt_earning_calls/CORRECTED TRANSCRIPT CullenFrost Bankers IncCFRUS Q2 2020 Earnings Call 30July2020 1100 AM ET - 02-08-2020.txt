Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, A.B., and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review the second quarter results
for Cullen/Frost, and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, will also provide additional comments, and then
we'll open it up for questions.
In the second quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $93.1 million or $1.47 per share compared with earnings of $109.6
million or $1.72 per share in the same quarter of last year, and $47.2 million or $0.75 a share in the first quarter of
this year. Beyond the financials, the second quarter was an extraordinary one for Frost. To add our response to
the COVID-19 pandemic, we've been continuing serving customers with appointments in our bank lobbies, to our
motor banks, with our online and mobile banking service, to around-the-clock telephone customer service, and
then our network of more than 1,200 ATMs. I'll talk in more detail about our Houston expansion and our Paycheck
Protection Program loans.
But for now, I'd like to point out that we have been completing our organic growth initiatives and still achieving the
same award-winning level of customer service that Frost is known for despite having more than two-thirds of our
employees working remotely. In fact, during the second quarter, we learned that Frost had achieved its highest
ever Net Promoter Score with a jump from 82 to 87. And that's a score that would be the envy of many well-
known brands, and it's a testament to our core values and our ability to consistently take care of our customer's
needs especially during trying times.

More recently, we learned that process among the banks, that Greenwich and Associates (sic) [Greenwich
Associates] (00:03:29) has identified as standouts in their response to the pandemic based on customer surveys.
In fact, Frost was one of only two banks to be named a standout in both the small business banking and middle
market banking categories.
I mentioned the Paycheck Protection Program. As of June 30, when PPP loan applications were initially
scheduled to end, we had helped nearly 18,300 of our customers get PPP loans, totaling more than $3.2 billion. In
the State of Texas Frost was number three in PPP lending with 5% of the loans. In San Antonio, Fort Worth, and
Corpus Christi Frost is number one in terms of PPP loans approved, and in San Antonio, we had more PPP loans
than Bank of America, Chase, and Wells Fargo combined. We did well helping businesses of all sizes, but I'm
particularly pleased that more than three quarters of our PPP loans were for $150,000 or less and close to 90%
were for $350,000 or less. PPP applications have been extended into August and we're still taking anywhere from
a few to 50 applications per day. Through July we've taken an additional 500 applications for over $22 million or
an average size of about $45,000.
Meanwhile, we're setting up processes to help borrowers get their loans forgiven. We've heard many, many
messages of thanks from our customers whose businesses were aided by PPP, and the efforts of Frost Bankers
had helped saved hundreds of thousands of jobs. Those results are more reflective of our culture and our
philosophy than even the numbers we're reporting today for the second quarter.
Average deposits in the second quarter were $31.3 billion, up by more than 20% from the $26 billion in the
second quarter of last year and the highest quarterly average deposits in our history. We're grateful for the
confidence our customers have placed in us during these times. Average loans in the second quarter were $17.5
billion, up by more than 20% from the $14.4 billion in the second quarter of last year. And that includes our strong
showing in PPP loans, but our loan total would have been up approximately 5% even without PPP.
In the second quarter our return on average assets was 0.99% compared to 1.4% in the second quarter of last
year. Our credit loss expense was $32 million in the second quarter compared to $175.2 million in this first quarter
of 2020 and $6.4 million in the second quarter of 2019. That first quarter provision was significantly influenced by
our energy portfolio stress scenario of oil at $9 per barrel for the remainder of 2020. Oil prices have since
stabilized at levels well above that assumption, and the energy borrowing base redeterminations are 95%
complete.
Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $41 million compared with $38.6 million in the first quarter and $7.8
million in the second quarter of last year. Annualized net charge-offs for the second quarter were 0.94% of
average loans. Second quarter charge-offs were related to energy borrowers that have been discussed for
several quarters.
Nonperforming assets were $85.2 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $67.5 million at the end of
the first quarter, and $76.4 million at the end of the second quarter last year. At their current level, nonperforming
assets represent only 22 basis points of assets, which is well within our tolerance level and are level lower than
our average nonperforming assets over the past nine quarters.
Overall delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the second quarter were $91 million or 51 basis points for
the period in loans. Those numbers remain within our standards and comparable to what we've experienced in
the past several years. The payment deferrals we have extended to customers due to the pandemic-related
slowdown have had some impact on delinquencies. Through the end of the second quarter, we granted 90-day
4

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 30-Jul-2020
deferrals totaling $2.2 billion. Of loans whose deferral period has now ended, which is about $1.1 billion, only $72
million worth have requested a second deferral.
Total problem loans, which we define as risk grade 10 and higher, were $674 million at the end of the second
quarter compared to $582 million at the end of the first quarter, which happened to be a multi-year low. A subset
of total problem loans, those loans graded 11 and worse, which is synonymous with the regulatory definition of
classified totaled $355 million for only 12% of Tier 1 capital.
Energy-related problem loans were $176.8 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $141.7 million for
the previous quarter and $93.6 million in the first quarter of last year. To put that into perspective, the year-end
2016 total problem energy loans totaled nearly $600 million. Energy loans in general represented 9.6% of our
non-PPP portfolio at the end of the second quarter. If you include PPP loans, energy loans were 7.9%. As a
reminder, the peak was 16% back in 2015, and we continued to diversify our loan portfolio and to moderate our
company's exposure to the energy segment.
As expected and as we discussed in the first quarter call, the pandemic's economic impacts on our portfolio have
been negative but manageable. During our last conference call, we discussed portfolio segments that have had
increased impact from economic dislocations brought on by the pandemic. Besides energy, we've narrowed these
down to restaurants, hotels, aviation, entertainment and sports, and retail. A total of these portfolio segments,
excluding PPP loans, represented almost $1.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. Like the energy portfolio,
we continually review these specific segments and we have frequent conversations with those borrowers to
assess how they're handling current issues. Combined with our risk assessments, these conversations influence
our loan loss reserve for these segments, which is 2.52% at the end of the second quarter.
Overall, our focus for commercial loans continues to be on consistent balanced growth including both core loan
component which we define as lending relationships under $10 million in size, as well as larger relationships while
maintaining our quality standards. We're hearing from customers in all segments about economic impact of the
pandemic as well as the uncertainty ahead. Those factors have had an impact on our results.
New relationships are up by about 28% compared with this time last year. Largely because of our strong efforts in
helping small businesses get PPP loans. When we ask these businesses why they came to Frost, 340 of them
told us that PPP was a key factor. The dollar amount of new loan commitments booked through June dropped by
about 3% compared to the prior year. Regarding new loan commitments booked, the balance between these
relationships went from 57% larger and 43% core at the end of the first quarter to 53% larger and 47% core so far
in 2020. And that's about where it was this time last year.
The market remains competitive. For instance, the percentage of deals lost to structure increased from 61% this
time last year to 75% this year. Our weighted current active loan pipeline in the second quarter was up 24%
compared with the end of the first quarter. The first quarter numbers were low and reflected the uncertainty about
the pandemic's effect.
On the consumer side, we continue to see solid growth in deposits and loans despite the impact from the
pandemic and the reduction in customer visits to our financial centers. Overall, net new consumer customer
growth rate for the second quarter was 2.2% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Same-store sales,
however, as measured by account openings were down by 30% through the end of the second quarter, as lobbies
were opened only by appointment only and through drive-in tellers.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 30-Jul-2020
In the second quarter, 59% of our account openings came from our online channel, which includes our Frost Bank
mobile app. Online account openings in total were 72% higher compared to the second quarter of 2019. The
consumer loan portfolio was $1.8 billion at the end of the second quarter, and it increased by 4.3% compared to
last year.
Overall, Frost Bankers have risen to the unique challenges presented by the pandemic and its resulting
shutdowns with a mix of keeping our standards and sticking to our strategies, along with a truly remarkable
amount of flexibility and adaptability.
Our Houston expansion continues on pace, with four new financial centers opened in the second quarter and two
more opened already in the third quarter for a total of 17 of the 25 planned new financial centers. Those new
financial centers include our location in the Third Ward where customer response has been enthusiastic, even
though our lobbies are open for appointment only.
Our employees manage those new financial center openings while most of them are working remotely due to the
pandemic, and also while working nonstop to help our business customers [ph] stay afloat (00:14:16) with PPP
loans. And that commitment and dedication is what Frost philosophy and culture is all about.
As I mentioned earlier, we've gained a lot of new business relationships through our PPP efforts. Customers that
are new to us are learning what a longtime customer has always known, that Frost is a source of strength for
customers and our communities, and also a source and force for good in people's everyday lives.
I've told our teams that their efforts are historic and heroic. And I'm extraordinarily proud of our company that
we've been able to help so many small businesses get through these extraordinary times. [ph] Despite that
(00:14:53) many pandemic challenges remain particularly here in Texas, we've seen the spirit and dedication of
Frost employees who live our philosophy and culture every day gives me optimism that we will help our
customers find a way through this situation and come out stronger.
And now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, with some additional comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil.
I wanted to start out by giving some additional financial information on our PPP loan portfolio. As Phil mentioned,
we generated over $3.2 billion in PPP loans during the quarter. Our average [indiscernible] (00:15:32) portfolio
was about 3.2% and translates into about $104 million. Our direct origination costs associated with these loans
totaled about $7.4 million, resulting in net deferred fees of about $97 million. About 20% of the net fees were
accreted into interest income during the second quarter.
Looking at our net interest margin, our net interest margin percentage for the second quarter was 3.13%, down 43
basis points from the 3.56% reported last quarter. Excluding the impact of our PPP loans, the net interest margin
would have been 3.05%. The 43 basis point decrease in our reported net interest margin percentage primarily
resulted from lower yields on loans and balances at the Fed, as well as an increase in the proportion of balances
at the Fed as a percentage of earning assets, partially offset by lower funding cost.
The taxable equivalent loan yield for the second quarter was 3.95%, down 70 basis points from the previous
quarter, impacted by the lower rate environment with the March Fed rate cuts and decreases in LIBOR during the
6

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 30-Jul-2020
quarter. The yield on PPP loan portfolio during the quarter was 4.13% and had a favorable 3 basis point impact
on the overall loan yield for the quarter.
Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged $12.5 billion during the second quarter,
down about $463 million from the first quarter average of $13 billion. The taxable equivalent yield on the
investment portfolio was 3.53% in the second quarter, up 7 basis points from the first quarter.
Our municipal portfolio averaged about $8.5 billion during the second quarter, flat with the first quarter, with the
taxable equivalent yield also flat with the first quarter at 4.07%. At the end of the second quarter, over 70% of the
municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF-insured. The duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the
second quarter was 4.4 years compared to 4.6 years last quarter.
Looking at funding sources, the cost of total deposits for the second quarter was 8 basis points, down 16 basis
points from the first quarter. The cost of combined Fed funds purchase and repurchase agreements, which
consist primarily of customer repos, decreased 80 basis points to 0.15% for the second quarter from 0.95% in the
previous quarter. Both balances averaged about $1.3 billion during the second quarter, up about $36 million from
the previous quarter.
Moving to non-interest expense, total non-interest expense for the second quarter decreased approximately $3.5
million or 1.7% compared to the second quarter last year. The expense decrease was impacted by the $7.4
million in PPP loan origination costs that were deferred and netted against the PPP processing fees, which were
amortized into interest income as a yield adjustment over the life of those PPP loans. Excluding the favorable
impact of deferring those origination fees related to PPP loans, total non-interest expenses would have been up
$3.8 million or 1.9% compared to the second quarter last year.
In addition to the reduced expense run rate during the second quarter due to the pandemic's effects on the
business environment, we continue to focus on managing our discretionary spending and looking for ways to
operate more efficiently. As we look out for the full-year, adding back the $7.4 million in deferred expenses related
to the PPP loans I mentioned previously, we currently expect annual expense growth of something around 6%,
which is down 2.5 percentage points from the 8.5% growth guidance we gave last quarter.
Regarding income tax expense, we did recognize a $2.6 million onetime discrete tax benefit during the quarter
related to an asset contribution to a charitable trust during the second quarter. Excluding the impact of that item,
our effective tax rate on our year-to-date earnings would have been about 3.1%.
With that, I'll turn the call over – back over to Phil for questions.

Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. It's Brady Gailey.

Good morning, Brady.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, I was a little surprised to hear that 20% of the PPP fees were captured in the second quarter. That seems a
little higher than what some of the other banks have disclosed. Any color around how you're able to capture that
amount of fees before any sort of forgiveness?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
[ph] Not that (00:20:49) we're assuming, we look at those loans, Brady, on a pool basis. And so, we're really just
looking at it over the expected term of those loans. We expect a big portion of those to pay off later this year. So,
when I look out, I think our current expectation is it will earn about 60% of that fee in 2020 and about 40% of it in
2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Perfect. And then, I heard your comments on some of the issues with the tax rate coming in lower, so it's actually
negative for the quarter. But can you just go over that again? And is there anything else that's driving this tax rate
to be lower than it normally is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, unfortunately, earnings are lower. And we've got a pretty big municipal portfolio and, obviously, that higher
tax exempted income drives down the tax rate. And we would have had a low effective tax rate for the quarter
have we not had that $2.6 million credit, but it would have been a tax expense. But with that, that brought us into
the negative territory. So, now, there's nothing unusual other than the $2.6 million discrete item that's going
through the second quarter.

Okay. And then, finally from me, I know on last quarter's call, we talked about the full-year net interest margin for
you, guys, being a little above 3%. I mean, now that we're one more quarter into the year, I mean, does that still
feel like the right NIM level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A

still comfortable with that.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 30-Jul-2020
Our energy reserve is about $40.8 million, so that's about a 2.86% coverage. That's down from the 6.58% that we
had in the second quarter. Phil mentioned, we had about $35 million in charge-offs related to energy in the
quarter. And then, also obviously, with the CECL allowance calculation that we did if you recall, I know Phil
mentioned it in his comments. When we did just the allowance calculation last quarter, we were looking at oil at
$9. And obviously, we've got a huge improvement during the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Right,. So, I guess, I had that at a little over $100 million last quarter. So, with the $35 million charge-offs, you
effectively released, I guess, what, $28 million roughly? Is that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
That'd be about right, yeah. Exactly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Okay. Got you. Appreciate that. And then, what are you guys seeing for new loan yields overall and securities
purchase yields at this point in the quarter? Just with lower rates and everything, I was just curious where you're
seeing those yields come in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Unfortunately, on the security side, there's not a whole lot out there. I think we did purchase about $200
million during the quarter of mortgage backs, I think, and we were about $151 million. So, no, nothing great, but
certainly better than the 10 basis points we were earning at the Fed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
And our loan yields have been pretty consistent with previous quarters. So, we're seeing less usage of LIBOR,
which is good, given its going away but – and we're seeing a little bit of an increase in the fixed component with
people taking advantage of the current rate environment. But I'd say, they're fairly consistent.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Okay. So, if I back out the PPP fees from this quarter, I'd probably be closer to where the average is going
forward effectively. I mean, are you looking for any more loans yield pressure ex-PPP just given what you're
seeing in the market, the price market?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I'm sorry. What did you ask about PPP, I couldn't hear?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 30-Jul-2020
Oh, sure. I was just saying excluding PPP, given loan yields this quarter and what you're seeing currently in the
market, are you expecting any more loan yield pressure going forward? Or are you expecting the loan yields to be
relatively stable from here excluding PPP?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think it depends on what you have in have maturities versus – on the fixed side versus what is being put
back on that. I don't – it's not the topic that we're talking about a lot on. We expect to see of a lot of compression
there. I think the interesting things that – thing is going to be what we're seeing as the replacement for LIBOR we
continue to move forward through 2021, but [indiscernible] (00:25:59).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Okay. And then, maybe just one last one on the fee side. Just curious how much fee waiver has impacted service
charges and the other charge lines and what the outlook on that is going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
The fee waivers actually are a huge part of the second quarter run rate. Really, they were in the tail end of the first
quarter. And maybe, the first month of the second quarter, we did see higher levels. But really, what we saw in the
quarter was just really a lower run rate.
What I will say is as we looked at those on a monthly basis, I will say that June and into July are stronger than we
achieved in April and May. So, I'm feeling a little positive there. The uncertainty, of course, is everything that's
going on with the pandemic, seems to be more pressure with the masks and the stay at home. But for what we
saw in June, it was certainly stronger than April and May; and early into July, even a little bit better there.

[indiscernible] (00:27:26) as you know, we did use – so what happened obviously, as you recall, the prices were
changing so much at the end of the quarter. The first quarter, Moody's really couldn't keep up, and so we ended
up doing our own internal stress test. I think in the case of this quarter, what we did was we used the Moody's
price which is $26 a barrel for the second quarter of 2020, and then moving up to $32 through the fourth quarter
of this year, and then $42 onto 2021.

that we use the Moody's consensus scenario. And so, that one if you recall is one that talks about GDP going
down 23.5% in the second quarter, rebounds in the third quarter; unemployment rate about 15% in the second
quarter, improving to about 10% by the fourth quarter. And then, I think Texas, Texas is a little bit better there.
So, really, so if you want to go through the specifics of it, I guess the net decrease in the allowance of $9 million, I
think a lot of it was an increase in the – yeah, so that is kind of what was happening from an economic standpoint.
I think the economy was better. I think that one thing that was different this time for us was really on the
commercial real estate portfolio. Because the commercial real estate portfolio, for us, really ended up being a lot
more sensitive to the volatility and the forecasted technical employment rate and the forecasted US GDP. And so,
[ph] the model is very good (00:29:31) for our commercial real estate portfolio. It's about 107% higher than the
model rate for our C&I portfolio. And we tend to believe that the loss rate for our owner-occupied commercial real
estate and our C&I should be similar, both are underwritten with the assumption that the primary repayment
source is the cash flow from the operations of the borrower. So, that's probably the one area where the model, in
and of itself, was requiring a higher reserve. And then, based on the specifics of how our owner-occupied real
estate portfolio performs, we did make a reduction there.
I hope that answers your question [indiscernible] (00:30:17)...

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. That's helpful. And then, it looks like the COVID-sensitive loan exposures came down nicely quarter-over-
quarter. I think you called that $1.6 billion. Last quarter, you gave us the breakout of that in terms of energy,
restaurant, hotel, etcetera. Could you give us that breakdown of the $1.6 billion?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. And the $1.6 billion does not include energy. But what I'm showing is retail is about $783 million; hotels and
lodging, about $261 million; restaurants, $225 million; aviation, $194 million; and entertainment, $120 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q

Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
They have an combined allocated allowance of 2.52% at the end of June.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I'll just give you a little more detail on allowance by sector. So, the reserve for the restaurant component was at
4.34%. On the hotels, it's 1.21%. Reserve on sports and entertainment is 4.58%. Reserve on aviation was 2.8%.
And then, the reserve on total retail combined was 2.06%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's actually really helpful. If I could squeeze one more in, just following up on the tax rate. What's your
outlook for the tax rate for the second half? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. I mean, I think that adjusted 3.1% that I gave, that would have been the year-to-date rate without that
discrete item in the quarter. But I think it's something in that range. Obviously, it's pretty low now. I don't expect it
to go any lower. So, I'd say in that 3% to 5% range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Your net charge-off levels have been more elevated than as typical for Cullen over the last couple quarters. Are
you anticipating that will remain the case over the next two or three quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I'm not anticipating it. I mean, the thing that drove the charge-off, 80% of it or so, this quarter was really a
resolution of those loans I've been talking about that have been moving through the snake. Actually, it's been a
couple of years, maybe even three in one of the cases. Finally gotten to where one was completely sold off. The
other is down to a level that we feel pretty good about getting the remaining balance back. And it's under $10
million, so not pretty but those have been resolved.
The other credit that I've been talking about for the last several quarters is the largest one that other than the ones
that were on non-accrual at that time when I began talking about it. And you might recall, it was a company that
really needed to sell assets in order for its business model to work, and they were trying to do that in a situation
where capital had left the energy industry. So, it's very difficult for them to do that. And then, whenever you'd
layered on top of that the impacts that happened with COVID, it was very, very difficult for them. So, they ended
up – we ended up having charge-off on that credit. But I believe down to levels that, again, are very manageable.
So, I feel good about those were the three largest credits that we had to deal with, that they were the most
seriously impacted. So, those have been taken care of. There are a couple more that just as a result of the new
environment in energy that are out there, but they're not big a deal. So, I expect to see energy charge-offs not be
the same level as they were in the second quarter.
As I look forward on energy, I mean, I think we're going to see increases in problem loans, which we define as risk
grade 10 and higher. And I think the biggest impact of that in the second half is probably going to be in the service
area. Services is really a big area for us, it's about $200 million in round numbers. And so, if you take those
credits that are related more to the drilling component of it, that still hasn't come back even with a low $40 million
surprise. So, I think that's where you'll probably see the increase in problem loans. And we just have to see with
regard to – if there are charge-offs there.
Good thing about it is that people that we've met have generally been through multiple cycles. And I recall, service
component of our component into the last downturn 2014 through 2016 actually performed better than the
production side which was [indiscernible] (00:35:32).

So, anyway, that broadly was saying, I don't expect the charge-offs to be the same level based upon the fact that
so many of those were those legacy energy credits that we've cleaned up. But, Jennifer, we're going to have to
see what happens with the pandemic, see whether or not they close things down again. It's – nobody really knows
the answer going forward, but that's what I feel right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thank you. And of the $674 million in those greater at risk sectors, how much of that $674 million is in the energy,
restaurant, hotel, aviation, entertainment and retail?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think that $674 million might be the retail part of that fees. The total of all the credits in those segments that we
named excluding energy was, I think, $1.6 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
But I guess I'm sorry, I'm not being clear. So, of your $674 million in problem loans, right, is the vast majority of
those loans in those sectors you mentioned?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Let me take a quick look and see if I can. Actually, Jennifer, at this point, no. I mean, I'm just looking at the
problem loans. This would be on commitments for those sectors. So, if you look at problems in restaurants be,
and these are round numbers, around $23 million. Problems on hotels are $8 million. Problems on sports and
entertainment, around $7 million. Problems on aviation, $44 – no, excuse me, about $6 million, sorry. Problems
on retail, all totaled, look like around, say, just under $40 million. Problems on – and that's pretty much it. So, the
problems are spread around in different areas in there. I got...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I don't know. I think you said that the energy problem loans are about $177 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
So, you add all that together, compared to $600 million midyear, you're going to get a good portion of it. But I
wouldn't call it the vast majority.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
And the other thing I wanted to give a little clarity on was our management overlay on energy. So, our price deck
is, to get that out there, for 2020 oil is $30; for 2021 is $36; for 2022 is $40; and then, for 2023 is $45. And then,
we stretch that at 75%, it's how we came up with our management overlay in energy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
And, Jennifer, just to be clear. I think problems are going to increase. I mean, just as things – if we go deeper into
this pandemic. And problems won't necessarily equal losses. I mean, a problem means you get to a risk rate [ph]
10% (00:38:53).
For example, take hotels, I expect to see some increases in hotel problems, mainly because there were a couple
of those – if you look at that segment, I think we've got in round numbers 21 as I recall, 21 different properties.
And seven were construction, let's say a third were construction. And a couple of them moved out from
construction into operation. And you know, we'll move those to problems until we see how they go. And they're
probably not going to open until you could be confident, say, a 15% occupancy number. That's when we're finding
that hotels are opening. They could cover overhead around 35%, again, producing some cash flow at 50%.
And so, as those come into out of construction, we're going to immediately move those to problems. So, that
doesn't necessarily mean no big issues. But they're – in our view, they should be considered problems as we look
at how they're doing in the early part of their operating status. So, that's just one example.
Restaurants, we're going to have to see how that continues to go. I think, [indiscernible] (00:40:11) Jerry said, I'd
think that the problems there are going to be ones which are fine dining where you have to sit down, the premium
casual, and then probably the other in the small places, we probably got $100 million of that kind of thing. Again,
restaurant problems haven't been that large, but we continue to see those problems continue to increase as the
pandemic goes longer and longer.
So, I want to be [indiscernible] (00:40:44) the problems to increase. We really do think they're manageable. And
as I've said many times, it's kind of important what to do there in a crisis, but it's not nearly as important as what
you do before the crisis. And I feel good about the disciplines that we've had in place, not that we won't make
mistakes and you've seen the energy numbers that we reported where we've got to make mistakes and have
made them. But I feel really good about the way that we've done our business going into this cycle, because it's
really hard to get your way out of it if you had – than you were going to enter.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Just I want to ask about the PPP fees beyond the 20%. I think most banks that we look at, basically, would expect
to accelerate the PPP fees when they actually get paid off, which I agree with you likely in the fourth quarter to a
good chunk of them. But if you're recognizing 20% of the fees this quarter and presumably 20 % over the next two
quarter to your 60%, does that imply that when the loan a forgiven that you would see zero accelerated
amortization of those PPP fees?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. It would have to be pretty significant to affect that, because it's going to be pretty ratable. We kind of
assume an average life of [indiscernible] (00:42:20) is really accelerating. But we do expect a big chunk of it to
pay off in the third – late third and into fourth quarter of this year. So, we expect those balances to go down quite
a bit. But yeah, I think that we wouldn't necessarily see a huge peak in the recognition because of a huge amount
of forgiveness, if you will. But it could be accelerated, let's say, if they evolve all of a sudden the average life that
we're assuming which is 24 months. If that were a lot shorter, yeah, then that could be accelerated. I currently
don't expect that to happen. There's a lot of unknowns, obviously, out there associated with the portfolio. We do
expect that a big part of the forgiveness will happen after that 24-week period. But again, as Phil mentioned in his
comments, I mean, we are working on helping the customers through that forgiveness process.
But I have to be honest, some of the things that I have seen for others [ph] to me and all (00:43:20) across the
board on how people recognizing those fees. In my mind, ours really wasn't more aggressive than others. And in
fact, it was less aggressive than some of the ones that I saw. But obviously, we feel good about where we're at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And is it right to assume that you'll recognize another 20% in each of 3Q and 4Q for the fees?

there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And heaven forbid, but if those loans actually don't get forgiven and they get pushed out, what happens to
the fees, because it seems like you would have recognized all the revenues upfront or beforehand?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Maybe just a slightly different question. In terms of expenses, the 6% new growth rate year-over-year, it's
just doing back of the envelope numbers, it looks like that put your expenses, I think, back in the – if got my
numbers right – call it, the [ph] $220 million (00:44:35) range? Let me make sure I got this. Yeah, the [ph] $225
million to $230 million (00:44:38) range, is that kind of where you're thinking about for the next couple quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I guess, first, Jerry, just very quickly as a follow-up on the margin. So, I guess I heard you say you expect the full-
year margin to be slightly over 3% ex all things PPP. But could you tell us the amount of security that are coming
up for maturity over the back-half of the year? And I'm assuming that the yields on the maturing cash flows are
about 3%. And what I'm trying to get to is, it seems like the margin will be somewhere in the [ph] 290s (00:45:44)
by the time we exit 2020, with additional slight pressure beyond that. So, just want to make sure we capture that
correctly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think that we've got – I think that a big part of it is here in the third quarter. If we look at our cash flow from
we had some agencies that were maturing in July. So, I'm thinking we're around $600 million, $750 million
between now and the end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And is there any component of the deposits that came in 2Q that you expect to leave the bank which may
be beneficial to the margin in terms of excess liquidity leaving?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Obviously, we're a little bit of an unprecedented time here. Some of it, we do expect – some of the increase
we do think is associated with those PPP loans. And although it appears that some of it's getting parked, you
would expect that some of that will get spent out. Our modeling assumptions indicate that we do see some of it
going on. We're not comfortable disclosing how much at this point.
But really, to be honest with you, it's tough to tell. They continue to grow. When we look at the 12-month look back
on deposits, really, about 85% of our growth both on the consumer side and the commercial side is really from our
own customer augmentation. And we continue to have good growth from new customers, about 15%. But at this
point, it really gets tough. So, I think there's just a lot of uncertainty. People are being obviously more careful with
19


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 30-Jul-2020
their money. And we haven't really – didn't really see a big decrease related to tax payments or anything that I've
seen at this point. But obviously, with the pushback, we'd expected some movement down in July.
So, I think it's a little bit hard to tell. I think we're all kind of trying to grapple with what's going to go on with
deposits. We've never been one to shy away from accepting deposits. Obviously, we like the fact that a lot of the
new relationships that Phil mentioned, in some cases, are going to start with deposits. But I think our growth from
a standpoint of compared to the second quarter last year, if I remember correctly, 70% it is really commercial
DDA, which we're not paying any interest on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And I guess if I could ask one question, Phil, just in term with – I guess it's tied to credit. But when you look
at the environment today across your markets in Texas, just talk to us around like do you have a sense of
confidence that things get better? Like did you see things deteriorate [ph] intra-quarter (00:48:18) and like some of
the COVID cases increase in Texas? And how do you see this playing out vis-à-vis [ph] going to align (00:48:25)
when Texas actually outperformed quite nicely given what we are seeing with COVID, given what we are seeing
with the energy sector? Just give us a big picture view of how to think about how the economy might play out over
the next 12 months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, I think the view of the economy over the last 12, I kind of stated some – the economies, on the other hand,
economy, there are some parts of it that are doing well. We talked to both dealers, we talked to the customer
there. We've got a large – both dealer have been around since the 1970s, had their best month for their history in
May. Automobile dealers have been around for generations, best month in history in May. [ph] Diamond
(00:49:20) distributors up 25% in May year-over-year.
There are a number of areas like that. If you look at the heavy equipment dealer, that's – if you look at the parts of
their business that are not related to energy, they're still positive, there's lots of roadwork going on, there's lots of
construction going on. On the other hand, you've got anything related to the energy piece is pretty much dead
because that relates to sort of the [ph] service fracking piece. (00:49:56)
So, you've good pipelines from customers as we talk to them on the construction side through November. On the
other hand, there's concern that with the municipal and fiscal situations at state and local levels that you may see
reductions in construction and roadwork and those kind of things because of the focus on basic services. So, the
pipelines going into 2021, there's some concern on that. And you're seeing – you got the energy piece, which
we've been talking about, which has improved greatly up to $40 or so north of that. On the other hand, you're
really not seeing any drilling right now, so the service side is going to be weak. And it's going to depend I think –
just being a participant in Texas right now, sort of how the authorities decide to handle the situation with cases
increasing. I think there's a lot of activity. People are using mask. I mean, usually you'd go into a grocery store
before, I'd say three, four weeks ago, maybe two-thirds of the people have mask on. You go to a place today, you
almost never see anyone without one. And so, some of the local authorities I've talked to here realized that our
hand has been dealt over the last three weeks or so, past Memorial – and then also past Memorial Day because
of what happened with infections and without a mandatory mask situation. But now that people have been more
careful, there's hope that that's going to help the situation going forward.
So, I think that the next six months are going to be probably just heavy lifting on, just grinding through the general
economic impacts on the portfolio. And hopefully, we won't be sitting here in the same situation. At the end of the
20

first quarter having done this, because I think some of these businesses, these smaller businesses, et cetera, are
going to run out of steam without some kind of continued fiscal stimulus.
So, I know that's not definitive. Truth is nobody knows, but there are some positive things going on. But, on the
other hand, there are negative things that we're all dealing with. And I think at end of the day, this really relates to
some kind of medical solution either through really effective therapeutics or through some kind of vaccine, and
that's what we're hoping for.

base those numbers on. We're 143% ahead on relationships, so call it 150% ahead of target on relationships.
We're slightly below target on total deposits. We're about 83% of target on deposits today, but the momentum is
positive going forward. And then on loans, we're 200% plus of our target on the lending side. So, I think we're
ahead of those numbers that we were assuming that we gave when we entered into the program, and things have
been going better than we expected.
One thing I'll point out is that half of the new relationships that we're experiencing in the Houston market are
related to the expansion effort. And new relationship growth in Houston year-over-year is up 40%. And I also think
that Houston is the only market we have for loan opportunities are positive versus a year ago.
And so, not only are the branches performing better, but I think there's some overall impact in the entire market
that's benefiting from the effort. So, I'd say sometimes in the heat of battle, the fog of war, it's hard to focus on
what are you doing right for the long-term. I'm very excited and pleased with the expansion strategy. And I think
these numbers have shown that we're going to reach this breakeven numbers faster and the impact is going to be
less than we anticipated.

That's very helpful. On the expenses, Jerry, you keep lowering that expense guidance. And you last quarter, you
put more focus on discretionary expenses and hiring, and then the benefit with these stay-at-home restrictions.
What are some of the drivers that you're able to lower that expense growth target again this quarter?

Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think this quarter, some of what we're dealing with, and you hit the nail on the head. A big part of it obviously, the
run rate is much lower and without knowing how that turns around or when it turns around, we just thought it
made sense to lower our guidance. But I think if I look at travel, meals, entertainment, that sort of stuff compared
to the second quarter of last year, it's probably down $3 million. Marketing expenses this quarter were down quite
a bit. We do expect that those will go up in the second quarter. We kind of slowed down some of the things we're
doing. But we want to continue to have our name out there. Phil talked a little bit about our Net Promoter Scores,
and we're very sensitive to what's going on in Houston. So, I envision we'll spend some dollars there.
There's some discretionary stuff that we can do associated with performance. Obviously, it's not a great year. So,
that's coming into the reduction that we're projecting here and really just looking for ways to be efficient. There's a
lot of things that we learned. Phil talked about our success on the PPP program. I mean, a lot of that we couldn't
have done without really improving some of our back office processes. And that team really, through IT and
through our operations area, put lot of processes in place to automate a lot of things. So, our expectations are
that we'll be able to continue to do some improvements there, but we're really being careful. I mean, I think the
team overall is really sensitive to the revenue challenge that we're in.
So, we're taking a look at every position. If somebody leaves or retires, we're asking ourselves whether that
position needs to be replaced, and really just asking everybody to question every dollar that they spend to be
quite honest with you. And again, there are some discretionary incentive sort of type cost in there that are also
affecting those dollars.

reduction capacity and kind of the – obviously, you have some momentum in Houston. But how should we think
about loan growth as move forward? Thanks.

Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Michael, it's hard to say on loan growth. It seems like we've just been in the PPP business for the last two months.
Although we had seen some growth and I think our pipeline, as I mentioned, was up somewhat in the third
quarter, going into the third quarter, although that's – some of that is deals that were pushed forward into that
quarter. If you look at the – give me just one second. I think that we could see some growth in the third, but it's
really hard to [ph] get this built (00:59:13) on what it's going to be after that, because we just don't know what kind

of activity businesses are going to undertake until they get some more visibility on the health issues. So, I think
high-single digits has always been our goal for loan growth. I'm going to expect it's going to be lower than that
until we get some visibility on what's going happen medically and what's going on with the economy. I wish I had
a better answer for you, but we're still [ph] working on that. (00:59:42)

As we think about the reserve at this point, we've had a lot of banks talk about the heavy [ph] reserve going being
done. (00:59:56) How do you guys think about that? It looks like the reserve was down ex-PPP? How should we
think about reserve levels at this point? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Michael, I think what we did, which doesn't surprise me, it's been my experience. This is what we do. We hit it
really hard really early. So, if you look at the first quarter, I mean, we had $175 million reserve. We built the
numbers up. We had a much smaller amount in the second quarter really because of it. But if you look at the first
half of the year and look at the numbers that we've provided, I think that we were representative of people who
are doing their business the right way. I feel good about that.
The question is going to be what happens going forward, and that's just going to depend on the health situation I
think. And I think we're going to see some increases in problems, but how [indiscernible] (01:01:09). I don't know
how the CECL thing is going to play out. I mean, it is what it is. That also creates uncertainty, what the model are
going to say, what are the complications going to be.
I feel pretty good about where we are and about where our situation is with the reserve. I'm not going to say it
won't increase if things get worse. And it also could – we could see provisions go way down if the models and the
situation indicates that things are continuing to improve. So, [ph] it's kind of like longer (01:01:47) but I wish I had
a better answer, but there's so much uncertainty, right?
Jerry, any thoughts on CECL?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No. I mean, I think you hit the nail on the head. I think right now, obviously, we feel good about where we're at. A
lot of it just depends on what the second half of the year looks like. I think if things were to return – take a turn for
the worse, obviously we did have expectations that if things would increase, that that reserve would increase, but
right now we feel good about it.

A lot of work is done both on the commercial real estate side. We've got the credit guys meeting with our
relationship managers weekly just like they do on the energy portfolio. So, we're trying to stay ahead of all of that.
But we can't really control what happens to the economy related to the pandemic effect. If something happens
there, we could see some challenges.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think Jerry made a really good point there that we've established – I mean, again, it's not our first rodeo. And so,
we put in place counsels and energy counsel that reviews. I think we're reviewing basically 90% of all the energy
relationships on the production side, 85% to 90%, probably higher now on the service side, meets every week. It
used to be for three hours. It's down to where it's probably half that time now. We've established a commercial
real estate counsel as well that's doing the same thing on a weekly basis going through the credits. The
relationship managers are responsible for communicating with customers, communicating back in terms of what
they're saying. We need to understand the sustainability of their cash flow. We need to understand their plans and
the effectiveness they're having on executing those plans. There's just as tremendous amount of work being done
communicating with customers and understanding our situation.
I'll tell you though, I sit in on those. I'd like to monitor those as much as I can, and I'm always encouraged [ph]
going away from it (01:03:45) just because of the ability of our customers to execute and their willingness to and
our relationship managers their ability to understand and have these relationships with the customers. I'll tell you
another thing that I feel good about just anecdotally is, as you talk to people about credits and listen to people
explain what's going on with their credits, I sure am glad that we put as much focus as we do on guarantees and
on structures on those deals. It makes a big difference when you're [ph] reading that right up (01:04:19) and you
get to the end and it's guaranteed and the people that are supporting it. That's what I mean by – it's really
important the decisions you make going into the crisis more so than what you do during the crisis because now
we're in it.
But I feel good about the way we're handling the credits, where our people are operating. And I feel good about
how our customers are performing. Again, not that we won't have problems and not that they won't increase, but I
feel that we did a good job of handling things across [indiscernible] (01:04:50) going into this.

I appreciate the color. Just one last question. So, if I look at pre-tax pre-provision earnings with a lower margin, I
mean, when do you guys think that you will stabilize? And I know you didn't give the fiscal EPS guidance because
the ranges are very wide at this point. But, I mean, on a pre-tax pre-provision basis, I mean, when do you think we
kind of bottomed? Is it the next quarter or two and then you grow? Obviously, I understand the investment in
Houston and everything that's going on at this point, but just from a guide perspective, I mean, when do you think
we hit the bottom? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think we hit the bottom [indiscernible] (01:05:38) situation because we know that – and businesses are able to
move forward. I mean, that's really it. I mean, there's some political uncertainty because it's an election here, so
we can't forget about that. But, I mean, the big deal is COVID and the impact on the economy and on people and
that's it. And so, I'm telling, so I don't know the answer to your question.

Just a couple of follow-ups. The deferral numbers that you gave, it sounds like you have $1.1 billion left. Any

Jon, we don't have any indication that it will be right now. So now, I mean, I'm not saying it won't be, but that's not

Pipeline comments, you've made quite a few, but how does the pipeline compare say where you were at the end

Phillip D. Green A

You know, if you look at versus a year ago, I happen to have that handy. So, the pipeline, the gross pipeline was
up 8% and that's not weighted. And as I've mentioned, it's not on linked quarter basis, 24%, but versus last year,
it's up 23%.

Jon Arfstrom Q

Is it fair – you're talking about some construction projects, is it narrower or is it starting to broaden out
[indiscernible] (01:08:01)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
If you look at the pipeline, commercial and industrial is weaker, and you'd expect that it's flat to down. 10% of the
growth in the pipeline is in commercial real estate and also consumer, and consumer real estate. Our consumer I
haven't really talked much, but our consumer pipeline is up 58% on a linked quarter basis. It's up 138% from last
year. Now, those aren't huge numbers. That growth is about 10% of what you see in the commercial or the
commercial real estate side. So, that's a positive. So, is it narrower? Probably. And right now it's more oriented
towards commercial real estate and in consumer real estate. And we're not going to see much pipeline in the
energy space, right, because we're moderating our exposure there as we've talked about for a long time.

Last one I have maybe more big picture. But in an odd way, it seems like this environment is actually good for you

Sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer/Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sorry. Teams, Microsoft Teams, that's right. And they're not terrible. They're a little awkward. Sometimes you
have technology issues and all, but you're still getting to see people. We're getting used to it, but we're kind of
bumping our way along. I think the thing that really gave us the biggest push was just PPP. And you can say, well,
[ph] how much is your PPP loans (01:10:38) for customers? How are you getting [indiscernible] (01:10:42)
customers if you didn't do their loans? People are so frustrated with some of the experiences that they have had.
And we got a lot of good reputational word of mouth on the experience people have with us, and it's been great. I
mean, our numbers of new relationships, we report them every week. And we've seen them grow from probably
30-ish to 100-ish a week for the last seven, eight weeks. And that's really notable, and a big percentage of those
are related to PPP. So, that's good.
I will say this, it's amazing to me how competitive it still is. Just to give you an example, take commercial real
estate funding, we lost – I gave you the total deals that we lost to structure. But if you look at just CRE, so we lost
in 2019 68% of the deals that we lost, we lost at structure. In 2020, this year, 92% of the deals we've lost we've
lost a structure. So, it's amazing to me that you're still seeing some aggressiveness in structure in this market. So,
as far as the competitive situation, it really hasn't cleared up yet.
But I think that we are – this is kind of the time that's good for us. We tend to be a stable force. In terms of
providing capital, we don't move in and out too much. We kind of stay in the middle and people know that about
us. Our reputation on PPP has been great. I think it's really helped us out in Houston where we've been growing.
So, that's some good stuff.
I think there's some – I agree with you, there's some positives in this market for us taking share. But there's a lot
of work that we've got to do to get there. And I will say one other thing, which we've talked about. I think it's harder
to move business over in this situation because people are just kind of hunkered down. And so, that may make
that a little bit more difficult. But that's the lay of the land right now competitively.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you. Just wanted to follow-up on the investment securities portfolio. The yields ticked a little bit
higher in 2Q, I was surprised. And given your commentary around the upcoming maturities, it sounds like you're
saying that security deals should see a material decline I think in the back half of the year. Is that right? And then
if so, how should we think about the magnitude of declines in security deals?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I haven't really addressed the significance of the decline. I don't know [indiscernible] (01:13:54) coming off at what
rate. That improvement really between the first and the second quarter, some of it was really – we had some
27


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 30-Jul-2020
maturities of – some tactical securities that were below or I guess we had a sale or two of some securities that
were below the average yield, so that kind of pumped up the yield in the second quarter compared to the first.
I think that, obviously for anything that's maturing right now, yeah, it's really difficult to find any sort of – anything
out there along the yield curve. So, it's just going to be our guide, just continuing to see what we can look at. We
will spend some of our liquidity. I think I said we spent about $200 million of it in the second quarter. Not a great
rate there though, at 1.5%, but we're going to take a look at that and we'll probably spend a little bit more in the
latter half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Jerry, are there any large or chunky maturities that you see in the back of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, I think that they're all pretty ratable. We did have a – let me see if I've got the yield on this year. I guess, we
had – hold on a second, bear with me, let me get my notes here. So, I guess, we had – in the first quarter, we had
quite a bit of, that we likely talked about, maturity in sales [ph] on the treasuries (01:15:26) portfolio.
In the second quarter, really there wasn't that – I don't have any sort of size associated with it. I think we had
really matched our sales and our purchases pretty evenly. I think we had $200 million maturing in the second
quarter and replaced it with $200 million. The yield I saw on the munis, for example, about $50 million of it was
munis, and that was coming off at about $279 million. So, yes, there's nowhere we can find anything like that right
now. But that $279 million is really the only comparable. I can give you that that matured in the second quarter.
