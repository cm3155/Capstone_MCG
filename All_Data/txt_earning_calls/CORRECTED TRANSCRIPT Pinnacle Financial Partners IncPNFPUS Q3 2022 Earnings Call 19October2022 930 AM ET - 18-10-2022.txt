M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, Paul, and thank you for joining us this morning for the third quarter earnings call. As I'm confident
you've already seen, third quarter was another fabulous quarter for us. Last quarter, in my introductory comments,
I tried to list a number of themes that I believe are critical in order to not only understand the financial
performance for the quarter, but really to better ascertain how the firm should perform going forward despite the
varying operating environments we might encounter.
As a quick reminder, those overarching themes that I mentioned last quarter and which I think you'll see are
interwoven again in this quarter's numbers. Number one, management's motivated and incented to alter
outcomes given various market conditions. As an example, we don't just accept the current asset sensitivity or we
don't just accept what the current overall market growth rates; we set about to alter outcomes based on our
actions and initiatives.
A lot of people are chasing all kinds of interesting metrics like deposit cost betas, and I get it. But specifically, the
outcomes that we're motivated and intended to optimize at Pinnacle are the level of classified assets, PPNR
growth and EPS growth in the case of annual cash incentive plan and tangible book value accretion and ROTCE
in the case of the long-term equity incentive plan. And so, understanding that will likely help you understand
things like, why we've accreted tangible book value in a year when many have not.
Number two, we enjoy a reputation for having a great culture, but our culture isn't just fun and soft up. Any
number of studies have demonstrated statistically valid correlations between a social engagement and important
outcomes like reduced associate turnover, improved productivity, improved profitability, better sales outcome, and
total shareholder returns. And nothing is more important in the war for talent. And so, I think that helps explain
things like, why we continue to hire record numbers of the best bankers and financial services professionals at a
time many are short staffed and suffering lower social engagement and high turnover.
Number three, our hiring success over the last several years is the single largest contributor to our balance sheet
growth and ongoing momentum. It explains where so much of our loan and deposit growth comes from. And not
only that, because of the level of experience of our new hires is equal to or greater than 20 years, we believe we
can grow assets without sacrificing our commitment to credit quality. It's much different than those that are trying
to grow by increasing the frequency of their call program.
In fact, in Greenwich Research, we're at or near the top on virtually every sales and service metric that they
typically view as important with one notable exception, and that's prospect calling, where we are dead last. That's
just not how we get our business, as opposed to forcing RMs to make prospect calls. In our case, long
experienced bankers typically move long-standing relationships, which we believe over the long haul results in a
meaningfully different credit profile.
And number four, BHG is not your typical fintech. Its ability to attract loans from high-quality borrowers with very
high yields and get them funded through their proprietary bank auction platform, or alternately securitizing them in
the secondary market when many cannot, continues to result in the kind of income that lets us significantly invest

in people to seize all the market opportunities that exist for us, while continuing to put up top quartile profitability.
I'm not aware of anyone who's been able to invest in their business model to the extent that we have, while
remaining extremely profitable.
As I've already alluded, we believe metrics like asset quality, revenue growth, earnings per share, and tangible
book value accretion result in long-term shareholder returns. That's why our incentives are linked to them, and
that's why we show this dashboard quarter in and quarter out where you can see the relentless upward slope of
things like revenues, earnings per share, and the balance sheet volumes that produce that growth.
On asset quality, we've been living in literally the best of times. We fully expect the asset quality metrics to more
normalize going forward, but you can see that NPAs and classified assets continue to operate at extraordinary
lows, as do charge-offs at just 16 basis points. In fact, we've been in the top quartile in terms of NPAs to Tier 1
capital and classified assets to Tier 1 capital for some time. And given the continued reductions on those metrics
this quarter, I'd be shocked if we aren't there again when we're able to construct the peer metrics for the third
quarter.
As most of you know, given the very commercial nature of our loan book, charge-offs are generally lumpy. We
had one of those this quarter, which Harold will talk more about in a moment. But again, credit metrics continue to
be extraordinary. I won't spend much time on the non-GAAP measures, at least not as much time as I usually do,
because the idea is that virtually all the important growth and earnings metrics are up and to the right, generally
well exceeding market expectations, and painting a picture of what's been a beat-and-raise story for quite some
time.
As I just mentioned, the talent that we've added over the last several years results in extraordinary balance sheet
momentum. As we did last quarter, we're again dissecting net loan growth based on the categories noted on the
slide to help everyone better understand the source of our growth. We've again categorized our growth into four
broader segments.
Number one, our pure asset generation plays like BHG, Advocate Capital, JB&B Leasing. B, our strategic market
expansions which are not only the geographies like Atlanta, DC, Birmingham, and so forth; but also expansions in
the specialty lending groups like franchise and equipment lending. C, growth from our recruiting over the last 2.5
years. So, this is the growth of our newer RMs that have been with us for only 2.5 years or less and that are not
included in our strategic expansion markets. And then finally, D, our legacy markets and what they contributed
from RMs that have been with us more than 2.5 years.
So, thus far, through the first nine months, we've experienced 24.5% EOP loan growth annualized between
December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022 which is inclusive of PPP pay-downs which are denoted in red on
the slide. Almost 46% of our $4.3 billion in net loan growth is from our legacy markets, while the rest is primarily
from new markets, new initiatives, and new people.
We've said that â€“ we've said this countless times. We think we're in many of the best banking markets in the
Southeast. Many of you know that for lenders to come to work for us, they have to have at least 10 years of
experience in our markets; and on average, it's more like 20 years. So, to characterize all this loan growth as new
loans is a little bit of a stretch as these borrowers have been working with our 10-year-plus experienced lenders
for years. The loans are just new to PNFP.
We get asked frequently about how the new markets and specialties are performing. I simply want to get you this
information where you can see that we're having extraordinary success, moving talent and clients to the Pinnacle

platform. For those that struggle with the value, the emphasis we place on culture, here's just one of the examples
of where it pays off. Putting associates in a position where they can serve their clients well is what enables us to
attract the best associates, as well as their clients.
I know everyone is aware that the annual FDIC deposit market share information was released in the third
quarter. Here, you can see, first of all, we're in great markets as evidenced by the rate of deposit growth in the
market, and that'll be an important success variable going forward. But more importantly, we've been able to grow
our deposits faster than the market, which is just another way of saying we've had great success moving market
share.
Many are concerned with the shrinking M2 and the impact that could have on funding, and so I would say I don't
think we could grow anywhere near the pace that we currently grow if we were unable to take deposit share from
these larger, more vulnerable banks in our markets. Harold will comment further on our deposit growth in a
minute.
A couple of slides we've used from time to time. What you're looking at here is data from Greenwich Associates,
the foremost provider of commercial market research to large banks in the United States. Virtually all the top 50
banks in the country purchase this same data. So, I would say it's universally accepted by all our primary
competitors. It's based on client responses across our entire footprint, meaning businesses with annual sales from
$1 million to $500 million in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Atlanta, and Roanoke.
So, let's focus on the Pinnacle line at the bottom of the Small Business Net Promoter chart, which is on the top left
of the slide. You see in the navy blue portion of the bar that 76% of the Pinnacle client survey rated us a 9 or a 10
on the question, how likely are you to recommend your lead provider to a friend or colleague using a scale of 0 to
10 where 0 means not likely at all and 10 means extremely likely? In other words, 76% of our clients are highly
engaged active promoters. Trust me, that's an extremely unusual level of engagement. Another 22% rated us a 7
or 8. That's not bad. Combining the two, 98% of our clients rated us 7 or better on a 10-point scale. But that 22%,
that gold portion of the bar, scoring us a 7 or 8 are referred to as passive because while they generally rate you
well, they're not really so fired up as to be vocal advocates for you in the market. And then the last 2%, the red
portion of the bar, are detractors. Meaning, they rated you somewhere between 0 and 6. And out beside the bar,
you see a 74. That's the Net Promoter Score or the number of promoters less the number of detractors.
As you can see, that score is wildly differentiated from all our major competitors in our footprint. And not only is
that a fabulous Net Promoter Score in the Southeast, according to Greenwich, it's one of the best in the country.
And the story is the same, only better among middle market businesses on the lower right of the slide where you
can see our Net Promoter Score is 81.
Now, you might look at the percentage of detractors for each of our major competitors. That red portion on each
of their bars. And keep in mind, the banks are generally listed in market share order. So, as you can see, all the
top three banks in our footprint have enormous volumes of detractors. And that's the opportunity we have been
seizing for some time and expect to continue seizing.
So, if you think about the speed and reliability of our growth, which is largely dependent on taking share as
opposed to economic loan demand, this explains why we've been so successful taking share over the last 20
years, why we grew loans 20.9% on an annualized basis this quarter, why we grew core deposits 9.8% on an
annualized basis this quarter, and why I believe we'll continue to produce outsized growth for the foreseeable
future.

And it's not just that many of the banks with whom we compete have upset a great number of their clients, a large
percentage of their clients expressly intend to move some or all of their business away from them in the next 12
months. That group, the percentage of their clients who have expressly indicated their intent to move, is
represented by the blue bar. And happily, more than to any of the major banks with whom we compete, a large
percent of clients intend to increase their relationship with us meaningfully more.
My purpose in walking through this is really to tighten the linkage for you between our distinctive culture and the
revenue and the EPS growth. So, you don't have to just take a leap of faith that the distinctive culture we've been
building here over the last 22 years will mysteriously result in something good. You can actually connect the dots
with Greenwich data reflecting the actual client feedback to better understand the quality and sustainability of our
market share and revenue growth.
So, that's the 30,000-foot view. With that, I'll turn it over to Harold for a more in-depth review of the quarter.

Harold R. Carpenter
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. As usual, we will start with loans. The third quarter was another strong
loan growth quarter for us, with almost 22% linked-quarter EOP annualized growth. Our current pipeline support
low double-digit loan growth going into the fourth quarter, which would yield low 20% growth for this year. Loan
yields were up in the third quarter due primarily to rate hikes. We anticipate further escalation in loan yields with
rate increases in November and December. Our current planning assumption is for 75 basis points in November
and 50 basis points in December.
Since there were 150-basis-point hikes during the third quarter, we've not gotten the full effect of the third quarter
average rates noted on the slide. Given that and more increases in the fourth quarter, we anticipate fourth quarter
yields will be up 75 basis points to 90 basis points or so. As we sit here at the end of September, our loan yields
are around 5%. We've also talked about loan floors over the last several quarters, but we're essentially through
those, so we should capture a larger share of rate increases moving forward.
The bottom left chart summarizes our loan betas for 2022. We tracked each rate hike and what the beta results
were for each hike. The green bars are estimates as we don't have the full effect of the September rate hike yet
and we won't till we get to the November FOMC meeting when we will put a stake in the ground and remeasure
the September hike. Of course, November-December are based on our current planning assumptions, but we feel
somewhere around 60% loan beta is a reasonable target for us.
Now, on to deposits. Really pleased to report, call it, 10% linked-quarter annualized growth in deposits for the
third quarter. At present, our relationship managers are active deposit book protectors, as well as outbound
deposit seekers. So, it's like we've always said, it's about shoe leather at Pinnacle. It's about being in the
community and finding the funding at a reasonable price. We, like others, did experience some mix shift during
the quarter as EOP DDA balances are down from prior quarter, but average DDA balances were actually up for
the quarter.
We will keep our fingers crossed that this will hold. We are actively building out deposit gathering franchises
around HSA, community housing associations, nonprofits and others, where we target specific types of
organizations that are net providers of funding, and we believe we are making strong headway with these special
deposit initiatives. More to come as these initiatives continue to grow.

Everybody wants to know about deposit betas. The top right chart attempts to show what we're currently thinking.
This chart is constructed similar to the loan chart shown previously. Our planning assumption is that we think we
can hold with a 40% total deposit beta that we've been talking about since earlier in the year.
For the first 20-plus years of our existence, our number one objective was developing strategies and tactics
around funding our growth. We continue to like our chances given the significant investment we've made in both
the relationship managers and new markets over the last few years. We believe many other banks around the
country are reassessing their beta assumption as liquidity has gotten more difficult. As to Pinnacle, we have been
steadily investing in our deposit book all year long, and believe that our clients appreciate a pricing discipline that
is more fair in an upright environment in comparison to what we hear from others.
Hopefully, you'll not hear this bank leadership ever talk about having too many deposits. Depositors are just as, if
not significantly, more important than borrowers. Our belief is that we can and will fund our growth effectively and
prudently, maintaining the appropriate balance between profitability and growth, something we believe we have a
track record of accomplishing.
Now, the liquidity. Our liquid assets decreased slightly this quarter, but we continue to believe we have ample
liquidity to fund our near-term growth. As to investment securities, our allocation to bonds is anticipated to be
flattish in the fourth quarter. As the top left chart reflects with the rate upcycle, our GAAP NIM increased by 30
basis points compared to 28 basis points last quarter. So, we're pleased with this going into the fourth quarter.
Our planning assumption is that our NIM will likely top off in the first half of next year, assuming rate hikes stall or
are minimal in the first half of next year.
In summary, our belief is that we should see another quarter of NIM expansion along with increased net interest
income in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we are upping our guidance for net interest income growth to the low 20
percentage growth for the full year 2022 over last year.
As to credit, we are, again, presenting our traditional credit metrics. Pinnacle's loan portfolio continues to perform
very well. As Terry mentioned earlier, late in the quarter and into October, we had one previously classified C&I
credit weakened due primarily to an alleged failure of a supplier's defective part that had been installed in the
homes of our client's customers. We don't believe this was the result of all the economic headwinds that we are
all paying so much attention to. We recorded a partial charge-off effective September 30, placed the loan on
nonaccrual, pending more credit work. In spite of this one credit, we're pleased with where classified assets
ended, as evidenced by the almost three-year downward trend in our classified loan totals, as well as our past
dues, which are, again, at very conservative levels at quarter end.
Our current ACL is 1.04%, which, again, compares to a pre-CECL, pre-COVID reserve of 48 basis points at the
end of 2019. We previously thought our ACL for the quarter would have been less than 1.04%. But given the
events over the last month or so, we believe keeping the ACL flattish for us is appropriate right now. All of this
culminates in a larger provision expense than we anticipated at $27.5 million. We continue to have conversations
with borrowers about supply chains, labor inflation, and how it's impacting their businesses. We have been and
are all about sustainable credit diligence effort with the intent to actively identify any weaknesses in our borrowing
base.
We get many questions about what changes we are implementing as a result of the inflationary economy. A few
things worth mentioning here. We have substantially limited our appetite for new construction, whether it be
residential or commercial. We believe our book is very healthy with strong sponsors, but the macro environment
gives us a pause as to increasing our asset allocations to this segment. Our credit officers have increased our
7

due diligence in stress testing, particularly around supply chain impact, rates, and profitability. We're also
increasing our diligence around the traditional metrics of loan-to-value debt coverage, so on and so forth.
Now, on to fees and expenses. I won't spend a lot of time on fees or expenses. And as always, I will speak to
BHG in a few minutes. Third quarter fees are coming off of a record second quarter, so the optics are difficult. And
as a reminder, we did note last quarter that we thought we would see decreases in fees in the third quarter. All
that said, we are pleased with the effort our fee-generating units are putting forward. Service charges are
impacted by a change in how we charge NSFs and overdraft fees, which we announced in early July. We have
some reason to believe we will see a rebound in wealth management in the fourth quarter as a result of recent
hires.
Excluding BHG and barring any additional downdraft from our other equity investments, we're believing that we
are near floral fee this quarter, and that we should see a stronger fourth quarter fee result. Excluding BHG and the
impact of these other equity investments, we continue to believe that high single-digit growth for 2022 over 2021
is still in play.
As to expenses, we're increasing our overall total expense run rate to a high-teens percentage growth in 2022.
This increase is attributed to head count growth in the new markets; market disruption across our markets, which
has led to strong recruiting opportunities; and the addition of JB&B.
In addition, we continue to believe that we should achieve maximum payouts of 125% of target awards for our
annual cash incentive plan. But it's all about recruiting and our success in attracting the best bankers to our
franchise, which seems to be operating at peak capacity. Our third quarter non-compensation expense was fairly
flat with the second quarter, and we believe that the fourth quarter won't be that different from the prior two
quarters.
In conclusion, we had a strong hiring quarter in the third quarter, which was the reason for the increased salary
expense. We're anticipating another strong quarter of hiring in fourth quarter, although we don't anticipate the
increase will be as great in the fourth quarter as it was in the third quarter.
As the capital tangible book value increased to $42.44 at quarter end, up slightly from last quarter, our capital
ratios remain above well-capitalized levels. We like our tangible common equity ratio that stands at 8.3%
currently. We are mindful of our Tier 2 capital levels, particularly at Pinnacle Bank, in light of our exceptional
growth. And we'll be monitoring these levels and the debt markets as we head into the fourth quarter and into
2023. Aside from that, we believe the action we've taken to preserve tangible book value and our tangible capital
ratio, have served us well and have no plans to alter our Tier 1 capital stack via any sort of common or preferred
offering.
Now, a few comments about BHG before we look at the outlook for the rest of the year. BHG had a great quarter,
in our opinion, slightly better than we had anticipated. We're booking more than $41 million in fee revenues this
quarter and have increased our outlook for 2022 growth over 2021 to more than 25% from a projection of 15%
last quarter.
As the slide indicates, BHG had another record quarter on originations. Spreads have come in slightly lower than
last quarter from 9.8% to 9.7%, as the chart on the bottom left indicates. That's more than the amount BHG
anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. BHG does anticipate that auction platform spreads will come in slightly
as rates on the short end continue to rise. They anticipate that borrower rate should be approaching 17% by the
end of the year with bank buy rates moving into the 7% range.
8


Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
(PNFP) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
As a result, we anticipate that spreads will fluctuate within the historical ranges of 9% to 10% or so. That said,
we're really pleased with BHG's third quarter, as the third quarter again highlights their flexibility as to how they
can pivot between the bank network and securitizations to fund their loan growth.
Formally titled as the recourse obligation accrual, this slide now titled the accrual for loan substitutions and
prepayments, which stood at 5.28% of BHG's sold loan portfolio at September 30, which is more than the accrual
at June quarter end, as BHG increased its accrual from $235 million to $270 million at September 30.
As the blue bars on the bottom right chart show, the credit loss portion of recourse losses for the second quarter
remain at some of the lowest levels in the past 10 years. Additionally, given the macro environment, BHG also
increased its on-balance sheet reserve for loan losses to $101 million or 3.53% of on-balance sheet loans from
3% last quarter. Given the macro environment, we believe BHG will likely increase reserves, again going into the
fourth quarter and into 2023.
The quality of BHG's borrowing base, in our opinion, remains impressive and we believe one of their strongest
attributes. BHG refreshes its credit score monthly, always looking for weaknesses in its borrowing base. Credit
scores were at consistent levels with previous quarters, so their borrowers have remained resilient through the
cycle thus far.
As to past due trends, past dues greater than 30 days were at 1.52% at September 30 compared to 1.37% at
June 30 and 1.39% from a year ago. Past dues were at 1.77% at the end of December 2020. BHG's consistent
monitoring of its portfolio allows it to adjust its origination approvals quickly. They have, over the past few months,
adjusted their commercial allocations away from non-medical practices. And on consumer which is about 20% of
their business, they have adjusted their risk tolerance to the higher credit score borrowers.
National and regional unemployment forecasts give BHG more confidence that their borrowers should be able to
withstand forecasted inflationary increases in a way that allows BHG to better weather this environment than
others in their space. In comparison to other consumers, we believe BHG's borrowers are well paid with average
borrower earnings being approximately $287,000 annually. We are comfortable in their credit models, and their
credit experience bears this out.
Lastly, BHG had another great operating quarter in the third quarter. As I mentioned during the two previous
earnings call this year, we believe earnings in the first half of 2022 would likely be stronger than the second half,
as they sent more loans to the bank auction platform in the first half of the year rather than hold loans on their
balance sheet. As you know, the bank auction platform delivers immediate gain on sale income, while their
securitization network delivers interest income over the life of the loans.
Additionally, BHG did accomplish during September a $412 million securitization at an acceptable rate of 7%
when, as it appears to us, other fintech lenders were having to reevaluate their business models given the
operating environment. BHG was very pleased to be able to get this securitization done. Just a side note, Kroll
has now rerated BHG's first two issuances such that all tranches for all six prior securitizations are now
investment-grade, and the Senior Class A tranche and all issuances is AAA-rated.
We do want to highlight BHG's flexibility as to funding. Securitization platform spreads have compressed in 2022,
with the weighted average rate for the most recent issuance at 7%, compared to 5.5% in June and 2.5% in the
first quarter. This compression motivates BHG to reconsider selling more loans through its auction platform, as its
9


Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
spreads have held up better this year than anticipated. The key point is that they have the flexibility to do it. In the
end, overall profitability and balance sheet soundness are the key drivers for BHG.
As I mentioned earlier, BHG has updated their 2022 earnings guidance and now estimates about 25% earnings
growth over 2021. Again, looking forward, some key points I'd like to reemphasize. Credit remains consistent with
previous quarters, but BHG is and will be increasing reserves based on macroeconomic data at least over the
next few quarters. BHG has been modifying their credit models towards originating less risky assets.
Spread shrinkage may occur with more historic levels as we head into the fourth quarter and 2023. Production
volumes are very strong, and we believe they will continue to have strong production going into the fourth quarter
and 2023. Of note is that BHG anticipates at least two to four new funding alternatives to open up in the near
term, as they seek to broaden their already strong liquidity platform which we also believe is one of their strongest
attributes.
Quickly, here's an outlook for the remainder of 2022. For loans, we've increased our outlook to low 20% growth
for 2022. We have adjusted our rate forecast and now consider a 4.5% Fed funds rate by year end. We, like you,
will continue to monitor and modify as necessary, but we don't believe any reasonable changes to our current
planning assumption will impact our current outlook for 2022 materially.
Given that, we believe we should see continued improvement in net interest income this year, which should result
in net interest income growth in the low-20 percentage range. We still believe increases in hires and other factors
should result in expense growth being in the high-teens. All of this is about 2022. We'll provide more information
as to our 2023 outlook next quarter.
Last year at this time, our concerns were trying to figure out how to put together a 2022 plan just to grow
earnings. We were looking at low single-digit earnings growth rate for 2022, and it got no better by the end of the
year. Based on sell-side research at the time, 80% of our peer group was anticipating negative EPS growth in
2022. So, we're pleased with our 2022 financial performance thus far as we believe we will [ph] surely (00:32:37)
beat our loan-deposit revenue, PPNR, and earnings targets for this year.
Trust us. As I'm primarily speaking to my Pinnacle team, they were listening in, we have started building plans for
next year, and our goal remains the same: top quartile earnings performance no matter what gets thrown at us.
Paul, with that, I'll stop and see if there are any questions.

I wanted to start â€“ so, Harold, first, on the noninterest-bearing deposits, right, these went from 24% of total before
the pandemic, which is before QE, to 33% today. Do you think you can hold that mix at about that level? Or do
you see it migrating back, right â€“ we're in QT now. Do you see it migrating back as you continue to fund strong
loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, no, we don't think it's going to go back to pre-COVID levels. We've had a lot of initiatives around operating
accounts, and we've gathered a lot of clients. So, we don't think we'll get back down there. We did see the mix
shift that we noted in previously. But so far in October, and now granted we're only 18 days in, we're feeling pretty
good about where this deposit book is hanging in there on â€“ particularly on noninterest-bearing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

is?

Yeah. I think so. We may drift down a couple of notches, but I don't think it's going to be that dramatic.

Got you. Okay. And then as we think about expenses â€“ I appreciate next quarter, you will give us 2023. But when
we think about the ramp in hiring through 2022, could you just give us some framework about 2023? I mean,
should we at least be at a similar level of expense growth next year, just given the hiring that took place through
2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I'll give you some data points, and then I'll let Terry talk about momentum. I think we should see at least high
teens, mid to high teens kind of expense growth next year. That's what we're kind of looking at currently. Terry?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Steve, I think on higher momentum, as you saw, third quarter was a record quarter for us. I don't look for it
to stay at 53 revenue producers a quarter, but I expect it to remain high going forward. And so I think your idea is
correct that the hiring more or less occurs on a straight line, and I would expect it to continue for the foreseeable
future. And so how that bears on the expense growth is just exactly what you said. I mean, it'll be elevated
because we have hired throughout the year. And frankly, we intend to continue hiring at a similar rate in 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That is helpful. And then finally, there are many investors on the sidelines who are nervous to own your
stock here, not because of Pinnacle's credit quality, but their concern on the credit outlook for most of the fintech
lenders out there, including BHG, particularly given BHG expanded these newer verticals. Can you just share with
people on the sidelines how worried are you on the credit outlook at BHG given the macro environment? Just
additional color you could provide would be really helpful. Thanks.

Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Sure. We've had a lot of conversations with the leadership at Bankers Healthcare Group over the last several
quarters about their confidence with their book, their confidence in their credit models. They think or they believe
currently that their models are sound. If there is a significant kind of uptick in inflationary pressure, no doubt their
charge-offs could tweak up. But they are very confident with respect to their ability to find the best borrowers in
this environment and continue to monitor their book for, call it, cracks or weaknesses.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think, Steve, I might add just a couple other things. Obviously, for us as an investor, I always have been since
we started and continue to try to understand really what all that credit risk is. I think some things that give me
great comfort are, number one, they've got a huge group of people in analytics. They work on all kinds of
variables. You've heard us talk about that in the past. But the main variable, the foremost variable, obviously is
their credit score mechanism. We provide information to you on the FICO scores because that's a common thing
that you and I and others can all understand. It's a way to level-set. But they don't underwrite their credit off that
FICO score. They're using their own proprietary model, which they can demonstrate is 17% more predictive than
the FICO score.
And so, again, these are not credit novices. They've been through a number of cycles. They went through the
Great Recession without sustaining any losses, which not many of the banks they sell credit to could say that.
And so again, I think they started as a credit score card analytical group, has broadened out, but it still is their
strength. And so I love the capability that they have, the fact that their model is a little more rich than a FICO
score, which is sort of the industry standard. I think that's one thing that gives me a lot of confidence.
As I mentioned, I think the second thing I would say is, again, these guys have been through recessions in the
past, and their performance was extraordinarily good. It was better than our bank's performance and better than
most banks' performance. And so that's another item that gives me a great deal of confidence.
I think the third thing is, when â€“ so much of it is consumer credit. Some might â€“ even the business credit has a
consumer underwriting orientation to it. And so I guess the idea for me here is that the average borrower has
income of $287,000. When I think about various other fintechs, and I won't go through and name them all and
what their credit products are and so forth. I don't know any of them that are underwriting borrowers with
$287,000 in annual income. It's a different class borrower. These are not people that are borrowing money for a
washing machine or a small home improvement or something. I mean, these are substantial people. And so,
again, I think the mix of their borrower is different than what most of their fintech providers â€“ other fintech
providers are doing for their borrowers.
So, anyway, I just ramble through those three things.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess I wanted to dig down into the beta expectations you have that you
laid out in the presentation, both on the loan and then especially on the deposit side. 2021 growth and kind of
historical growth... [Technical Difficulty] (00:40:58-00:41:06)

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. I guess I'm just trying to think about where loan growth â€“ what kind of loan growth expectations you have in
2023 relative to those depose beta expectations, because it would seem with your expense guidance, if it's going
to be high-teens again, we might be looking for high-teens growth again. [Technical Difficulty] (00:41:31-00:41:36)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Sorry, but I think I got the â€“ Steve, I think I got the gist of the question. You kind of blanked out on me. I'm
not sure if the others on the call experienced the same thing or not.
I think going into next year, and the â€“ just looking at the net interest margin, if it â€“ historically, if it responds the
way it has done in the past, we're anticipating that as the Fed stops raising rates that the left side of the balance
sheet, yields and rates will likely start topping off, and that the deposit lag will likely be in effect through that time. I
was looking at our net interest margin performance over the last two years. It stayed fairly consistent at around a
2.95% to 3.05% range for the last two years during a fairly flat rate environment. So, we'd anticipate that kind of
performance with respect to our â€“ at least our margins once the Fed settles down on their rate increases.
Is that helpful?

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. You gave us a lot of colors as usual on BHG. Very much appreciated. On the one hand, you
continue to grow. You feel comfortable with that growth. But on the other hand, the recourse reserves or the new
terminology for it is expected to grow kind of as well. I hate that. I know it's really hard to kind of forecast, but you
had really good growth through the year in BHG better than excepted. Can you give us a stab at kind of the puts
and takes of how we should think about 2023 and the growth of that business just going into a slowdown?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Steve, we've had â€“ I mean, Michael. We've had some preliminary conversations with BHG about their next
year's outlook. They have â€“ they do believe their production platform will continue to deliver at a reasonable pace
next year, and they think they have opportunities to continue to kind of pivot between the securitization platform
and the gain on sale and the bank auction platform. I don't think it would be unreasonable to assume that next
year's growth rate might be somewhere around a 15% number, something like that. I'm hesitant to get into too
much detail because we need to have some more conversations with Bankers Healthcare Group.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
I certainly understood, and thanks for that. Maybe just more broadly speaking, you guys have been obviously very
active on the hiring front, and you've talked about dislocations maybe getting even more advantageous for you
into next year, just given the market dislocations. But it's been a while, I think, since you've kind of entertained the
thoughts of maybe doing a whole bank transaction. And just wanted to see, given the dislocations, that some
banks are going to have and some of the credit issues that I think we're going to see. Is that an avenue that you
could potentially open up again as we think about the next couple of years? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Michael, I think on that front, you've heard my answer before, and it's really no different in our position. I don't
think it's changed. I'm never going to say never, that we just absolutely won't do it. I don't want to say that. But I
don't think it's fair to say. You can see the hiring momentum that we have. I expect it to continue as long as we
can sort of continue that market share play for the foreseeable future, which I think we can.
You'd have to have a really compelling transaction to want to do it. And so if we find one of those, certainly we
would consider it. But, again, I just think the bias is more toward organic growth and continuing our market share
play. We're really in, I think, a luxurious position to have built a preferred bank standing for large bank employees
who want to exit their large bank. And so, again, I expect that will be our principal lever.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Right. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking the question. I guess going back to BHG, could you give an update,
Harold, on maybe some of the steps that they're taking to utilize more CECL-friendly disposition avenues and
what a day one potential estimate for BHG could look like right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. There's currently several different options or maybe a couple that I'll talk about. One is, within the
guidance, you can sell more the cash flows and then avoid CECL. So, call it similar to what they do with the gain
on sale platform with the banks, they can do that with institutional investors. They can also sell part of the residual
cash flows, maybe carve out some of those future cash flows and sell those, and then take those credits out of
the CECL kind of domain. So, there's a variety of different tactics they can deploy to try to avoid CECL.
Right now, they're thinking their reserves which are currently at 3.5%, could get into the 9% to 10% range with
day one CECL impacts. So, I don't know if that gets you all the way there, Jared, but that's what we've been
talking about thus far.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, any update on how you're thinking about your ownership stake in that? In the past, you said that

16


Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
maybe you could forge your own path. How should we be thinking about BHG as a percentage of the Pinnacle
balance sheet or earnings stream going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Terry, I'll start, and then let you finish. I don't think we've got any real strong change with our â€“ perspective on our
ownership of BHG. We're definitely not interested in owning or buying a majority stake in the franchise. I think
both Pinnacle and the two founders of the franchise were all on the same page. I think, if there were a liquidity
event, an opportunity for one, I think the founders and ourselves, we'd entertain it and see where it goes from
there. The market right now is not real, supportive of any kind of transaction. But I believe that, like I said, we're all
on the same page if there were something to come down the pipe.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Jared, I think I might add to Harold's comments. I mean, what he said is accurate. I think the case is that, as you
know, the valuation, whatever it is, it bounces around and has moved rapidly. If you look at, what I would say, the
value of that company is or what it has been 12 months ago, 9 months ago, 6 months ago, 3 months ago, it's
pretty dramatically different over that time period. And so, all of those things influence what can, in fact, be done.
When you talk about a liquidity event, obviously what you got to get down to is a willing buyer and a willing seller.
And so, again there are people that are always circling and looking for valuations and so forth. I think, as Harold
said, we and the other two owners are, at this point, at a really similar spot. We'd be willing to write valuations,
reduce our stakes, or sell the company. And so, again, it's just about how the market moves and where you find
that willing buyer and willing seller.
I think I've indicated, if nobody had to be happy but me, I think some reduction in our stake in BHG, to the extent
people want a minority interest in the company, is a good idea. I love the income that it generates. It's provided
extraordinary flexibility. It's been a tremendous strategic advantage in terms of funding, extraordinary growth here,
and allowing us to maintain very high profitability. And so, I don't want to completely give that away, to be candid.
But if it became a lesser percent of our income, that would probably, I think, add to investor perception, PE
multiples, all those kinds of things.
So, at any rate, it's impossible to say exactly what is going to happen, but we'd be willing to consider a reduction
or a sale of the company. And so, if that comes about, that'll be fine, but we're very comfortable to continue in the
current situation as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. All right. Thanks. And I guess, just shifting over to loan growth and the outlook as we go into next year. It
certainly sounds like you have good momentum with all hiring. If we're looking at a weaker maybe economic
backdrop, and I look at slide 7 and the different avenues of where that growth has come from, do you think that
you could see a shift with a bigger dependence on the expansion markets or having a bigger relative impact from
the hiring? Or do you think that we'll see sort of a broad-based, equally diversified pipeline of growth going into
2023?

My own sense of it is that it ought to remain relatively similar. I think as the new markets take hold, their growth
will be faster than in the legacy markets. But I think generally that allocation of the growth is probably a pretty
similar thing when you look at 12 months from now.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Wanted to go back up to the margin and the cumulative betas through 2022 I thought was really helpful with the
60% loan beta and then 40% cumulative deposit beta. How do you think, as we move into next year? I know
you're not giving next year guidance yet. But just kind of generally and directionally between the two, how do you
think those two trend next year? And is that â€“ 60% cumulative loan beta, is that a good number for next year? Are
there dynamics with kind of pricing of new loans and all of that that may kind of change that as we look at it full
cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Well, first of all, I want to make sure that we emphasize more about where the margin is versus where the
betas go. We provide the beta information that kind of help people get through it, but we're more interested in
what we think the margins going to do, given where the rate cycle is.
And like I was mentioning earlier, we think the margin â€“ once the Fed begins to kind of stop or ease or just stall,
that the margin will probably flatten out. And with deposit competition, we probably see some more increases in
our deposit rates. But as far as a beta question itself, in all likelihood, the loan beta would probably â€“ once it stalls,
would probably come down as with competitive pressure, but we think the lag on deposits would probably be
more influential on the longer-term margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And on that, how are you thinking â€“ I mean, the margin [indiscernible] (00:56:13) substantial expansion this
quarter. I expect we'll see it again next quarter. Any kind of â€“ any near-term thoughts on where you think the
margin may shake out next quarter? And then...

Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. We're not currently planning for another 30-basis-point uptick, but it ought to be somewhere half,
maybe a little more than half going into the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Half of the increase we saw this quarter?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q

Got it. Okay. And so you probably peak early 2023, and then start to flatten out to come down as you move
through the rest of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Our planning assumption is next year that we ought to see two 25-basis-point rate decreases in the last
half of the year. And so the margin pretty much flattens out in the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then on the composition of deposit growth of just the balanced growth was great to see. Just big
picture, how are you strategically thinking about the composition of where that growth will come? I know you
mentioned you still expect to grow noninterest-bearing. But then, how much do you think comes from noncore
versus core? And then also, you talked about some different specialty deposit strategies that you've got. You
could kind of talk about how you think that factors into the deposit growth outlook as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Terry, I'll start and let you go from there. Traditionally, our client base will provide 80% to 90% of the core funding
that we need to fund our loan growth. And so we've always had to go to the wholesale markets, tell a broker or
federal home loan bank to try to fund the gap with respect â€“ to try to fund the gap.
So, here, over the last couple of years, we've not had that problem. We've not had to go to the wholesale markets
much at all to get our liquidity to fund loan growth. So, we do have capacity internally to go to the wholesale
markets to fund loan growth, but there will be a stop gap. Before, we had kind of a 20% wholesale funding kind of
limitation. I don't see us getting anywhere near that. But we will do it to fund some loan growth.
But our â€“ like I said earlier, our belief is that our franchise â€“ a lot of value of our franchise is built in our deposit
book. And so we've got to make sure that we're looking under rocks for deposits, and I think our relationship
managers are doing just that today. I think where this new deposit growth is going to come from is from our new
hires and our new markets.

M. Terry Turner A

Yeah. I think I would add to that, Harold commented I think when he went over the slide, we have, over the last
year or two, been building some specialty deposit funding around HSAs, around community associations, which is
inclusive of homeowners' associations and property managers, some nonprofit specialties, and so forth. And
those have been built there all through breakeven. They are having success and we believe will be a meaningful
part of the funding as we get out through here as well. So, in addition to new people and new markets, I think the
new product specialties are important to us in terms of low cost funding.

Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just maybe circling back here, I have just one
clarification on the comments or just questions on expense growth earlier. I know you're not giving the guidance,
but just â€“ when you're talking about kind of that â€“ the high-teen expense growth, was that more â€“ from the people
you've already hired, was that really talking about the salary line or you're talking about total expenses there, just
for clarity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Mid to high teens would be for total expenses. Again, we're going through all of our planning for 2023
currently. We're pretty much maybe at the first few steps of a mini step journey. But that's probably where it's
going to shake out at the end of the day.
But that said, as Terry alluded to earlier in the call, our hiring plan, when you put it in effect or you start executing
it, what we're going to do is we're going to hire the people whenever we get an opportunity. We're going to be
opportunistic hirers. And so we may put in the plan that we're going to maybe hire 125 revenue producers next
year or 130 or whatever the number might be. But if we have a chance to double that, we might just go after it.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Got you. Okay. No. It makes sense. How about just shifting gears to the BHG? I think your â€“ I guess third quarter
is obviously down but strong, Harold. I guess fourth quarter, as it shapes up right now, should â€“ is the expectation
that it should drift a bit lower at BHG today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I don't know if I caught all your â€“ Brian, say that â€“ go back through that one more time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. Just the outlook for BHG in 4Q, I mean, relative to third quarter. Third quarter was strong but down, but
fourth quarter is also expected to be a bit lower given kind of your comments about the performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah, I think so. What could change our current perspective is if they send more loans to the auction
platform, which is what they did this quarter. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
...right now, they believe they're going to warehouse more loans on their balance sheet, which could tamp down
earnings in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And then just the â€“ maybe just looking at one line item on fee income, and that was just the â€“ I
guess the gain or loss on sale of other equity investments kind of the, I guess, significant drop this quarter as you
guys have talked about, kind of that volatility there. But just as we think about that number going forward, I guess
just kind of thinking average of the past quarters or just â€“ what's the best way to think about that, given this
quarter's mark relative to last quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We're not anticipating much movement in that year-to-date number here today. We'll get more information
through the quarter on all of those investments and see where it shakes out. But right now, we're not planning on
any kind of up or down movement with respect to anything in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And the new loan yields, Harold, where are they coming on today, I guess whether it be the month
of September, or just kind of whatever most recent data you have? Where are they â€“ where are you putting on
new loans today?

Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I could flip down to the back of the â€“ into the supplemental information and look at that number. But at the
end of September, we were at 5%. So, that would imply that we're â€“ yeah, we're getting there.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Yeah. I'll try to just throw our thoughts. If I'm not addressing what you're interested in, just redirect me and I'll hit it.
And I would say that the Atlanta market is almost exactly on target for what we would have hoped. We're probably
a little ahead on hiring. I think volumes are generally right where we would expect them to be, and so we're
excited about what's going on here in Atlanta.
I think in the case of Alabama, both Huntsville and Birmingham, I would say they have outperformed what our
expectations were, both in terms of hiring and in terms of the balance sheet volumes that they [indiscernible]
(01:05:46) early. On both sides of the balance sheet, loan and deposit volumes have been really attractive. And
so I think we're going to do better in those markets than what we had said.
And then in the case of DC, I would say, just for me personally, that's probably the market I am most excited
about. As you can see by the months in existence, we're still in the early stages, but their pipelines are building
pretty dramatically. You can see they've had great success hiring people and the â€“ again, both sides of the
balance sheet for them, what's in the pipeline, and what we expect to happen over the next two quarters, they'll
do better than what our original pro forma was as well.
So, anyway, that's how I look at those big markets. If I not addressed what you're interested in, please redirect
me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
No. That's great color. Thank you so much. And just a question, a lot of analysts and investors have asked about
normalizing credit, and I just wonder what you think normal is. Is normal somewhere between where we have
been at these historically low losses and problem asset levels and the historical median or is it â€“ or is it the
historical median? I mean, what do you think normal is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I think when you start using the term like normal, that obviously has to apply over a period of time. To me,
sort of through the cycle, you get ups and downs. And so I don't think there's any basis under which I would
expect to operate our economy at the levels of classified assets and nonperforming assets and so forth that we
are currently at through an entire cycle. So, at any rate, I think those median numbers are â€“ they're a reasonable
way to think about what ought to happen through a whole cycle.
Again, I personally think we're a ways away from that. But again, I think we're not â€“ for me to say, we expect
things to normalize, I just want people to understand, I don't think we're going to be operating at the level of
classified assets and nonperforming assets that we've been at over the last handful of quarters for the
foreseeable future. Surely, you'll have to go up to some extent. Again, maybe the median numbers are good
planning assumption.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. I just had a follow-up on expenses. Feel like your stack has started to underperform since the call started
when you mentioned a high teens expense growth rate. So, I just wanted to circle back to that comment and
maybe provide you the opportunity to remind us how nimble you can be on the expense side if the revenue
growth is not going to come in as expected. If we see loan growth slow or the margin come in lower than
expected, how nimble can you be on pulling back that high-teen expense guidance you gave? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Harold, you want to go first?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I'll go first. Thanks, Catherine, for the follow-up. Yeah. I mean, we've always got the ability to take money
out of the expense book. But the big thing that we can â€“ that we always do around here is our incentive plans are
all tied to earnings growth. And so if our earnings growth doesn't come around, then we've got opportunities to
take quite a large sum of money out of our incentive plan to kind of fortify our P&L and make sure our earnings
growth is reasonable under the circumstances.
The other thing, and we did this back during the financial crisis, is we can always pull back on hiring that will
impact our longer term growth, so we're not really anxious to do that. But there's a lot of variability in our expense
book that we can go after when it's absolutely necessary.
Terry, I'll stop there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Catherine, I guess I had to hit two things. I mean, Harold said it, but just in case there are people who don't
get it, the incentive â€“ we have sacrificed 100% of our incentives if we don't produce our earnings targets, and our
earnings targets were set to be top quartile performance. And so that's the biggest expense lever that you have.
We don't get paid unless shareholders do get paid. And I don't think there is a company that I'm familiar with that
will do that and protect shareholders to that extent.
I think the second thing is, and I'll pound away on this for a reason, but I don't feel successful in getting people to
understand that the hiring that we do, because we do it on a straight line, it's a huge part of the expense basin.
So, we're paying expenses today for revenues that are yet to come. And so my only message in that is, there's an
immense amount of profitability that comes when we quit hiring people. All the revenue continues to roll in and the
expenses cease to grow. And so there's huge profit leverage in just that single idea right there. When you think
about having hired 53 revenue producers this quarter, that revenue will come in. And so then if we have
difficulties, we quit hiring people, and so the expenses stop growing but the revenue continues to grow.
So, anyway, that's my own view of it. That's the way we've operated over an extended period of time. And I'm not
sure everybody understands how that works, but you can quit hiring, and it does produce earnings growth even
though it impacts the longer term balance sheet and earnings growth. In the short run, it accelerates earnings
growth.

Got it. That's helpful. Thanks for the follow-up. And I mean, I just â€“ if you're going to put a high teens expense
growth right out there, then it's just fair to assume that the revenue growth rate is going to be above that, just
given your business model, correct?
