MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Jeff Edwards
Head-Investor Relations, The Charles Schwab Corp.
And here we go. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for the Schwab 2023 Summer Business
Update. We certainly weren't going to let a little searing Texas heatwave get in the way of providing you with a
strategic update on our business. This is Jeff Edwards, Head of Investor Relations, and I'll be followed very
shortly by our esteemed presenters, Co-Chairman and CEO, Walt Bettinger; President, Rick Wurster; and CFO,
Peter Crawford.
Before we kick off, let's briefly hit on a few housekeeping items. Similar to past events, I'll be helping facilitate
Q&A, and we are still abiding by the one question, no follow-up format. We also ask that you save any clarifying
or reconciling questions regarding this morning's reported quarter for the IR team. Today's slides will be posted to
the IR website at the beginning of Peter's remarks.
Okay. Before we get on to the interesting stuff, let's start by everyone's favorite slide, our forward-looking
statements page, which reminds us all that the future is inherently uncertain. So please stay up-to-date with our
disclosures.
And with that, Walt, please take it away.

Walter William Bettinger
Co-Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm looking forward to another triple-digit day here in Texas. It's a
beautiful day, but it definitely will be a scorcher. A number of years ago, I used an illustration that seemed timely
to resurrect. When my office used to be in downtown San Francisco, I would often look out toward Treasure
Island early in the morning, only to see dense fog. And the fog would not only mask the beauty of Treasure Island,
it would often be so dense that you couldn't even see the island out in the bay. In fact, if you didn't know it was
there, you might not even realize Treasure Island even existed. In some ways, it seems to me that the fog has
settled in again, just as it did a few years ago, and that fog is clouding how some see Charles Schwab today.
Years ago, the fog represented the extended period of ZIR or zero interest rates. Today, the fog represents the
short-term challenges brought on by the near-record pace of interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve. But as
we all know, the fog clouding Treasure Island ultimately lifts, and the beauty of Treasure Island becomes clear
and, of course, Treasure Island represents Charles Schwab. Some look at the fog and only see fog. Some look at
the fog and know what is temporarily hidden by it and recognize how that fog is currently masking the
extraordinary progress we are making as a firm.
Those who know what is hidden by the fog recognize our ongoing organic growth and market share gains,
successful execution and integration of the largest brokerage combination in history, ideal positioning with
leadership positions in the two fastest-growing areas of investment services, that's serving Registered Investment
Advisors and serving independent-minded [audio gap] (00:03:07) the low-cost provider today and poised to widen
this advantage over the next 18 to 24 months, an exceptional profitability, even in the most challenging of times.
Today's presentations and discussions are intended to help more people understand the fog, as well as what is
hidden by the fog. So, thanks a lot for following along.

Although still somewhat uneven, the second quarter began to show some signs of an improving economic and
investing environment. Inflation began to moderate and, well, the Fed paused its record pace of interest rate
increases, at least for the month of June. As equity market volatility fell, overall equity markets performed
reasonably well, but it was an exceptionally narrow market, with just a handful or two of large-cap growth
companies accounting for a significant percentage of the solid performance.
Investors took note, and as you can see, investor sentiment turned positive by the end of the quarter. Our investor
clients remained relatively active in the markets, making over 5 million trades per day and with purchases
exceeding sales by about 20%. Year-to-date, our clients have entrusted us with over $180 billion in net new
assets, a strong number, given the tax month of April falls in the first half of the year, and a level of net new
assets consistent with our long-term historical trend of net new assets between 5% and 7% of our total asset
base. In addition, clients have opened approximately 2 million new accounts year-to-date.
Key client metrics continue to be solid. In retail, our speed to answer phone calls averaged under 20 seconds,
and this is a particularly important metric, as we transitioned millions of former Ameritrade clients over to Schwab
during the first half of the year. Advisory flows in retail were also solid at over $13 billion. In Advisor Services, we
continued to be the destination of choice for breakaway brokers and broker teams of all sizes. Year-to-date, we've
assisted almost 160 teams moving over to independents with Schwab as their primary custodian and the average
advisor manages about $90 million, who converted to independents.
Of course, these near-term metrics are important, but the long-term success of Schwab is even more important
and revealing. We have a distinctive set of competitive advantages built over multiple decades that enable us to
serve clients in a better way while, at the same time, rewarding our stockholders. Our advantages revolve around
our size and scale, our operating efficiency, service culture, operating structure, reputation, and willingness to be
disruptive.
These six advantages help us to execute on our Through Clients' Eyes strategy, which has resulted in a dramatic
increase in market share over the past decade, as we've meaningfully grown our market share of client assets by
multiples of our key competitors at independent broker-dealers, as well as wirehouses. This change in market
share is more than simply numbers on a page. It represents millions of clients and hundreds of billions of dollars
of client assets proactively choosing Schwab. And in doing so, getting a better deal than what they traditionally
experienced.
And while our scale and efficiency has positioned us as the low cost provider for many years, we are ready to
widen that gap meaningfully in the next 18 months, as we reap the efficiency and automation benefits of the
Ameritrade integration. We anticipate the realization of expense savings to be substantial. In addition to the
remaining $500 million of synergy savings that we originally committed to as part of the Ameritrade acquisition,
we now anticipate achieving at least an additional $500 million in future expense savings.
These savings will come from a variety of areas; real estate savings, lower head count from efficiencies gained
via automation, built and implemented as part of the integration work, streamlining our organization to ensure we
are set up to operate most efficiently post-integration, and the removal of temporary expenses that were
associated with the integration that we added to ensure a smooth and thoughtful process for our clients.
And, Rick, before I turn it over to you to discuss in more depth where we stand with our integration process and
the ongoing success we're seeing with existing clients and new prospects, I wanted to simply reinforce the
strength of our firm. The successful track record we have built up over decades continues. The competitive

advantages we have built continue. And I'm quite confident that the fog temporarily shrouding our firm will lift and
sunny days will return in the coming quarters.
Rick?

Richard A. Wurster
President, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Thank you, Walt, and hello, everyone. Our efforts remain squarely focused on our three strategic areas: scale and
efficiency, win-win monetization and client segmentation. In our time today, I'll highlight the progress we've made
in each focus area and talk through the opportunities that we see ahead.
Starting with scale and efficiency, integration has been and remains our number one priority. Over Memorial Day
weekend, we completed the largest brokerage conversion in the industry, moving more than 5 million client
accounts from Ameritrade to Schwab. Thanks to the dedication of an incredible team, the conversion was a
success. No material issues occurred, despite the fact we migrated 11 times more clients than our previous
February conversion weekend. Client engagement has been strong with 1.3 million clients logging into Schwab
within the first week following the conversion weekend.
In fact, Schwab's second largest market open occurred with no issues on a Tuesday immediately following
Memorial Day. And by the end of the day on that Tuesday, our service levels had returned to normal, with us
answering calls at an average of 7 seconds just a day after the conversion. More broadly, client and asset attrition
within our conversion groups have been below expectations.
While we are still in the middle of what has been a successful client conversion, we remain laser focused on
seeing it through to completion in the months ahead. We are on track to migrate the remaining Ameritrade clients
in three additional transition groups in September, November, and in the first half of 2024.
One of the exciting parts of our conversion is the combined capabilities for our clients, whether they are a retail
client or an advisor client. And I'd like to start by sharing the benefits on the retail side. We've invested in our web
and mobile experiences at Schwab to ensure we have the best of the features and functionalities of both firms.
Our former Ameritrade clients will have access to the full spectrum of portfolio and wealth management solutions
that we have had at Schwab.
Ameritrade clients will also be able to access our banking capabilities, our branch network experience, and our
exceptional client service. The branch network experience includes providing access to planning and wealth
management capabilities that were not a focus of Ameritrade. We believe that will help Ameritrade clients
consolidate at Schwab, rather than rely upon a second firm.
Now let me discuss the benefits to Schwab's retail clients. One of the biggest enhancements for existing Schwab
clients will come when we make thinkorswim available to them later this year. thinkorswim is one of the crown
jewels of Ameritrade, and it's widely considered to be the premier trading platform in the market today, with its
unique combination of powerful tools and dedicated service from experienced trading professionals, alongside
education for all levels of experience. And all retail clients will have this at our competitive pricing, representing
our true no trade-offs approach.
The same is true for our RIA clients. Ameritrade advisors will migrate to Schwab over the September conversion
weekend, but they already have access to meaningful aspects of our RIA experience. Ameritrade advisors
already participate in our flagship industry events, including IMPACT. They've started to benefit from our leading
5

Business Update Call 18-Jul-2023
business consulting offer, including participating in our annual benchmarking study and the Executive Leadership
Program. And we've included them in our RIA industry advocacy programs, while also giving them access to
resources like our Strategy Desk, which educates advisors on how to use various options strategies through one-
on-one consultations, as well as our Block Desk, which helps advisors to optimize their best execution process.
And as we look to Labor Day weekend, preparations for conversion are well underway and advisors are engaged.
80% of firms who only custody with Ameritrade have already begun to credentialize themselves. Over 20,000 Veo
One users have accessed Schwab Advisor Center to test drive our platform. Over 5,000 firms to date have
attended at least one educational webinar session.
And we are spending the summer helping firms get familiar with our technology, our investment offerings, and our
people, so they are ready to do business at Schwab after Labor Day weekend. And after conversion, all advisors
will enjoy the full benefits of our combined offer, a custodial platform that is designed to help RIAs of all sizes
grow and succeed.
Schwab advisors will benefit from award-winning platforms and capabilities like thinkpipes, iRebal, and for Model
Market Center technology. And Schwab Advisor Center will incorporate Veo One's most popular features and
functionality. Ameritrade advisors will have access to the breadth of Schwab's offer, including Schwab Charitable
and Schwab Bank. We believe there will never have been a stronger custodial offer in the market than coming out
of the conversion weekend.
Turning now to win-win monetization, clients are continuing to come to Schwab for advice, and we've seen strong
flows in our full-service wealth programs and our managed investing solutions. Schwab Wealth Advisory had $5.9
billion in net flows for the first half of 2023, an increase of 89% compared to last year. And notably, some of these
inflows are being driven by a meaningful increase in flows from existing advisory clients, which, combined with a
strong Client Promoter Score, demonstrates the value clients see in the offer.
It is also worth noting that 20% of flows into Schwab Wealth Advisory in the first half of the year were from
Ameritrade FCs, validating our belief that there is a large untapped demand among Ameritrade clients for more
help and advice, a significant asset and retention opportunity which we are excited to capture in the years ahead.
Client interest in the Wasmer Schroeder Strategies continues to be strong, with $2.8 billion in net flows for the first
half of the year. In just a few years, Wasmer Schroeder Strategies have gone from 0% to 31% of our managed
account solutions assets at Schwab. This clearly demonstrates our ability to drive win-win monetization, as clients
have benefited from lower-cost fixed income strategies than they had previously, and we are benefiting from
outsized flows in fixed income.
Ameritrade clients migrating to Schwab are showing appetite for our advice offers. When we look at net flows into
our Managed Investing solutions year-to-date, more than $280 million came from legacy Ameritrade clients after
they migrated to Schwab. Finally, we continue to build on our Schwab Personalized Indexing offer. In June, we
rolled out a new digital experience for our RIA clients and gave them more flexibility to tailor their clients' Schwab
Personalized Indexing portfolios. Advisors are also now able to digitally onboard their clients into our direct
indexing offer and have access to a new digital dashboard that highlights the performance of each account.
Turning now to client segmentation. Just last week, we launched two new branded client experiences to meet the
unique needs of our retail self-directed clients with more than $1 million and those with more than $10 million in
assets. The new experience for clients with $1 million to $10 million is called Schwab Private Client Services, and
6

the experience for our $10 million plus clients is Schwab Private Wealth Services. Our goal is to meet the needs
of these clients across several key dimensions, relationships, service, operations, product and price.
The differentiated experiences will include access to a dedicated Schwab consultant, who can help them manage
their financial life, access to dedicated service teams, access to a range of wealth management specialists,
discounted mortgage pricing, special client events, and more. Our high net worth clients already represent more
than two-thirds of our retail client assets. And as you can see on this page, they also represent the areas, where
we have the greatest growth potential, as these are our fastest-growing retail segments. Meeting the needs of key
client segments, as we are doing with these new experiences, will continue to support our long-term asset growth.
We've spent quite a bit of time in this forum talking about the opportunities for growth that we see ahead. I've
described in some detail how our strengths have positioned Schwab to sustain an organic growth rate of 5% to
7% over the long term by attracting new assets from existing clients and attracting new clients to Schwab. These
strengths include a client base that is in the peak of wealth accumulation, dedicated relationships, our
commitment to RIA growth, our brand, our acquisition model and our workplace pipeline.
As Walt shared earlier, our 2023 year-to-date organic growth rate remains in this consistent range, north of 5%,
and we are well-positioned for this to continue. As we've shared in prior quarters, we have an attractive $3.5
billion to $4 billion revenue opportunity ahead in wealth management, as we increase advice penetration among
retail clients and grow our lending offer for all clients.
I'll wrap up where Walt started. Our Through Clients' Eyes strategy remains our northstar. With clients at the
forefront of every decision we make, we are successfully delivering on a historic integration, while making
progress on our strategic focus areas. At the same time, we're adhering to the financial discipline that is the
hallmark of our all-weather business model by identifying opportunities for cost savings and efficiencies that will
allow us to reinvest in our clients and reward our stockholders. With this approach, we are on track to harness the
tremendous long-term growth opportunities that lie ahead.
And with that, I will turn it over to Peter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Thank you very much, Rick. So, Walt and Rick talked about how our Through Clients' Eyes strategy continues to
power strong client growth, enabling us to take significant share within the wealth management category, the
progress we're making with the Ameritrade acquisition and integration and our excitement about what the
combination means for our clients and our stockholders, our plans to further our industry leading cost advantage,
both through the remaining Ameritrade integration efforts and other expense reduction actions, and how we're
continuing to advance our broader strategic agenda.
In my time today, I'll talk about how our second quarter financial performance, which was down from the very high
bar we set in 2022 due largely to temporary factors, also provide an update on the slowing pace of cash
realignment activity, a trend which reinforces our confidence that we're already past peak usage of temporary
supplemental funding. And as the amount of that higher cost funding decreases, our core earnings power will be
unlocked. And finally, I'll share an updated outlook for 2023 and some early thoughts on certain aspects of 2024,
which we expect will reflect a continued return to "normal for the company".
Now, what I believe should become clear is that, while our near-term financial performance has been impacted by
client cash allocation activity, activity that we have supported and even encouraged, that activity is moderating, as
7

one would expect, which means that the potential trajectory of our longer-term financial performance should be
getting increasingly clear. And as it does so, you should see the benefit of our continued growth, our tireless drive
for greater efficiency, and the resilience of our diversified business model.
As Walt mentioned, despite the volatile environment and somewhat more muted investor sentiment, we have
continued to drive healthy organic growth throughout 2023. Now, if you look at our financial performance in
isolation, you'd say, it was a very strong quarter, nearly $5 billion of revenue and adjusted pre-tax margin of well
over 40% and over 36% on a GAAP basis, our 33rd straight quarter over 35% and $0.75 of adjusted EPS.
But relative to second quarter of last year, of course, revenue and earnings were lower, and this is almost entirely
the consequence of client cash allocation activity, which has led to lower interest-earning assets and greater
usage of higher cost supplemental funding, primarily CDs and FHLB, which we have utilized to support this
activity, utilization which is temporary in nature and, therefore, is not expected to weigh on our long-term financial
performance. And, in fact, assuming stable client engagement, we believe our net interest margin this past
quarter should represent a trough for the year.
Speaking of interest-earning assets or assets in general, bank deposits were down 7% sequentially due to client
cash allocation decisions, but we saw a significant decrease in the pace of that activity from April to May and then
May to June. Our liquidity position remains quite strong and our capital position continues to get even stronger
with our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio rising to 7.5%.
And what we're calling here are our adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is inclusive of AOCI and, therefore, what
our binding constraint would be if we lose the AOCI opt-out, that ratio at our three banking subsidiaries all topping
4% by the end of the quarter. Again, those aren't our regulatory capital ratios yet, but we expect they will be at
some point in the future, and you can see we're well on our way to meeting those new regulatory requirements
well ahead of the likely deadline.
We shared in our last SMART report the dramatic reduction in the pace of client cash allocation activity from April
to May. And in June, we saw a further slowing in the pace of deposit flows. And the reduction would have been
even more significant were it not for a large reversal in client equity allocations from sales in May to net purchases
in June. Now, that broader trend is encouraging, but not surprising, and it's reinforced by specific data points we
see when we look under the hood. We're seeing fewer and fewer individuals making their initial purchase of an
investment cash solution, a purchase money fund or CD or Treasury security.
And since the clients with larger cash balances moved first, again, not surprisingly, the average size of those
initial purchases has also come down. And this is really important, in June, we also saw a net deposit increase for
our Advisor Services business and that's significant, because in this and in previous cycles, Advisor Services has
tended to be a leading indicator of what will happen with Investor Services realigning first as rates start to rise and
now slowing substantially. And as I said, actually, increasing slightly their Schwab One and Bank's rebalances in
the month of June, and that's again, despite a net equity purchases.
As you all know, we have supported this client cash allocation activity first via a range of organic sources, cash on
hand, as well as cash that comes in via new accounts, and also with principal and interest payment from our
securities portfolio. But to the extent that those three sources have been insufficient, we have utilized a mix of
temporary sources, including CDs and short-term funding from the FHLB. And borrowing an unexpected increase
in deposit outflows from clients engaging more actively in the equity markets, the pace of that activity has now
dropped to a level that we can cover with those organic sources.

In fact, we have not initiated any new short-term borrowings or CDs since late May, which means that we have
already seen a decline in that supplemental funding, again, that encompasses CDs, FHLB and repo of $12 billion
since the peak in late May. And as client cash realignment continues to slow and eventually reverses, we'd expect
those supplemental funding balances to continue to decline over the next 18 months and be mostly paid off by the
end of 2024. And this means that they should not really be a factor in our earnings picture in 2025 and beyond.
Looking out to the rest of the year, as client cash allocation activity abates, we'd expect to see a return of
transactional cash growth later this year. And then as we continue to pay off the higher cost funding sources,
while driving strong organic growth, we should see a stabilization of revenue and then a resumption of growth
leading to a year-over-year revenue decline of roughly 7% to 8%, with our net interest margin expanding from
here to reach a level in the mid-210s basis points by Q4, assuming the dot plot from a couple of weeks ago. So
two more 25-basis point Fed increases.
On the expense side, we've already taken steps to trim our spending levels this year, such that we now expect
our 2023 adjusted expense growth to be somewhere in the 6-ish percent range inclusive of $160 roughly million
one-time FDIC surcharge, meaning that our other spending is tracking roughly 300 basis points below the range
we communicated back in January, as we have adjusted and optimized our expense base consistent with Walt's
earlier comments.
Now, turning our attention to 2024. We expect to see strong growth in revenue and profitability, driven by an
expansion of net interest margin into the upper 200s, as we see a return of core deposit growth and pay-off a vast
majority of the supplemental funding we've accessed. And the realization of at least $1 billion of net run rate
expense synergies, including more than $500 million in net 2024 reductions relative to the outlook we shared
back in January. And that would imply that 2024 adjusted expenses could be similar to or potentially even a little
below 2023 levels.
From a capital standpoint, our plan is to continue to conserve capital for the immediate future, and we see a clear
path toward growing our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio, inclusive of AOCI, back to our operating objective at
some point in 2024, at which point, we could be in position to resume more opportunistic capital return.
And then looking even longer term, we continue to see a significant opportunity for continued NIM expansion,
even after we realize the benefits of paying off the supplemental funding. And that comes from investing new
money and reinvesting principal and interest from our existing securities portfolio at rates that are much higher
than we earn today. It's important to note, this would still happen even if rates fall from their peak as the dot plots
currently suggest.
I've spoken at length this morning about some of the dynamics that are temporarily weighing on our financial
performance. And as those dynamics fade into the background, we remain very confident that our financial
formula will reassert itself to drive long-term earnings growth, as it has for multiple decades. It's built on our
Through Clients' Eyes strategy and no trade-offs approach, which positions us to drive sustainable and consistent
organic growth.
And even as we've worked our way through multiple rate cycles, made disruptive moves like cutting equity
commissions to zero and acquiring Ameritrade, we've been able to convert that strong organic growth into client
asset growth, revenue growth, and through ongoing expense discipline, expanding margins, and then through
efficient capital management, drive mid-teens plus EPS growth through the cycle. That has been the financial
formula for Schwab for much of our history. And as we emerge from this unique period, we're extremely confident
it will continue to reward our long-term stockholders for years, decades to come.

portion of the program?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Yes. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ken Worthington with
JPMorgan. You may go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth B. Worthington Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. My question is on the revenue synergies from Ameritrade and
your expectations now. In January, I believe you expected $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion of revenue synergies from
the transaction, with BDA balances as the leading driver. And if so, how have cash sorting in the revised BDA
agreement impacted both the size and the timing of your expected revenue synergies here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford A
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yeah, I'll take that one. Thank you, Ken. So, I would say, fundamentally, we remain very, very bullish on the
revenue synergies. And as you point out, certainly, a significant portion of those revenue synergies are coming
from moving the BDA balances from TD Bank over to Schwab Bank's balance sheet over time. And those
continue, despite the fact that the way that we have renegotiated the IDA agreement, that's more of a near-term
dynamic. The long-term implication of that, the long-term planning has not changed, which is that we'd expect to
move those balances over our balance sheet and realize those revenue synergies from doing so. But that's only a
part of the story.
And I think the other part of the revenue synergies are we're very, very excited about and those come from
allowing the legacy Ameritrade clients to have access to Schwab's broader array of wealth management
solutions, lending, advice, etcetera. And Rick talked in his comments about some of the early signs of progress of
interest in those solutions.
If you look at the penetration rate of advice among their legacy retail clients within Schwab, it's about 19%;
Ameritrade, it's about 6% or 7%. And we think that's a huge untapped need. We know those clients are interested
in that advice, and we're very, very excited about that opportunity, which we think will unfold over multiple years.

seasonality with cash build around December, are you assuming growth in deposits ex the normal seasonal
benefit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford A
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yeah. Dan, I don't know if I want to parse it quite that fine. I would say is we do expect that we'll see a resumption.
I mean, if you look at the trends from – frankly, even from the first quarter, from March to April, April to May, and
May to June, and you don't have to do too unusual, I guess, extrapolations to see that flipping. So we'd expect
that we'll see return of deposit growth, I would say, ahead of that typical seasonal buildup [indiscernible]
(00:35:25) November and into December.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just on that subject, if we do see the build-in
deposits as we move through the year and into 2024, Peter, can you talk about what type of LCR ratio would you
prefer to operate in? And I think, historically, in the last year or so in the 110% to 130% range, so well above
100%. But is that a range that you would generally like to stay in or, in the new environment, would you prefer to
build liquidity over and above that range? And then if it's in that range, could that imply faster FHLB paydown than
your model potentially?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford A
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yeah. So, I mean, I think, I guess, I'd say – answer this a couple of ways. I mean, when we think about LCR, what
we really focus on is the LCR and then, certainly, there's LCR at the banks, but there's also LCR at the parent.
And when we look at the LCR at the parent, that's really driven more by what's happening on the broker-dealer
side. That tends to be the – we have – and so, that is a function of what's happening in the margin balances, free
credit balances and so forth.
Within the banks, we certainly have ample access and ample liquidity, a very, very liquid portfolio there. We have
been running a little bit higher levels of cash. I'd expect that, as we continue to put some distance between now
and where we were back in March and sort of the – with some of the stresses around the banking system, we'll
continue to let those cash levels decline, and that will be a contributor to paying down and retiring some of the
CDs and the FHLB. So, I would say, that would probably be the bigger factor is continuing to let those cash
balances decline back closer to our operating objective, which is more around 5% or 6% of deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead.

Michael Anagnostakis Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, good morning. It's Michael Anagnostakis on for Steven. Just maybe another one on the balance sheet here.
Now that it feels like the dust has settled from the banking crisis, is selling down a portion of the securities
portfolio something you're considering to pay down high cost borrowing sooner? And from a regulatory
perspective, would your lower Tier 1 leverage inclusive of AOCI preclude you from crystallizing those losses?
Thank you.

Peter B. Crawford A
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yeah. Thanks very much for the question. I know there's been a lot of, I guess, speculation on this and a lot of
discussion about this. I'm glad you asked this. So, let me reiterate, first and foremost, we do not need to – and it's
something we said previously, we do not need to sell securities. We have plenty of liquidity to support the client
cash allocation activity. As we talked about, that activity is slowing and we remain quite profitable. Our capital
levels are growing and our NIM is poised to improve as we've talked about.
At the same time, we certainly recognize that selling securities can look good on paper from a financial
standpoint, as it would accelerate some of the trends that we'd otherwise see, things like increasing our go
forward net interest margin, net interest revenue, accelerating the paydown of borrowings, building our capital
levels. But the important point is that's an acceleration of trends that are already happening. And we're very
mindful of the potential risks that doing something like that could be misunderstood or misperceived by the
outside world, and most importantly, by our clients. And so, I would say, it remains something we won't rule out,
but it's not something we are actively pursuing at this time. Thanks for the question.

Michael J. Cyprys Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on some of the
steps you guys are taking to expand advice penetration within the retail customer set. I think that's maybe around
14% today, advise penetration of the retail customers. What actions can you guys do to accelerate and lift that
higher over time? What level do you think is achievable? If you look out like five years, is 20% reasonable? And
which offerings and services do you think will be the most meaningful in helping drive that uplift?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Wurster A
President, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yeah. So, I would say that we have lots of opportunity in driving advice penetration and the reason being that our
clients are increasingly looking to us for advice. They want help and guidance. In all measures where we survey
clients, they're asking for more help and guidance, and we'd like, certainly, for Schwab clients, to turn to us for
help and guidance. So, we want to provide what they need.
We've done a lot to try to bolster our offerings and I'll share a few things. The first thing we've done is we've taken
our proprietary Schwab Wealth Advisory offering, which is our full-service wealth management offer to clients, and
we've invested in it tremendously in the past couple of years. And we've seen the returns to that, as you can see
by the 90% increase in flows or 89% increase in net flows that we reported, as well as the really strong Client
Promoter Scores that we consistently earn in that offer. So the investments have been paying off and we've seen
an acceleration of growth there.
And as I mentioned earlier, a lot of it has come from Ameritrade clients, who didn't have access to a program like
this previously that are now turning towards it. So that is all encouraging. We also, as you are aware, bought
Wasmer Schroeder a few years ago. We're seeing just tremendous growth in the fixed income space for clients
that want help and guidance there. And then, we are encouraged by what we're seeing in Schwab Personalized
Indexing.

We believe 5, 10 years from now, taxable assets, that will be the primary location that the clients save or invest in
taking share from ETFs over time, and we're at the forefront of that, driving down the cost for clients to participate
in that, as well as the minimum asset size. We've democratized access to personalized investing, which is very
much in line with our heritage.
And then finally, what I would say is, our SAN program, our Schwab Advisor Network program continues to grow
and we gain really strong flows on our platform. We want to make sure clients have access to whatever help and
guidance they need, whether it's a Schwab proprietary offer or something through our advisor network, and we
continue to see robust flows there. The combination of all that is growing at Schwab and it's also growing among
Ameritrade clients. So, we think the future is really bright in wealth. We've invested a lot in it. And thankfully, we're
seeing the returns to those investments, both at Schwab and among our Ameritrade clients.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning, everybody. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on sort of how net new money
is allocating cash once it gets into Schwab. So, as you think about your organic growth kind of net 5-ish, 6-ish
percent range recently, what percentage of the cash that comes across actually goes into the Schwab Bank
versus into some of the higher-yielding options? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford A
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yeah, it's a tough – I mean, we get this question a lot and it's a really tough question to answer, because it really
is kind of what timeframe are you looking at when you answer that question. I mean, the money tends to come in
heavily in the form of cash, sort of 45% or 50% maybe in the form of cash. But over time, not surprisingly, it gets
invested and it gets invested in ways that look similar to our existing clients. So, quite often, we'll bring in cash,
invest in the equity markets, invest in mutual funds, fixed income, and typically leave some of that cash on the
balance sheet as transactional cash.
So it really depends. New accounts versus existing accounts tend to have different behavior. But I would say that,
in aggregate, over time, as we grow new accounts, those new accounts typically bring a level of transactional
cash that helps to offset or more than offset any residual client cash realignment activity that's happening among
our existing accounts. And so, that becomes an important source of deposit growth over time.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious, Peter, if you have considered what TLAC, if that was
applied to Schwab, might mean, and what that would mean as far as the long-term debt you might need to carry,
obviously, not versus where we are today because we've got this big buildup of the wholesale. But once we get to
sort of steady state versus the steady state before this all began, have you considered that, and what impact that
might have?

Peter B. Crawford A
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yes. We certainly have considered and looked at that, and I think there's still a number of dimensions of that that
are to be determined. And so, the implications are a little bit up in the air. But I would say, the bottom line is, none
of the implications we think are going to be, in any way, disruptive. I mean, they'll be very manageable.
Depending on how the TLAC is calibrated, whether it's calibrated at the G-SIB level or it's calibrated sort of the
lower level, based on the analysis we've seen, we could have either enough debt already, or have to issue a very
modest amount, I mean, sort of a couple of billion dollars, $2 billion, $3 billion of incremental debt. So, again,
when you think about the carrying cost of that, it's quite modest. So, we don't see that as being sort of a
significant factor moving forward.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Benjamin Budish with Barclays. You may go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Budish Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi, there. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to double check on the incremental cost synergies you talked
about. In the slide deck, you mentioned that the 2024 expense growth of kind of flat to negative is based on the
assumption that you realize those savings. Is that sort of the plan that the remaining $500 million plus the
additional $500 million will all be realized over the course of 2024? And then how do we think about the risk that
expense growth could be slightly positive, or just the kind of parameters around which we might think about
modeling next year's OpEx growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford A
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Sure. So, as we shared previously, the $500 million of remaining expense synergies related to the integration, the
majority of those will be unlocked as we complete the integration and then months after we complete integration.
And so, as we shared previously, we expect that the vast majority of that $500 million would be realized on a run
rate basis by the end of 2024. The $500 million of incremental expense savings that Walt previewed in his
comments, we'd expect [indiscernible] (00:47:32) of those to be realized by the end of 2023. And so, those would
have [indiscernible] (00:47:38) impact on 2024.
But those are incremental, too. Those were not contemplated in the scenario that we had shared at the Winter
Business Update, where I think we talked about something like 4% to 5% adjusted expense growth from 2023 to
2024. You take that and you just subtract that – at least that $500 million plus, as we talked about, that's how you
get to flat to negative adjusted expense growth from 2023 to 2024.
But again, given the fact that we're realizing some of the expense synergies related to integration in 2024, that will
clearly have a benefit as we go from 2024 to 2025 as well. So it's really looking at two years of sort of below trend
adjusted expense growth.

Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you can provide an update on the technological improvements
expected for the lending platform this summer. Assuming deposit growth picks up later this year, how do you see

the asset side of the balance sheet expanding? Do you see more of a mix shift towards lending versus rebuilding
the securities book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Wurster A
President, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yeah. We've got some exciting developments on the lending side. One of the things we're thrilled to do is launch
a digital Pledged Asset Line experience here during the month of July to our advisors. And we anticipate that will
be among the easiest and fastest Pledged Asset Line experience in the industry.
We'll do the same in retail. We'll follow with retail. And there's a number of other things we've done on the lending
side to make it easier for our higher net worth clients to get a mortgage through Schwab. We've also done things
you've seen, I'm sure, with our Investor Advantage Pricing, which makes taking the loan through Schwab as your
client and have assets with us, again among the lowest cost places to get a loan. So we see the opportunity for
meaningful growth here.
Lending environment clearly is challenging. So we're not seeing the returns to those investments just yet that we
might otherwise have seen. But what's important is we are laying the foundation for when the lending environment
is appealing. More and more clients will turn to Schwab for their lending because we've made it easier, we've
made it more seamless, we've made it even less costly, and there should be no better place to take a Pledged
Asset Line or a mortgage than through your relationship here at Schwab. So we feel confident that when the
lending environment improves, we're going to be there.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. You may go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick Moley Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. I just wanted to go back to the $500 million of incremental cost saves. Wondering if you could elaborate a
little more on the areas that those cost saves are coming from. Walt mentioned real estate savings as a driver.
And I know last week, you announced that you were downsizing or closing offices, and I think [indiscernible]
(00:50:47). So just wondering if you could maybe quantify the impact from that reduction in the real estate
footprint, and then maybe how much of that was already baked into the AMTD integration cost saves that you
guided to, and how much of that is maybe newer? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter William Bettinger A
Co-Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Sure. Thanks. So, all of it is incremental, and none of that was baked into the Ameritrade integration saves. I think
one of the items that's important to understand is that over the last several years, as we began preparation for the
integration, we recognized that having that go smoothly for the new clients from Ameritrade that would be joining
Schwab was the single most important thing we could do. And so when it came to spending and investing, the
answer was yes, an awful lot.
In fact, if you look at our current expenses today and compare them to the sum of what Schwab and Ameritrade's
expenses were at the time of the announcement of the acquisition, they're about 20% higher than they were at
that date. And so this fairly significant ramp up of hiring and expenses that we have incurred in the last three
years to ensure this integration went well, we now will be faced with the opportunity to unwind that.

So, when I talk about $500 million-plus, in addition to the remaining $500 million from integration from Ameritrade,
that's what gets us to over $1 billion in expense savings that we'll recognize between the remaining months in
2023, as well as, as Peter referenced, in 2024 from the integration wrapping up.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. You may go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. I'm assuming the repayment expectations for short-term funding through 2024 is in part driven
by the growing client cash and in part by the shrinking securities portfolio. So my question is on the securities
portfolio specifically, if I look at average balances, they were down about 4.3% sequentially, or $14 billion. I
guess, when you look at the current maturity schedule and expectation for prepayments in the current interest
rate environment, what are your updated expectations on how that securities portfolio – how the balances could
trend over the next 6 months or maybe 12 months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford A
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
So the way I think about it is, in terms of – when we think about it, we think about sort of the principal and interest
payments off the securities portfolio, and we use that as a mechanism to support the cash realignment activity,
and then also to pay down some of the short-term borrowings. And that's tracking about 5-ish billion dollars per
month, $15 billion per quarter.
As that portfolio shrinks, that – of course, those monthly cash flows will decrease modestly. But even in through
next year, we'd still expect that to – those monthly – that monthly activity to be $4 billion plus, $4 billion to $5
billion, somewhere in that range over the course of 2024 as well.

And just, operator, looking at the clock, I think we have time for one last question before we wrap.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. You may go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Most questions have been asked here. Maybe just one kind of [indiscernible] (00:54:43)
on the model, securities lending revenues have been bouncing back here a little bit, and just want to get a – and
that move the NIM around. So, want to get a sense of how you guys think about kind of a normalized model of
securities lending, and if we should just be looking for kind of what's happening to capital markets? I know when
there's more active maybe IPO market or capital markets environment, that can be better. So just thinking about
what's going to move that back to levels that were, I think healthier back in late 2021?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford A
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yeah. So, you're right. So securities lending revenue does move around. It can move around month-to-month,
day-to-day, frankly, based off of, oftentimes, demand for a relatively small number of hard-to-borrow stocks, and
that's really what we focus on is the hard-to-borrow stocks. We're the largest lender in the industry for those hard-

to-borrow stocks. And many times, they are event driven, whether it's a SPAC or de-SPAC situation or IPO or
whatever it might be.
I think, over time – I guess, I would say, two things. One is, over time, we would expect that securities lending
revenue to grow with the growth in margin balances because that creates more inventory and the growth in our
total client assets. At the same time, we see a significant opportunity to continue to grow sec lending revenue,
sort of irrespective of what happens with balances.
We've talked previously about the combination of the green and blue sec lending capabilities on the Ameritrade
side has access to more hard-to-borrow stocks, but on the on the blue side, on the Schwab side, we have had
some more advanced capabilities, such as a fully – a more mature fully paid program. And so, we're very, very
excited about that combination and continue to unlock the significant opportunities that combination provides.
And, for example, making more of our clients aware of the fully paid opportunities. So, I think we see that as a
revenue synergy from the combination and a great opportunity moving forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Okay. And I think that we said that was our last question. So, let me just close us out here as we're getting to the
bottom of the hour. There's no doubt that the last few months have presented some challenges for our clients, our
people and our business. And while I spoke at the outset about the metaphorical fog that has obscured, I think,
the enduring quality of the Schwab franchise. And as we're sitting here today in this 100 degree Texas heat, it
feels like that fog is starting to clear.
And as it does, I think what you see as a company building loyalty among clients that is among the highest in the
industry, producing consistent 5% to 7% organic growth, positions strongly in the two fastest-growing segments in
wealth management, delivering consistent profitability, highlighted by a 42% adjusted pre-tax margin during one
of our toughest quarters in a long time, and pursuing a lot of opportunities with the Ameritrade integration and
beyond to drive growth and to deliver even greater efficiency.
And as I hope you've gleaned over this past hour, we remain very confident about the path forward and our future,
and we look forward to discussing our continued progress with you at our next update in October. Thanks,
everyone.
