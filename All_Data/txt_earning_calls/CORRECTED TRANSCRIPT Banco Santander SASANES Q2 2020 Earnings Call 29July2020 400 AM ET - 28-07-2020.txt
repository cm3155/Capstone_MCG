Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Good morning to everyone. Thank you for attending this second quarter results presentation. So as you
have well known, the quarter has been a very challenging; the environment was significantly deteriorated by the
pandemia. And in this environment, this difficult environment, the bank has delivered a solid operating
performance despite the economic environment.
So, during the second quarter, we were able to continue the performance trend set during the previous quarters in
activity and underlying results. In terms of activity, the bank has extended substantial financial support to its
customers to help them through the pandemic. Stock continued to grow in our two regions and our digital
adoption has accelerated a lot.
We are starting to see signs of normalization in retail new lending, particularly in Europe, with mortgage and
consumer and new business increasing. SMEs and corporates were supported by the existing government
guarantee programs. CIB reduced from the peak in April. I will talk more in-depth about the different segments of
the activity.
The strong top line performance given the current market context with a net operating income increase of 2%,
driven by resilient customer revenue and our cost reduction plan, minus 5% year-on-year in real terms. The cost
reductions are ahead of plan driven by successful spends margin in the last few years and additional savings
measures adopted since the beginning of the crisis.
Higher loan-loss provisions based on the application of [indiscernible] (00:02:36) we outlined to you in the
previous quarter. The total loan-loss provisions are €7 billion in the first half of the year and underlying profit of
€1.5 billion in the quarter, €1.9 billion in the first half 2020. However, as a result of the pandemic, the bank has
completed a review of the valuation of the bank goodwill held against past acquisitions and of the tax credits
carryforward. We recorded a noncash, nonrecurring impairment charge of €12.6 billion, resulting in an statutory
attributable loss for the first half of €10.8 billion. I will explain in the details later.
Additionally, we have strengthened the balance sheet. We maintained the estimation of the cost of credit that we
gave to you in first Q expecting to reach 1.4%, 1.5% at year-end with very good credit quality supported by
mitigation measures that we've been taking. Furthermore, we reinforced our capital position in the quarter,
delivered on a strong organic capital generation of 28 basis points in the quarter with group CET1 reaching
11.84% at the top end of the bank's 11%, 12% target after the accrual of 6 basis points of core equity Tier 1
capital in the quarter to allow the flexibility to pay a cash dividend from 2020 earnings.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
In addition, the board's intention is to propose to shareholders the payment of a scrip dividend [ph] payable in
shares in 2019 (00:04:12) as soon as possible depending on the macro and the regulatory requirements, the
intention of the board is to go to 100% cash dividend, as I said, as soon as possible.
Going to the P&L, so we deliver a strong performance. Exchange rates has had a significant impact, 8 percentage
points in revenues and 6 percentage point in cost. Resilient customer revenue even with lower business activity, a
strong performance on CIB space that is reflected in other income. We accelerate our cost reduction and higher
loan-loss provisions due to COVID-19-related provisions. In Q1, these were within the provision overlay, which we
included in the net capital gains and provisions, but have now been allocated by country in this line. You have the
details in the appendix.
As a result, second quarter underlying attributable profit of €1,531 million driven first half 2020 results of €1.9
billion after absorbing €7 billion of loan-loss provision. We have also recorded nonrecurring charges, which I am
going to explain and break down in the following slide.
Every year, usually in the Q4, group evaluates whether the adjustment of the goodwill generated in the acquisition
of the subsidiaries is necessary in the quarter following the trigger events occurring, requiring an earlier review.
This is a very special economic situation. The changes in the economic environment has been very, very, very,
very high.
We expect GDP to contract in all the countries in which we operate and anticipate a two, three-year recovery
period. At the same time, we have lower-for-longer interest rates with significant decreases in many jurisdictions.
And we also increased the discount rates to reflect the market volatility and higher risk premiums when we
discounted the future cash flows.
So the analysis of [ph] value-induced (00:06:23) guidance and its comparison with the group value results in a
total goodwill impairment of €10.1 billion, of which €4 billion is the result of a 1 percentage point increase in the
discount rate. By country, you can see [indiscernible] (00:06:40) slide: Santander UK, €6.1 billion; US, €2.3 billion;
Poland, €1.2 billion; and Consumer Finance, €500 million, some in Nordic, some in Germany.
Additionally, the economic environment also affect our capacity to use the tax credits carryforward in the short
run, especially those that are registered in Spain, the Spanish consolidated fiscal group. As a result, we also
recorded a €2.5 billion impairment to deferred tax assets. The impairments, as you know, are noncash items,
have no impact on our market position and credit risk position, and are neutral in CET1 capital. Nevertheless, we
remain optimistic that the growth potential in the markets in which we operate and this impairment does not reflect
in any case the importance of the markets in which we operate and how core are for us.
Going for capital, we continue to build capital in the quarter. We generate 28 basis points organic capital in the
quarter due to higher net profit, management of risk weighted assets and increased securitizations. This, together
with the positive regulatory impact, driven by the expected European regulation of capital requirements, CRR2
quick fix, measures led to a total increase of 52 basis points. On the other hand, there were several nonrecurring
impacts in the quarter, such as Ebury acquisition and negative impacts coming from FX mainly and some from
pensions.
All of this results in a CET1 of 11.84% and the management buffer of circa 300 basis points versus 189 basis
points pre-COVID-19. Today, we have a greater visibility than a few months ago. We [ph] do not believe
(00:08:40) that we're going to destroy capital. Conversely, we think it's more feasible to pay dividends. So we

have it included in this capital position, the sale of Puerto Rico – not the sale of Puerto Rico, no, the potential
impact of the software deduction that may come. [indiscernible] (00:09:01) that will be in the region of north of 20
basis points impact.
So going to the activity, let me – to guide you through the activity in the quarter. First on the operational side, the
bank has operated remarkably well in all the geographic areas. The business continuity was not compromised
and we haven't had any relevant incident. At the same, we continue to serve our customers with the attention they
deserve. Currently, nearly 90% of our branches are open. We strengthened our corporate centers capabilities and
we are over 37,500 ATMs [indiscernible] (00:09:45) the group working as usual.
As our point of sale turnover has recovering near to pre-crisis levels following 25% turnover growth from the low
reached in April. Also, we started to gradually return to our usual workplace in some countries at the end of May,
always following the recommendation of the local government respecting the individuals' needs of each
employee.
When it comes to the financial activity, you have on the screen the retail new lending. While we are seeing some
signs of normalization, particularly [ph] intense in Europe, also in the US, less intense (00:10:24) in Latin America.
In Europe, as you can see, mortgage lending new business is recovering, particularly in UK and Spain. North
America and South America are below pre-crisis levels with South America more affected as some restrictions
still apply.
In consumer lending, recovering quickly in all the European countries with Nordics above [ph] pre-COVID
(00:10:46) activity and Germany negative 100% and the Spain and Italy over 70%. We had strong origination
volumes in the US, particularly in prime boosted by [ph] FCA (00:10:59) company. In South America, volumes is
still below pre-COVID despite having spike in April.
When we go to the corporate and CIB lending, let me to remember that this has been a quarter in which we've
been using the credit facilities through the government guarantee programs. Over 630,000 operations have been
formalized amounting for more than €25 million mainly in Spain, also in UK and some in the US.
In lending to SMEs and corporates, in Europe, growth was driven mainly by Spain, in large part due to ICO loans,
and also in the UK Bounce Back Loans and CBILS. North America, group volumes returning to pre-COVID level.
South America, it is still an earlier phase of the crisis and continue to have mixed performance across countries;
Brazil declining month to month while Chile and Argentina having some growth. In CIB, credit growth of €16 billion
since February such in dropdowns across countries in March and first weeks of April [ph] who thought normalizing
in the later (00:12:08) half of the quarter. Much of this liquidity has been placed directly in deposits that grew €24
billion in the quarter.
So, if we go for the geographic areas, you can see the activity. In June, group new lending was similar to pre-
COVID levels. In the second quarter, stock continued to grow in our [ph] key (00:12:33) regions resulting in a 6%
year-on-year increase in loans and 7% growth in customer funds. The stock, you have the stock there. Basically,
retail loans remained fairly stable while corporate and wholesale balance increase across the board.
Finally, as a result of the health crisis, digital adoption has accelerated a lot. Our digital products and services are
becoming more important than ever. We have increased 6 million mobile customers since 2019 growing 22% and
we reached 40 million digital customers in first half 2020. We grew 15% more than in first half of 2019.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
Our digital sales penetration increased to 47% in Q2 versus 36% in 2019. Of note, it was Santander UK with an
exceptional 92% of digital sales of the total in Q2, 76% in the first half of 2020. As a result, we have again
achieved record quarterly figures in the number of digital [ph] services (00:13:46) and transactions.
Going to the group earnings, let me just start with revenue. I will qualify the revenue as I did at the beginning, very
resilient with significant growth in the Americas. North America's still growing and Europe some decrease, mainly
due to the fee income line as a result of lower activity. Well, overall, as I said at the beginning, very resilient
revenue as the result of our business model that is characterized by strong relationship with our customers.
You go to different parts of the revenue lines, different revenue lines. NII was €16.2 billion, basically flat compared
with the previous year. So, although internally we have significant changes, better, higher volumes, the impact of
the lower interest rates, some regulatory impact, particularly in Brazil with overdrafts and the very high liquidity
buffer, the highest ever, that has implications in the cost but overall flat NII in constant currency.
Going to the fee income, we have like the three walls here: the Retail Banking that suffer naturally the lack of
activity in the quarter, the lower volumes of transactions mainly in Europe, and regulatory changes in several
units. The Americas remained broadly stable. From the business point of view, of note is Wealth Management &
Insurance, CIB increased fees and represent 47% of the group fees. This quarter, we can perceive a gradual
recovery in net fee income associated with normalization of the activity in retail. Point-of-sale and card turnover
increased 25% and 28% between April and June after the sharp plunge of 24% year-on-year [indiscernible]
(00:15:50).
In Wealth Management & Insurance, volume show positive year-on-year growth in Santander Asset Management
driven by market movements and positive net sales in May and June. In Insurance, new production has started to
recover pre-crisis levels in the second quarter, mainly in Latin America. In CIB, the valuation has been very good,
20% up the fee income driven by Global Transaction Banking, Global Debt Financing, and the Global Markets.
Our strategy remain focused on increasing loyalty and growing higher value-added products and services, and we
are more optimistic for the coming quarters.
Costs, as I mentioned at the beginning, 5% lower in real terms reflecting our successful management in this
space. We are accelerating the cost reduction trends in most markets, notably in Spain, minus 10%; UK, minus
6%; and US, minus 4%. This allow us to be ahead of schedule in our cost reduction plan and [ph] recapture
(00:16:58) incremental cost efficiency. We have already achieved efficiencies in Europe, over €300 million year-
to-date. We represent 75% of the initial full year 2020 target.
The efficiency ratio remained broadly in line with the previous year at 47%. That is remarkable in this
environment. And we believe that the management that we plan to do by region and the [ph] lessons learned
(00:17:25) from the management of the pandemic will enable us to accelerate our transformation plan in the
future and, consequently, further optimize costs while improving customer experience. We are optimistic about
the cost evolution in the coming quarters.
So [ph] going to (00:17:44) credit quality, we recorded a loan-loss provisions, as I mentioned before, of €7 billion,
€3.9 billion first quarter, €3.1 billion second quarter. As a result, we still expect the cost of risk of the group to be in
the region of 1.4%, 1.5%, as we had already mentioned. So, the traditional measures of credit quality at this stage
do not apply that much, NPL remained fairly flat. So, all these provisions are based on the models plus applying
the scenarios to the model, as you know.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
Having said that, let me to give you some color about what's going on in our loan book. As we mentioned in the
previous quarter, payment holidays have been – the amount of customers affected that got a payment holidays
has been significant, more than 5 million customers got some kind of moratoria for a total amount of €116 billion.
Close to 80% of this amount is granted to individuals of which around 90% is secure lending. The vast majority is
mortgage related and it represents 60% and is more concentrated in our highly collateralized UK portfolio.
Moreover, as 100% are legislative moratoria, a large majority of the customers in the UK have requested the
payment holiday as a way to benefit from favorable financial conditions. Indeed circa 90% of these customers do
not have any arrears on record.
Consumer accounts for 20% of the moratoria, of which [indiscernible] (00:19:26) is auto loans. Such a moratoria
is shortened typically two or three month and this is starting to expire, and I will provide you some data [ph]
immediately (00:19:36).
Just 6% of the SME and corporate portfolio is under moratoria, and these complemented with new liquidity
facilities backed by government guarantees by more than €20 billion, as I mentioned before. In summary,
according to our internal risk analysis, 75% of the portfolio subject to moratoria is defined as a low risk although
it's still early given the uncertainty levels to draw final conditions.
Let me to share with you what's going on with this portfolio, as well as the current moratoria expired. As you can
[indiscernible] (00:20:11), close to 90% of the moratoria will mature in 2020, of which 25% had already expired as
of 30th of June and 50% more will do so in the next three months. Although it's still too early to draw any
conclusions in expired volumes, we can see that the current expirations are behaving with no material deviation
from their normal behaviors. Of the total expired at 30th of June, circa €29 billion, 98% remains performing. More
than 60% are residential mortgage, mainly concentrated in the UK €18 billion. 30% is consumer, of which 90%, €8
billion, is auto mainly in SCUSA.
Concerning SMEs & Corporates, as of June, the expired loans are concentrated mainly in Brazil. We are
reinforcing local recoveries teams. These moratoria and the early performance of expired payment holidays were
taken into account when calculated the estimated cost of credit [indiscernible] (00:21:24) of 140 basis points, 150
basis points. As of 15th of July, more than €40 million of these loans had expired maintaining similar credit quality
and only 2% of the total had entered into Stage 3.
So, maybe to handle now to Jose that he's going to elaborate to different business areas – regions and business
areas in the quarter.

José Antonio García Cantera
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head of Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José Antonio, and good morning, everyone. As previously mentioned, group net operating income
was again supported by the bank's geographic and business diversification. North and South America grew their
operating income while the performance of Europe was impacted by the economic environment, showing the
different stages in the evolution of the pandemic. We had an outstanding performance in our global businesses,
both in net operating income and profit enhancing our local scale with global reach.
As mentioned, our Corporate & Investment bank grew profits by 23% achieving double-digit growth in all of its
main businesses but particularly in global markets and global debt financing. Also, Wealth Management &
Insurance expanded its profits based on sound revenue and flat costs.

Now, moving on to the countries. Let's start with Spain. In the period, heavily impacted by the state of alarm. We
led in amongst Spanish banks the response to the economic crisis. It is worth mentioning the implementation of
[ph] Plan de Ayuda (00:23:06) help plan or aid plan to protect our most vulnerable customers with more than
170,000 joining the mortgage consumer and car payment holiday measures.
From the outset, we've been the most proactive bank in ICO funding. And thanks to process automatization, we
granted €20 billion of ICO loans in over 150,000 operations which represents a market share of 27%. Customer
funds were 2% lower year-on-year, impacted by the fall in time deposits and mutual funds may lead you to
market's performance. However, customer deposits grew 6% in the quarter. Underlying attributable profit
amounted to €251 million in the quarter, 64% down year-on-year, obviously driven by higher provisions.
In addition, total income decreased due to lower net interest income, basically lower rates. [indiscernible]
(00:24:07) explain the majority of this drop and also lower net fee income due to reduced transaction volumes.
These impacts were partially offset by double-digit cost reduction as a result of the optimization processes carried
out. Looking forward, we would expect to see improved trend in net interest income boosted by higher volumes as
it was the case quarter-on-quarter and also we will see further cost reduction.
Santander Consumer Finance, we are starting to see strong signs of recovery in most of the markets where it
operates. New car sales in Europe dropped almost 40% in the first half while new lending in Santander Consumer
Finance fell by less than half due to the strong performance in January and February. The largest falls in the
business were in Southern Europe while Northern Europe less affected by the lockdown held up better.
As the CEO already explained, new businesses have bounced back considerably in recent weeks, approaching
pre-crisis levels in many markets or even exceeding as it is the case in the Nordics. Net interest income increased
3% driven by strong loan growth year-on-year particularly in Northern Europe. However, net fee income which is
directly related to the fall in new car sales decreased 16%. Costs were down 4% year-on-year, 8% quarter-on-
quarter due to the efficiency programs that we had launched already before the COVID. Loan loss provisions
increased to historically high levels. But the cost of credit, the cost of risk remains at low level for this type of
business. As a result, underlying profits fell 26% although rebounded 19% in the quarter.
In the UK, volumes continued to grow healthily, loans rose 4% year-on-year. Underlying attributable profit
continued to be impacted by revenue pressures. Net interest income affected by that base rate reduction and the
SVR and net fee income affected by lower transactionality and regulatory changes to overdrafts. There was also
unexpected significant impact on loan loss provisions.
We have reason to expect however an improvement for the rest of the year. We have reduced the rates on the
1I2I3 World accounts in May. And we have announced a further reduction in August. Additionally, funding from
the Bank of England's term funding scheme has significantly reduced funding cost. Both of these will support net
interest income over the rest of the year.
Moreover, our transformation program is driving the 5% year-on-year drop [ph] in cost 6% (00:27:10) in real
terms. Our credit quality remains strong. Related to payment holidays that had been granted as previously
mentioned, the majority are mortgages with very high quality borrowers who have requested a holiday due to its
favorable financial conditions. Looking forward, we believe that we have weathered the worst of the crisis, and
expect an upward trend in the coming quarters. The UK remains a core strategic market for the group.

Brazil has again proved its balance sheet strength and successful business model, which enabled us to maintain
high returns for our shareholders. Return on tangible equity was 17%. Additionally, we continued to focus on
improving our service quality and this was reflected in a substantial increase in NPS to record levels.
Lending increased 18% year-on-year with all segments growing. Customer funds also rose, boosted by demand
and time deposits. Net operating income rose 5% backed by positive performance of revenues and efforts to
reduce cost. Net interesting come increased slightly, driven by larger volumes which offset margin pressures due
to the change in mix, interest rate cuts, and change of the cheque especial terms, a regulatory change. While net
interest income was impacted by the slowdown in activity. Costs were 1% lower excluding inflation with improved
efficiency year-on-year, 67 basis points down.
The group net operating income was not reflected in underlying attributable profit because, obviously, higher
provisions which also led to an increase in cost of credit but within our expectations. In short, the bank continues
its excellent performance even in a more difficult environment.
During the pandemic, Santander US has remained focused on supporting its customers, employees, and
communities while pursuing its strategic priorities. In the bank, in SBNA, we continued our digital and branch
transformation while enhancing our auto finance partnership with Santander Consumer focused on prime loans.
In Santander Consumer, we had disciplined originations through our dealer network, enhancing our partnership
with Fiat Chrysler and SBNA, and the bank. Loans were boosted by the Paycheck Protection Program. In
Santander Consumer, originations declined in March and April but have recovered later in the quarter driven by
FCA initiative programs. Underlying attributable profit decreased 56% year-on-year due primary to provisions
which increased almost 50%. Compared to the previous year, underlying attributable profit was 1.5 times –
[indiscernible] (00:30:11) 150% higher due to lower costs, loan loss provisions, and reduced minority interest.
In summary, we had a solid volume growth in the quarter and in previous quarters. We've doubled profits in the
last two years, and we have strengthened our capital position as shown in the stress test. This is the result of the
continuous improvement in our franchise, and we believe we can continue to grow and add value in a key market
for us.
In Mexico, the bank continued with its debtor support program, [ph] aid (00:30:44) individuals and SMEs. In
addition, a significant number of branches operated with reduced staff. Digital channels and contact centers
worked normally. Digital activity increased substantially year-on-year with a 38% increase in mobile customers,
45% in transactions, and digital sales penetration is now 11 percentage points higher than in the first half of 2019.
Loan growth was driven by corporates, CIB, and mortgages. Quarter-on-quarter obviously it was impacted by the
slowdown in the use of credit lines from corporates and CIB, following the strong growth that we had in the month
of March. Net operating income increased 11% year-over-year supported by positive revenue performance and
improved efficiency. Costs show a better trend than in previous quarters and the efficiency ratio improved by more
than 2 percentage points. Underlying attributable profit rose 4% year-on-year which benefited which benefited
from reduced non-controlling interests. In short, very positive trend reflecting the improvement of our franchise in
recent years.
And finally in the corporate center, the first thing that I wanted to say is that it continues to play a critical role in
supporting the group through the special situation committees. Also starting in May, the progressive
reincorporation of employees to the workplace began with a mixture of onsite and remote working always
following government and health authority recommendations maintaining a high level of flexibility to meet
individual needs.

With regard to results, underlying attributable loss is flat compared to 2019, mainly due to the combination of on
the one hand, the positive impact of the foreign currency hedging which is reflected in financial transactions of
€250 million and a 4% reduction in costs. On the other hand, net interest income was negatively affected by larger
liquidity buffer where the revaluation of some small stakes is reflected in provisions.
And now, I will hand it back to José Antonio for his concluding remarks. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José. Let me to conclude and go back to the questions you may have. So, the second quarter as I
said at the very beginning continue to – we operate under specific conditions that were not the best to deliver in
terms of our business.
Having said that, as I mentioned at the beginning, operationally, we served very well, I would say, our customers
and we were able to keep the business going. So, as a result of this situation, the management of the situation,
we mentioned already, we continue with strong capital. We generate significant capital in the quarter, organic
capital generation and we maintained our core target in the top of our 11%, 12% range.
As I mentioned before and given the strength of the bank's capital underlying performance, the bank has accrued
6 basis points of CET1 capital in Q2, allowing the option to pay dividend from 2020 earnings. On top of that, we
have an intention to pay a scrip dividend payable in shares before the year-end and coming back to 100% cash
dividend when this is feasible from the macro point of view and from the regulatory point of view.
We delivered strong performance from pre-provision profits, resilient income and cost reduction accelerating. In
second half of this year, we expect to recover our customer revenue via NII and fees and to continue to delivering
on our cost reduction ahead of our plans.
We have good credit quality, so we maintain the cost of credit after the – some of the customers, the moratoria
expired, and we shared with you the data, this continue to be consistent with our expectation of cost of risk for this
year.
In summary, I would say our business model's strength and execution of our strategy continue to show resilience
across different cycles. This is helped by the group's strong pre-provision profit, the amount of credit [ph] we
service for €25 billion (00:35:26) and the fact in all the stress test, capital destroyed is significantly lower than our
competitors. This makes us confident of our future performance and our ability to continue to generate capital.
Finally, accelerating our transformation plans are key. For this reason, we accelerate in our transformation plans
to leverage both our scale and the collective strength on our regions and global businesses, are focusing on
simplifying our operational improving customer experience to grow profitability, and with improved efficiency, have
learned from customer behavior changes during the pandemic and from our own operational experience.
I'm convinced that all of this will enable us to work more efficiently, which combined with greater integration
should be reflected in an increase to our profitability. All these elements make our net operating income forecasts
consistent with our [ph] investor-grade (00:36:30) medium-term targets. That's all on our side, and now, we have
time for questions. Sergio, take the lead.

Thank you, José Antonio. Thanks, José. Indeed, we have now time for Q&A, so please let's proceed with the
session first question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the Q&A session starts now. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first
question comes from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just one on the dividend and another one on impairments. On the
dividend, just the mandatory scrip, just the rationale behind it given it has no impact on valuation and given it's
certainly affecting the perception among institutional investors, what's the rationale behind it? And you've also
pointed out that you're going to move in cash dividend. Just wanted to discuss – if you can discuss the visibility –
obviously on the macro, we understand visibility is what it is, but I'm more asking about regulatory headwinds. The
ECB announced that TRIM exercises are back live now. So, how comfortable are you that the visibility is better
from a regulatory perspective and given you were going to move in cash last year? And so, what makes you more
comfortable there?
And the second question on impairments, I don't know if you can maybe, after the call, share some of the
assumptions behind the impairments on the DTAs and goodwill impairments. And will that – are you comfortable
now that we should not have any further impacts on tangible value going forward from extraordinary ones, of
course? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Alvaro, thank you for your question. The first one is the rationale behind the mandatory scrip. So, you say,
as you know, our shareholder base – north of 40% on the shareholder base are retail shareholders, and they've
been quite vocal on this asking us for keeping some kind of remuneration in scrip. That's the main rationale. I
know that the share count goes up, and this is probably something that may not please some institutional
investors, but we need to take into account all our shareholder base, institutionals and retail shareholders.
So, the second question, regulatory, well, we also want to stress to you and to state to you that the board's
intention is to go back to cash dividend as soon – to 100% cash dividend as soon as we can. [ph] And this line
(00:39:22), we accrued 6 basis points roughly speaking €400 million as the intention is the profit generation goes
accordingly with our expectations to keep accruing dividend in the coming quarters. And we think that the ECB
regulatory – the ECB position on this as cannot be our way, is going to be regulated with the capacity of banks to
keep generating profits along this cycle.
As long as we are forecasting a recurring capacity to generate profits, we accrue dividend that shows the board
intention to pay dividend in cash and we continue to generate profits. Naturally, there are two uncertainties here.
One is on the macro side, if we are on the macro and the profits are not the ones we expected, it may happen.
We are not in this line. We think that we're going to keep generating profit, recurring profits. And the second one is

the recommendations from the regulator that it may be will depend more on the capacity of the banks not to
destroy capital during the crisis.
The impairment, assumptions for the impairment, so basically, the impairment I mentioned three factors behind
these. The first one and the most important one is the macro situation that deteriorates significantly the profits in
the very short run, not in the medium term. This is more in the short run. As you have seen, this quarter, we're
reporting a significant low profits, I mean, underlying profits than the ones we were reporting one year ago as a
result of the health crisis. This is going to affect for two years, three years as I mentioned before and this has an
impact.
The reaction of the central banks to this situation in many jurisdictions has been to reduce rates, particularly in US
and UK where this has some effect. The first part, the health crisis, they're relating to higher loan loss provisions,
the second part put pressure on NII.
And, finally, we increased the discount rate, on average 1%. Not in all jurisdictions, it's the same but take the 1%
as a round number, more in some jurisdictions, less in others, as a result of the higher market volatility and as a
result, higher risk premiums and this has an impact of, I mentioned – I think I mentioned in the presentation of €4
billion – out of the €10 billion, €4 billion is due to the higher discount rate and €6 billion coming from the other two
factors I mentioned.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Ulargui Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. The first – I have one question only, if you could elaborate a bit on what is
the outlook for pre-provisioning profit at a group level into the second half, with the different moving parts from
revenues and costs? And whether that 2Q number is really the information that we have today at the bottom of
2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. I'm not sure we elaborate a bit about this that we are expecting a – well, a lot of this depends naturally on
the – but the scenario in which we are working is having somehow new normality, what is called new normality,
somehow in Europe and in US with some still a activity that is at the current levels, not 100% back because
probably this is not going to be possible till we get an efficient treatment for the COVID or a vaccine being widely
spread. So, we are working with a scenario close to the one we have today in Europe and US and Latin America
coming back to certain normality in the next two months. So, this is scenario with which we are working.
In this scenario, we should be able to recover our NII. As we mentioned, I'm fairly positive on NII. We are re-
pricing liabilities in many of jurisdictions, particularly in terms as José mentioned in the UK. As you know,
jurisdictions and NII should have certain strength in the second quarter and to recover something that will last as
a result of the lockdown, particularly in Europe. I showed you the numbers. And the effect on fee income was due
to significantly lower activity during the lockdown.

As long as we don't have lockdowns – and this is the hypothesis I'm making – we should have a stronger pre-
provision profit in the second half of the year than the one we've had in the first half of the year. And I do not see
in this scenario – again, uncertainty in the scenarios is that higher provisions than the one we recorded in the first
half of the year. So, that's my assumption for the rest of the year.

Fernando Gil De Santivanes Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions from my side. First is can you please
remind those the book value of the UK and US after these goodwills impairments? This is one. Second is can you
please refresh the [ph] assets' changed (00:45:28) sensitivity going forward in the P&L? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
So do you have the figures for UK and US. Remember it's – €12 billion...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head of Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
€12 billion UK.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
€12 billion UK, it's in our quarterly report, like I am speaking by memory, €12 billion UK. Sergio, you remember the
new number for US? We come back to you and give you the exact figure, but this is published in our annual
report. You have there the book value on the goodwills. The goodwill at the group level was €25 billion, after this
impairment it's going to go to the €15 billion, concentrated mainly and speaking by memory in Brazil, Mexico, and
very little in UK after this impairment, very little in US.
So, this is – I think Alvaro, your colleague, asked me in the first question, I didn't address this, the further impacts
of the impairments in TNAV, no, I do not see any further impairments that affect TNAV. TNAV, I do not see further
impairments impact when [ph] we do impairment tests (00:46:47) only when it comes negative, [ph] you record it
(00:46:51). In many cases, it's positive, and when we compare the [ph] discount cuts (00:46:56), future expected
cash flows with the current market value.
FX impact...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head of Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
As you know, we have a policy of hedging tactically the P&L. It is hedged for the rest of the year mostly. Almost all
currencies are hedged for the rest of the year. And we have started already to hedging some of the position for

next year, particularly the US dollar to Mexican peso and the Brazilian real. It's not fully hedged next year but we
have started to do it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
But let me to elaborate on this. Well, the FX this first half of the year impact has been intense. The depreciation of
emerging markets currency [indiscernible] (00:47:45) significant across the board. In general, the euro strength is
there. And what we expect going forward is after this depreciation not having additional significant depreciation
impact other than the one that may come from maybe high inflation countries, in our case it's basically Argentina
but I could be more constructive on FX in Mexico and Brazil. That are the two most important countries.
Given the fact that they think the markets are taking overly negative view over the developments in those
countries. And as you can see in our figures, we are seeing the activity and the levels of activity and the capacity
to generate profits in those markets continues to be relatively strong. And this means that economies handling the
crisis better than I think many market participants are thinking, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sergio Gámez Toro A
Global Head-Shareholder & Investor Relations, Banco Santander SA
Just as a follow up, if I may. Carrying value from the UK is €14 billion, €6 billion SCUSA, and €10 billion SBNA.
And out of the – post impairment €12 billion goodwill for the entire group, Brazil represents around €3 billion. But
obviously I'm happy to catch up in more detail about the numbers after the call.
Next question, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: The next question comes from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrea Filtri Q
Analyst, Mediobanca SpA (United Kingdom)
Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Could you please update us on IFRS 9 charges, where are you
on those? And what macro scenario you're reflecting now? Are you envisaging further COVID charges in H2
2020? What sort of capital headwinds do you envisage from risk weighted asset pro-cyclicality as macro
deteriorates in the coming quarters? And are there any pending TRIM impacts left at this stage? You said that you
confirmed the 1.4% to 1.5% cost of risk guidance, reflecting the benefits of the moratoria. What would this be
without that? And just finally, what is the TLTRO III benefit to come I guess from Q3 onwards? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Plenty of questions, Andrea. I'm going to address some of them, others if I could pass to José. IFRS 9
charge is what is reflected in our loan loss provision. We are working with, naturally, with our models in the
scenario that I mentioned. We haven't changed the scenario. It's the one I mentioned in the previous quarter that
is not exactly but very much in line with what IMF scenario was at this time. We haven't changed this. So, do we
expect further COVID-related provisions? Unless we have a different scenario going forward, I do not expect
additional that are already embedded in our numbers.
The second question is risk weighted asset pro-cyclicality, [indiscernible] (00:51:14) pro-cyclicality already
happening. So, we are – this rate immigration and we are already including. We have some rate immigration
particularly or in some cases significant rate immigration particularly in the CIB space. It happens on a continuous

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
basis and it's going to be reflected quarter-after-quarter, yeah. So including the second quarter where the pro-
cyclicality was significant and is included in our organic capital generation, okay?
The TRIM impacts, José, maybe you want to take this one. The moratoria, as I mentioned, does not help in the
cost of risk. And so the cost of risk at this stage comes from the application of scenarios to the models. If we were
recording costs of risk based on observation like it was in the past, the cost of risk of would be significantly lower.
We take into account naturally all the moratorias, what is going on with the moratorias because, well, naturally this
is – but the majority of the cost of risk comes from – the extra cost of risk comes from the models.
Would you want to elaborate in TRIM impact [indiscernible] (00:52:38) TLTRO III.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head of Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. With regards to TRIM [ph] and OCs (00:52:42) we have the most significant one is the TRIM on Spain's
SMEs that was put on hold last year [ph] to drive help (00:52:54) lending to this sector. And that obviously with the
end of the extraordinary conditions this may come back. It could be up to 16 basis points and then we have some
other smaller [ph] OCs (00:53:09) that might happen before the end of the year although some might be
postponed for next year, could be up to 5 basis points. So, worst case scenario I think we're talking tops 20 basis
points. And with regard to the TLTRO, we increased TLTRO in the region of €17 billion relative to what we had
last year.

Operator: The next question comes from Sofie Peterzéns from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sofie Peterzéns Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah. Hi. Here is Sofie Peterzéns from JPMorgan. I had a question on the NII outlook. You've mentioned that
volume growth was very strong and NII was holding up quite well in the quarter. But how should we think about
the NII outlook in Spain going forward?
And my second question would be on your TNAV. It was down around 5% quarter-on-quarter. Are you doing
anything to keep the TNAV a little bit more stable going forward? Have you any hedges in place and how should
we think about the TNAV growth going forward?
And the last question would be just a follow-up on the previous question. What kind of macro assumptions do you
have for your various geographies, for example in Spain, are you using the Bank of Spain macro scenarios? Or
how are you thinking about the macro picture in your different markets? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Sofie, for your questions. Let me to elaborate in the NII in UK going forward. So as José
mentioned in the presentation, probably we've seen the worst already in the first, second quarter. So it's a
liabilities repricing exercise that is going on and we're starting to see these starting in May is going to accelerate
[indiscernible] (00:55:11) will go back to kind of normal in the fourth quarter. So, accelerating this probably in the

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
fourth quarter, we should go back to what we had the previous year. And after the repricing of all the liabilities,
that's the reason why we said and José said that we're optimistic on the NII evolution in the UK. This is basically a
liability repricing across all the deposit ratio.
Second related to TNAV, question to José going forward, macro assumptions. You mentioned specifically Spain.
We are working in the region of 10% GDP decrease this year and a significant recovery next year. I don't
remember exactly the number but I think was 7% or 6% or 7% next year. As I said to you, our SG&A is not far
away from maybe a bit better or a bit worse country by country but on average not significantly different than the
one of IMF. The TNAV, do you want to elaborate on this, José?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head of Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
No. I mean the TNAV, José Antonio already said that if you look at the two charges that we made in the first
quarter, obviously, the impairment of goodwill has no impact on TNAV. The DTA is hard and we would not expect
to have any one-offs affecting TNAV going forward. So, obviously, the evolution of TNAV will depend on our
capacity to generate earnings affected by the currency, the evolution of the FX, but as José Antonio said, was
extraordinarily high in the first quarter, in the first half and we would not expect to see the same level of
depreciation of the currencies in the countries where we operate in the second half. So with all the things being
considered, I think we can be quite more optimistic about the TNAV evolution in the coming quarters.

Operator: The next question comes from Mario Ropero from Fidentiis. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mario Ropero Q
Analyst, Fidentiis Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Hi, good morning. My first question is on fees in the UK. Could you please explain how much was the impact of
the regulatory cap on overdrafts and how much you expect to recover in the third quarter? And then the second
question is on loan yields in Spain, which went down significantly in the quarter despite some marginal help from
Euribor. So is the pressure on yields in Spain due to ICO loans? And what do you suspect in the coming
quarters? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. So fee income in the UK, you rightly [indiscernible] (00:58:02) to overdrafts. As you know, we were not
allowed to apply in the overdrafts. The integration we were planning to apply was a mandatory. And this reduced
our capacity to [indiscernible] (00:58:16). It goes more to the NII than on the other. But we were expecting to lose
net-net between NII and fee income like €100 million, €130 million, €140 million and now we are €100 million
lower than that or something like that. So it's the numbers I have in my mind. So we're going to recover somehow
charging interest on the overdrafts in line with what we want to do but was not allowed to do this quarter. And this
will come back in coming quarters.
Loan yield in Spain is pure mix. So it's through ICO loans came basically in line with the existing loans and the
mix has changed a bit. The consumer lending decreased, the weight of the consumer lending decreased while the
CIB and large corporates increased and this result in a drop in the loan yield that – well, if you ask me going

forward what's going to happen, as long as we recover the level of activity that we are doing right now in the retail
arena, we should be able to recover somehow to the previous levels or even higher levels depending on Euribor,
as you rightly pointed out, that it has an effect. Euribor is like 20% of our portfolio – Euribor mortgages are 20% of
our portfolio.

Operator: The next question comes from Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank BPI. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos Peixoto Q
Analyst, CaixaBank BPI
Hello. Good morning. A couple of questions here. First one would be on the dividend and then on the dividend on
2020 earnings, so if I do some math on the 6 basis points accrued on the first half earnings, it looks as though
you're implying here an 18% to 20% payout ratio are expected payout ratio on 2020 earnings. Is that the case?
Then on NII in Brazil, we witnessed a strong compression in margins and basically with volumes growing at the
healthy pace, I would say. NII was still down. I guess that changes in mix can account for part of this, probably
interest rates as well. But I was wondering how do you see this going forward? So basically, what's the outlook
you see there on NII and also on the cost of risk, by the way? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you. So, dividend 2020, we accrued 6 basis points. Well, this has – I will take the number as the
strong [ph] signaling (01:01:11) effect that provided that the macro conditions remain as we behave as we're
expecting and subject to regulatory recommendations. We don't have in mind any specific payout, but we have in
mind or what the scenario in which we are working is we're going to be at the top end of our core equity Tier 1
target and that is 11%, 12% or going to be close to 12% or around 12%.
And this will allow us to keep a dividend naturally first based upon the profit generation. But I will not take this 6
basis points compared with the profit we generate in the first half as a guidance for the payout for the whole year.
Probably the payout, if we are right in the macro scenario and the profit generation is the one we expect, probably
we can go beyond that, provided we are allowed to do so.
NII in Brazil, so two different – NII in Brazil, there is a product that in Brazil they call cheque especial that is kind of
overdraft in Brazil that the interest rate was very high and the regulator put a cap in this product. This product will
last – well, we were last year we start to reduce our presence in this product and, in fact, our market share was
close to 20%. Now it's 12%. And this is the main impact. So it's a bit of mix. And the main impact comes from this
specific product that has very high [indiscernible] (01:03:00), extremely high cost of risk. So it has an impact in the
NII, a significant impact also in the cost of risk.
So now going forward, you mentioned interest rates. Interest rates are not as important in Brazil as they are in our
jurisdictions given the high reserve requirements. It matters but I will say in the first year probably is a net-net
positive, the impact slightly positive; afterwards may turn a little bit negative. But at the beginning, it's not as
important in our market due to high reserve requirements in the country.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
The main effect come from mixed change due to this specific product and that we have been doing more activity
[ph] in large corporates, meaning (01:03:50) to say that on a like-for-like basis, our spread in Brazil is increasing
significantly so lower volumes, higher spread on a like-for-like basis. The mix and this product are the ones
[indiscernible] (01:04:11) NII.
The cost of risk in Brazil, well, in fact, we are developing or we developed a full plan to address collections and
recoveries in the country, and we do not expect an spike. I think at this stage we are clearly much more optimistic
than my perception where the market is. So we are not seeing that large deterioration. Maybe we, in this
environment, moratoriums are not that high in Brazil. They last only for one or two month. They came back. So I'm
not pessimistic about the outlook of cost of risk in Brazil unless the situation deteriorated further from the macro
due to the health situation of the country. But as I said, I'm not pessimistic on this.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stefan R. Nedialkov Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning. Stefan from Citi. Two questions on my side. The first one is on capital. Have
you've done any synthetic risk securitizations which may or may not have helped your capital in the quarter and
also what's the outlook for synthetic risk securitization for the rest of the year?
The second question is about the moratoria. You gave us some interesting statistics on the nonperforming loan
ratio on moratoria loans that have expired. Just to probe that a little bit further, what's the percent of clients that
were furloughed within that €40 billion of mature moratoria loans? And related to that, are there any geographies
and products that you're not accruing NII for in terms of moratoria loans, for example, Mexico or other countries?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head of Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Okay. So, in terms of securitizations, we did a couple that were really very small, relative to what we thought we
could – that we had in our budget. But they were insignificant. I think it was like €500 million or something of risk
weighted asset, I believe. So it was not significant basically because the market was closed for most of the
quarter, but it has started to open. So we would expect to be a bit more active in the second half, probably not
reaching our expected activity for the year but clearly a bit more active in the second half than in the first half. And
indeed, we are working on a couple of more sizable transactions to be closed over the next few quarters, a few
months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. One question was about the moratoria, the €40 billion, the percentage of the €40 billion that is the
moratoria that's paid as of mid-July, the percentage, I mentioned in the presentation was very much in line, that
went into nonperforming were very much in line with the ones was paid at the end of June in line with the 2%. And
that's what we can share with you at this stage.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2020
And the other questions, Stefan, your question was accruing NII moratoria loans. The majority of the moratoria
loans, I think the only big chunk of moratoria loans that are not paying interest are the mortgages in the UK. Yes,
the majority of the others, they keep paying interest and the moratoria applies to principal. So what we've done,
for example in mortgages in Spain, are not [ph] voluntarily wages (01:08:29) and in other jurisdictions is to keep
paying interest and not paying the principal. So we're accruing interest for example in the UK for the mortgages
that are under moratoria so we accrue.
And in emerging markets, well, emerging markets, as you know, not due to this crisis. So it's the way we accrue
and the way we write down. Remember that in those markets we write down after five, six month all the
consumer-related, credit card-related lending. The write-down happens very quickly, okay? So if the moratoria
when the customers come back to the moratoria and we accrue some interest on this and we get unpaid,
immediately goes, jumps into the write-downs. So it happens. It's not like in mature markets where it takes longer.

Adrian Cighi Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse
Hi there. Hi there. This is Adrian Cighi from Credit Suisse. Thank you for taking my questions. Then I have two
questions please and a brief follow-up. So the first one is you've written off €2.5 billion in DTA citing a
deteriorating outlook, yet you recommit to the 13% to 15% RoTE target. Can you give us any more color as to
how to reconcile the two?
The second question is on costs. You've achieved an impressive performance on cost reduction this quarter
again. And you also note that you're [indiscernible] (01:10:05) to do more. Any chance we can get you to quantify
or provide us a range on some of these potential incremental cost saves? And then maybe a follow-up on cost of
risk and trying to give your outlook in a different way. You mentioned the significant front-loading cost from IFRS 9
models. But would you expect a meaningful decline maybe in cost of risk next year? Thank you.

Okay. So the €2.5 billion DTA is naturally our outlook in the medium term. I mentioned that our outlook hasn't
changed in the medium term provided that the scenario we have in mind works. And I mentioned in the
presentation that the impairment was related with the impacts and profits in this period in the next two years, so
two, three years to recover the previous levels.
What happens with the DTAs, so when you factor these two years or lower profits at the very beginning where the
discount rate has little effect is significant and leads us to this charge. And at the same time, remember that we
put a higher discount rate, so the same applies to the DTAs, higher discount rate that at the end is 40% of the
impairment.
As I said globally, €10 billion in impairments, I said €6 billion coming from outlook, particularly lower profit in the
short run and the rest from the discount rate. The same applies here. So I think it's consistent in the medium-term

target. We are now seeing our capacity generate profits in the markets in which we operate. As we see today, the
market is there and I don't see any reason not to get those targets.
The cost reduction, the second question, the quantified cost savings, our plan is to update later in the year but, for
sure, we are much more optimistic as a result of what has happened in the crisis, the behavior of the customer,
our capacity to operate, our operational capabilities that [ph] we're showing (01:12:24) the crisis for sure. And
we're going to produce higher cost reductions than the ones we commit to you in Europe that is, as you know,
were €1 billion nominal drop in costs in Europe. We already got €300 million in the first half, sorry. Thank you,
José. And we're going to achieve easily this target. Yeah, and we will update you once we finish our plans more in
the fall or at the end of the year.
The last question was...

The cost of risk next year [indiscernible] (01:13:06).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Well, I do expect, if we are right with our scenario, I do expect to see a drop next year naturally. So, otherwise, the
macro should be significantly different than the one we have. Again, this is the area in which the uncertainty is
higher. Naturally, we are seeing what is going on with the COVID on a daily basis.
Well, we are working, as I said before, with any scenario in which we live, in the scenario we live today in Europe
and US, with the economy open up to a point, with some restrictions on travel, but operating as of today the
economy for a while till we get a vaccine. [ph] When (01:13:58) we get a vaccine, I think that we should be able to
reduce the cost of risk.

your entire disposal for any follow-up. So thanks very much. See you next quarter.
