Brian T. Moynihan
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Lee, and good morning, and thank all of you for joining us today. Before I begin today, I just want to
reflect a second on the horrible events this weekend. We at Bank of America are clear that there's no place for
political violence in our great country, and we continue to wish the former President Trump a speedy recovery and
our thoughts, of course, go out to the victims and their families and others impacted by this terrible event.
With that, let's turn to our results – with this, let's turn our attention to the results for the second quarter of 2024 at
Bank of America Corporation. This quarter, we achieved success in a number of areas, underscoring the benefits
of our diversity and dedication of our team to deliver responsible growth. Our organic growth continues to add
customers and activity to all our businesses, even as we see the trough in net interest income this quarter. I'm
starting on slide 2.
Our net income for the quarter was $6.9 billion after tax or $0.83 in diluted EPS. Attesting to the balance in our
franchise, the earnings were split evenly, half in our consumer, GWIM businesses, which serve people, and the
other half in our institutional focus business, Global Banking and markets. We grew revenue from the second
quarter 2023 as improvement in non-interest income overcame the decline in net interest income. Fees grew 6%
year-over-year, and represented 46% of total revenue in the quarter.
Our strong fee performance was led by a 14% improvement in asset management fees and our Wealth
Management businesses. We grew investment banking fees 29% year-over-year, and saw sales in trading
revenue increase 7%. Global Markets had its ninth consecutive quarter of the year-over-year growth in sales and
trading revenue, a good job by Jimmy Demare and a team. Card and service charge revenue also grew by 6%
year-over-year in our consumer business.
Much of this fee growth is the result of our intensity around organic growth and is a testament to the diversity of
our operating model.
Now, on to slide 3. Organic growth has been driven by several key factors. First, we focus on our customers. We
continue to place them at the center of everything we do. Consumer-led the way in delivering solid organic growth
with high-quality accounts and engaged clients. For the 22 consecutive quarter, we had significant net new
consumer checking accounts. We expanded our customer base and our market share. Specifically, we added
278,000 net new checking accounts this quarter, which brings our first six months of 2024 to more than 500,000.
In Wealth Management, we added another 6,100 new relationships this quarter and in our commercial
businesses, we added thousands of small businesses and hundreds of commercial banking relationships. This
has led to now managing $5.7 trillion in client balances, loans, deposit, investments across the consumer and
Wealth Management client segments. In those areas we saw flows of $58 billion in the past four quarters.
Our emphasis on personalized financial solutions and superior customer service has strengthened customer
loyalty, attracted new clients across all our businesses. Our focus on providing liquidity and risk management
solutions to our institutional clients, positions to continue to gain more share of their wallets as well.

Second, we continue to deliver innovative digital solutions. One of the primary contributors of both attracting and
retaining customers to our platforms is our digital banking capabilities for our clients across all the businesses.
Our fully integrated Consumer Banking investment app drives the utility for our customers across their investment
and consumer accounts. Our use of stats are strong proof points. Our second language capabilities in our
consumer businesses further enhance our customers' capabilities.
You can see the continued digital growth in the slides on pages 26, 28, and 30 in the appendix. A couple
highlights. Our consumer Mobile Banking app now serves more than 47 million active users. They logged in 3.5
billion times this quarter. We also continue to see more sales through the use of our digital properties. Digital
sales represented 53% of our total sales in the past quarter in our consumer businesses. 23 million consumers
are now using Zelle. They sent money on Zelle at nearly two and a half times the rate they write checks and in
fact more Zelle transactions – sent transactions take place than combination of customer ATM transaction and
cash withdrawals at teller. Simply put, Zelle is becoming a dominant way to move money.
In our Wealth Management business, we're seeing more banking accounts being opened to complement the
investment business those clients with us. Importantly, these clients are also recognize the ease of our digital
banking capability. 75% of our new accounts in our Merrill teammates were open digitally. 87% of our Global
Banking clients are also digitally active. We've innovated and significantly streamlined service requests by
enabling clients directly initiate and track transaction inquiries within our awarded CashPro platform using AI to
accomplish that.
Third, we continue to make core strategic investments in our businesses. We are not complacent with the
success you see on this page. We continue to strategically invest in our core businesses. A few examples. While
we have the leading retail deposit share in America, we continue to invest in both 11 new financial centers this
quarter, in this first half of the year and renovate another 243, this investment in both our expansion markets and
our growth markets.
In Wealth Management, we continue to invest in our advisor development program. It's grown to 2,300
teammates, allowing us to continuously add more than – teammates to our 18,000 strong best-in-class financial
advisory force across all our Wealth Management businesses. We're also adding teams of experienced advisors
strategically in areas across the country. In our banking teams, we continue to add to our regional investment
banking team. We now have more than 200 regional bankers across the country to better serve our commercial
clients, and they complement our industry coverage to our corporate clients.
In our Global Markets business, we continue to extend balance sheet to our clients in adding expertise and talent
to continue to lead our market share improvement seen over the last several years. We also have increased our
technology initiative spend and expect to spend nearly $4 billion on technology initiatives this year. We have
focused projects around our artificial intelligence enhancements with both clients and our teammates. Our recent
example of our use of AI is our advisor and client insights tool. We delivered more than 6 million insights year-to-
date to our financial advisors providing them proactively engage with clients. AI has moved from cost savings
ideas to enhancing the quality of our customer interactions.
Fourth, our organic growth is driving integrated flows across our business. We invest heavily in each line of
business that compete in the markets based on their particular customer segment, but importantly, we also invest
across our lines of business to knit them together and gain market share in the local markets.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
It's a differentiated advantage for us, our banking leadership position across our businesses and our nationwide
franchise. For example, we leverage our franchise by connecting business customers, Wealth Management
teams. Our teams across all our businesses have made 4 million referrals to other businesses in the first six
months of this year.
Next, we drive efficiency and effectiveness and that's through our operational excellence platform. We continue to
invest heavily in the future of our franchise and growth while we also have to manage expenses day-to-day. Our
focus on operational excellence has enabled us to hold our expense growth up to 2% year-over-year, well below
the inflation rates, we continue to work to achieve operating leverage as NII stabilizes and begins to grow again.
As you look at it, and Alastair will explain later, a fair portion of the year-over-year increase in expense is due to
formulaic incentives of Wealth Management due to the fee growth in that business. And last our capital strength
allows us to deliver for all our stakeholders. Our capital remains strong as we held our CET1 ratio at 11.9% this
quarter. We grew loans, increased our share repurchases to $3.5 billion, and paid $1.9 billion in dividends.
Average diluted shares dropped below 8 billion shares outstanding. In addition, we also announced our intent to
increase our quarterly dividend 8% upon board approval. Note that 11.9% CET1 ratio remained a solid excess
capital position of both of other current regulatory requirements and the increased requirement to 10.7%
beginning in October as a result of recent CCAR exam.
Let's turn to slide 4. A couple things to note here. First, we've noted for several quarters that the second quarter
NII would be the trough for this rate cycle. We expect NII to grow in the third quarter and fourth quarter this year.
Alastair is going to provide you some points in detail about the path forward.
One of the important contributors to that change is the positive behaviors of our customers. On slide 4, you'll note
that average deposits grew 2% year-over-year and increased modestly linked quarter. The second quarter in
reality is typically a heavy outflow quarter. We have a lot of customers who pay a lot of taxes in that quarter.
Quarter-over-quarter increases in rates paid continue to slow again this quarter across all businesses except for
Wealth Management and we show you that on this page slide 4 by line of business. While wealth business
deposit rates moved higher with continued rotation, we expect those rates to begin to stabilize and the rate of
quarterly change decrease going forward.
Turning to slide 5, in previous calls, many of you've asked questions or commented upon the question about
consumer net charge-offs and when would they stabilize in the second half of 2024. That expectation, we have,
remains unchanged as well. This quarter's net charge-offs were 59 basis points. For context, this is stabilization of
the rate. I will just remind you that prior to this quarter, I have to go all the way back to 2014 to see a charge-off
rate of that high and that's near when we were still emerging from the financial crisis.
On slide 4, we highlight the 30 and 90 day plus credit card delinquency trends which show delinquencies have
plateaued for the second consecutive quarter. This should lead to stabilized net credit losses in credit card in the
second half of the year.
At the bottom of the page, note a couple of facts. First on a payment rates. This is the rate of pay down of
balances in a given month, remain 20% above index to the pre-pandemic levels even while our card customers
have plenty of capacity to borrow. And importantly, because of our relationship-based businesses, look at the
right hand slide of the bottom of page five. There you can see our deposit investment balances of our customers
who also have a card with us, remain 25% above their pre-pandemic levels, illustrating continue to help these
customers. So as you think about consumer credit, the card charge-offs drive it in a flattened out in terms of
delinquencies and we expect them to improve in the second half.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
With regard to commercial real estate, our usual CRE, credit exposure slide is included in our appendix. We
continue to aggressively work through our loans in our modest CRE office portfolio. We saw a decrease in all the
categories, decrease in reservable criticized loans, a decrease in NPLs and a decrease in net charge-offs. This
supports our previous expectation that net charge-offs in the second half of 2024 will be lower than the first half of
2024.
Our second quarter performance highlights Bank of America's ability to generate strong, sustainable growth
through a combination of customer centric strategies, innovation, strategic investments, and a commitment to
strong balance of risk and reward. We call that responsible growth. We're confident that focused approach will
continue to drive long-term success and create value for you, our shareholders.
Now I will turn it to Alastair for additional results.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Brian, and I'm going to start on slide 6 of the earnings presentation. I'll touch on more highlights noted
on slide 6 as we work through the material. I just wanted to say upfront that we delivered strong returns with
return on average assets of 85 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of nearly 14%.
So let's move to the balance sheet on slide 7, where you can see we ended the quarter at $3.26 trillion of total
assets, relatively unchanged from the first quarter and not much to note here apart from a mix shift of lower
securities balances, mostly offset by an increase in reverse repo and modest loan growth, as well as Global
Markets client activity.
On the funding side, deposits declined $36 billion on an ending basis, reflecting typical seasonal customer
payments of income taxes, and as Brian noted, average deposits were still modestly higher. Liquidity remains
strong with $909 billion of global liquidity sources. That was flat compared to the first quarter.
Shareholders' equity was also flat compared to Q1 as earnings were offset by $5.4 billion in capital distributed to
shareholders, and a $1.9 billion redemption of preferred stock in the quarter. The $5.4 billion of capital
contributions included $1.9 billion in common dividends, and the repurchase of $3.5 billion in shares.
AOCI improved modestly in the quarter, and tangible book value per share of $25.37, rose 9% from the second
quarter of last year. In terms of regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $198 billion and the CET1 ratio was
stable at 11.9%. This 11.9% ratio remained well above our current 10% requirement, as well as our new 10.7%
requirement as of October 1, 2024.
Risk-weighted assets increased modestly and that was driven by lending activity. Our supplemental leverage ratio
was 6% versus our minimum requirement of 5% and that leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth and
our $468 billion of TLAC means our total loss absorbing capital ratio remains comfortably above our
requirements.
Brian already covered deposit trends. So let's turn the balance sheet focus to loans and we'll look at average
balances on slide 8. You can see average loans in Q2 of $1.051 trillion. They improved 1% year-over-year, driven
by 5% credit card growth and modest commercial growth. The modest improvement in overall commercial loans
included a 2% increase in our domestic commercial loans and leases, partially offset by a 4% decline in

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
commercial real estate. Middle Market lending saw an uptick in the quarter, and we saw good demand in our
wealth businesses from customer lending.
These areas of growth were largely offset by continued pay-downs from our larger corporate clients on interest
rate sentiment. Consumer growth was driven by credit card borrowing and while home lending balances were
flattish, originations picked up a bit this quarter. Lastly, and on a positive note, loan spreads continued to widen.
As we turn our focus then to NII performance and slide 9, note that we move the slide we typically used to talk
about excess deposits to the appendix on slide 22, so you can see that there. Our excess deposit levels above
loans remained high at $850 billion and continued to be a good source of value for shareholders. 52% of our
excess liquidity is now in short-dated cash and available for sale securities.
The longer-dated lower yielding hold-to-maturity book continues to roll-off and we reinvested again this quarter in
higher yielding assets. The blended yield of cash and securities continue to improve in the quarter, and is now
160 basis points above our deposit rate paid.
Regarding NII, on a GAAP [Technical Difficulty] (00:18:20-00:19:45)

...will materialize and this now includes three interest rate cuts starting in September, another in November, and
one more in December, and the waterfall shows an estimated impact of those rate cuts to our quarterly NII. The
next couple of categories are a result of natural management interest rate risk in a balance sheet mix with fixed
rate assets and variable rate assets and our balance sheet is split roughly half in half.
So we take in liquidity from customers that we use to fund our assets and then we store excess liquidity in cash
and securities. We have fixed assets that mature and pay down and those supply cash that then gets put back to
work on the balance sheet and reprices over time and we have two basic categories of fixed assets that mature
and pay off and those are securities and loans.
On securities, you can see we've got about $10 billion a quarter of cash coming off of our securities portfolio and
again roughly 300 basis points of improvement on those assets when we put that money back from the balance
sheet.
On loans, between resi mortgage and auto, we've got another roughly $10 billion which reprices with a little less
yield improvement and little securities and between the securities and loans, we expect the fixed rate asset
repricing adds about $300 million to our quarterly rate of NII as we get to the fourth quarter.
On the variable rate asset side and to protect from down moves in rates, we hedged some of that with cash flow
swaps and those typically roll-off in any given quarter and get replaced over time. So, included in the cash flow
hedges is an impact of cessation of BSBY as an alternative rate. If you recall, we took a charge in the fourth
quarter of 2023, it was $1.6 billion and we said that would come back to us through time. And beginning in
November, we start to see the benefit coming back into NII and in Q4, that's about $200 million.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
That Q4 partial quarter benefit will grow by slightly smaller sequential NII benefit in Q1 2025 and then it begins to
taper off heading into 2026.
In addition, we've got about $150 billion of receive fixed cash flow hedges protecting us from short rate moves
moving over. Most are hedging floating rate commercial loans and the cost of those hedges is reported as contra
revenue in commercial loan interest income. These hedges have a weighted-average life of just over two years
and they've got an average fixed rate of approximately 250 basis points.
So, starting in the second half of 2025, we begin to get some additional NII tailwind because the cash flow hedges
with lower fixed rate likes where we receive, those will begin to roll-off and will likely replace those at higher
current market rates at the time. The actual size of the tailwind will get from the expiration of those swaps will
obviously be highly dependent on the level and the shape of the yield curve at the time of those maturities and
that stretches out over the course of the next four years.
Okay. A couple other points to make. You'll note we don't expect much movement around our modestly liability
sensitive Global Markets NII activity and lastly, our forward view has an expectation of low single-digit growth in
loans, low single-digit growth in deposits, with continued slowing of rate paid movement through the back half of
2024, and you can see our expectation of the combined impact here as well.
This last element is the one that has the most potential variability and obviously, it will depend upon actual deposit
and loan growth and pricing and rotation. Okay. Let's turn to expense and we'll use slide 11 for the discussion.
We reported $16.3 billion of expense this quarter and that's more than $900 million lower than Q1 which included
$700 million for the FDIC special assessment. Not including the FDIC assessment, expenses were lower than Q1
by $229 million, driven by seasonally lower payroll tax expense.
Compared to Q2 2023, we're up less than 2% and that increase is equal to the incentives paid for improved fee
revenue. Incentives for GWIM business alone are up $200 million year-over-year and that's obviously an expense
we're happy to pay when we have a 14% improvement in fees for assets under management.
Our second quarter head count number included welcoming a diverse class of nearly 2,000 summer interns, we
hope will join us over the course of the next year or two upon their graduation and absent those interns, our head
count fell by nearly 2,000. In the third quarter, we expect to add approximately 2,500 college graduates for full
time, more than – and that's from more than 120,000 applications received showing that we remain an employer
of choice for talented young people.
Expense levels for the rest of 2024 are expected to bounce around the second quarter level given the higher fee
revenue and investments made for growth. So let's now move to credit and we'll turn to slide 12. There was little
change in our asset quality metrics this quarter. Provision expense was $1.5 billion. That was $189 million higher
than Q1 driven by a smaller reserve for lease in Q2. Net charge-offs of $1.5 billion were little changed with a small
increase in credit card, mostly offset by lower commercial real estate office charge-offs. On a weighted basis, we
remain reserved for unemployment rate of nearly 5% by the end of 2025 compared to the most recent 4.1% rate
reported. The net charge-off ratio was 59 basis points largely unchanged from Q1.
On slide 13, we highlight more credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Consumer
net charge-offs increased by a modest $31 million versus the first quarter, from the flow through of higher late
stage credit card delinquencies from Q1. Highlighting the change in direction of delinquencies, consumer 90 day
plus delinquencies declined in 2Q by $57 million.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
Commercial net charge-offs were relatively flat as lower commercial real estate losses were mostly offset by a
small increase in other commercial loans. Our office losses went from $304 million in Q1 to $226 million in Q2.
Other commercial real estate loan losses were simply one [indiscernible] (00:27:12)
Okay. Let's move to the various lines of business and some brief comments on their results and I'll start on slide
14 with Consumer Banking. For the quarter, consumer earned $2.6 billion on continued strong organic growth and
reported earnings declined 9% year-over-year as revenue declined from lower deposit balances compared to the
second quarter of last year.
Customer activity showed another strong quarter. Net new checking growth, another strong period of card
openings, and investment balances for consumer clients which climbed 23% year-over-year through a new record
$476 billion. That included 12 months of strong flows at $38 billion in addition to market appreciation over the
time.
As noted earlier, loans grew nicely year-over-year from credit card as well as small business where we remain the
industry leader. The team held expense flat year-over-year, reflecting good work with continued business
investments for growth offset by the operational excellence work to improve processes and move more of our
transactions to digital, and as you can see on the appendix page 26, digital adoption and engagement continued
to improve, and customer satisfaction scores remain near record levels, illustrating customer appreciation of our
enhanced capabilities due to our continuous investment.
Moving to Wealth Management on slide 15, we produced good results and those included good organic client
activity, market favorability, and strong AUM flows, and this quarter also saw good lending results. Our
comprehensive suite of investment and advisory services coupled with our commitment to personalized Wealth
Management planning and solutions has enabled us to meet the diverse needs and aspirations of our clients. Net
income rose 5% from the second quarter of last year to a little more than $1 billion.
In Q2, we reported revenue of $5.6 billion growing 6% over the prior year. As Brian noted, strong 14% growth in
fee revenue from investment and brokerage services overcame the NII headwind. Expense growth reflects the fee
growth and other investments for future. The business had a 25% margin and it generated a stronger turn on
capital of more than 22%. Average loans were up 2% year-over-year driven by strong growth we're seeing in
custom lending and a pick-up in mortgage lending.
Both Merrill and the Private Bank continued to see good organic growth and they produced strong assets under
management flows of $57 billion since last year's second quarter which reflects a mix of new client money as well
as existing clients putting more of their money to work. I also want to highlight the continued digital momentum in
this business and you can find that on slide 28.
On slide 16, we turn to Global Banking results and here, the business produced earnings of $2.1 billion, down
20% year-over-year, as improved investment banking fees and treasury services revenue were overcome by
lower net interest income and higher provision expense. Revenue declined 6% driven by the impact of interest
rates and deposit rotation.
A diversified revenue across products and regions reflects the strength of our Global Banking franchise. In our
GTS business, fees for managing the cash of clients offsets a lot of the NII pressure from higher rates and clients
are accessing the capital markets for their capital needs instead of borrowing. Investment banking had a strong
quarter, growing fees 29% year-over-year to nearly $1.6 billion, led by debt capital markets fees, mostly in

leverage finance and investment grade and we finished the quarter strong maintaining our number three
investment banking fee position globally.
A solid start to 2024 has left us in a good position with top three rankings now in North America, Latin America,
and EMEA and number six in APAC and we're seeing strong performance in important industry groups as well.
An increase in provision expense from last year was driven by the commercial real estate net charge-offs I
discussed earlier and expense increased 3% year-over-year including continued investment in the business.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 17, I'll focus my comments on results excluding DVA as I normally do. The
team had another terrific quarter as we generated good revenue growth and achieved operating leverage and
continued to deliver a solid return on capital. Earnings of $1.4 billion, grew 19% year-over-year and return on
average allocated capital was 13%. Revenue and again this is ex-DVA, improved 10% from the second quarter of
2023.
Focusing on sales and trading, ex-DVA, revenue improved 7% year-over-year to $4.7 billion and that's the highest
second quarter in over a decade. FICC was down 1% while equities increased 20% compared to Q2 2023. FICC
revenues remain strong and versus Q2 2023, they were modestly lower driven by a weaker macro trading quarter
in FX and rates, and that was largely offset by better commodities and mortgage trading.
Equities was driven by strong trading results in derivatives and cash equities. Year-over-year expenses were up
4% on revenue improvement and continued investment in the business. Finally, on slide 18, All Other shows a
loss of $0.3 billion and that was little changed year-over-year as lower expense was offset by lower provision
costs as a result of reserve changes.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 9% and excluding discrete items and the tax credits related to
investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, the effective tax rate would have been 25%.
And with that, I think we'll stop there and we'll jump into questions.

Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Bank of America Corp.
All right. Alastair, Brian, I just wanted to – I did hear some feedback that maybe the audio from the call got
interrupted for a moment, so at the point of which it got interrupted, I just want to reiterate a couple of points that
Alastair was making.
If you go back to slide 9, where I think we lost the audio was where we started beginning discussion about the
performance from Q1 to Q2 of net interest income. That was driven by higher funding cost and the rotation of
deposits seeking higher yield alternatives, and while higher again in Q2 both the rotation and the rate pay
increases did continue to slow down.
On the slide 10, I think the only points that I would make that Alastair began to discuss there was, we are just
reiterating our expectation that quarter two would be the bottom for the NII in the rate cycle that we have been in,
and our trajectory remains the same. The belief that our NII will begin to rise in Q3 compared to Q2 and then rise
again in Q4.
We provided the range of expectations that Alastair covered and we expect Q4 NII to be around the $14.5 billion
level plus or minus. That would be approximately 4% to 5% higher than this quarter's NII and he began that
10

discussion by making sure that you know that we pick-up an extra day of net interest income in the Q3 providing
about $125 million of additional NII that also carries through into Q4. You see that on the slide.
It also assumes that the current forward curve will materialize. That said that interest rate cuts will start in
September. We will expect another one in November and December in the curve and the waterfall includes an
estimated impact of those rates to quarterly net interest income.
And so then we started a discussion, he began the discussion on the fixed asset repricing, which then I think is
where the audio picked back up again and so we're happy to answer some questions on that. I know you'll have
questions, but just wanted to recover those points for you.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi, thanks very much. Hello there. And definitely appreciate slide 10 a lot. I know you would have given us a 2025
NII guide if you wanted to give us one, so feel free to give that if you want, but that's not my question. My question
is given all the pieces of the puzzle that you gave us, expectations for modest loan to deposit growth and slowing
deposit seeking behavior, if you get that 4% pick-up from 2Q to 4Q this year that you're expecting, right now, or at
least recently consensus had NII looking flattish with that fourth quarter number and that doesn't make a lot of
sense given all the pieces. So maybe if you can just comment directionally, if you don't want to give the number of
– does it make sense to you that we collectively be expecting flat NII with your higher fourth quarter number?

Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So Glenn, you're right. We're probably not going to give guidance around 2025 for all the reasons that you would
expect. What we're trying to do here is reinforce for everyone what we've been saying from the beginning of the
year and as we think Q2 is the trough and we believe from this point we're in a good position to grow.
Now when you look at some of the elements of this bridge, you'll draw your own conclusions with respect to fixed
rate asset pricing is going to persist for some period of time and you'll be able to draw your own conclusions. But I
just want to point out, we've been pretty clear on our guidance for Q1 and Q2. We've always felt like this would be
the trough. We feel like Q3 and Q4 are likely to be better. You can see our work here. We've laid it all out.
Nothings really changed in terms of that and the most important thing I think for everybody here is we feel like
2024 is a really foundational year. It's this twist period where we just got to get through the last of the deposit
rotation and we're establishing a foundation for growth from here, so that's what we're trying to convey.

Maybe I could just ask a follow-up on deposits, within the wealth business. You have $4 trillion of client assets. I'm
curious if you can break out the split between brokerage and advisory accounts. Can you hear me okay? I'm
hearing tons of feedback...

Great. $4 trillion in client assets in wealth. I'm curious if you can give us the split between brokerage and advisory
and the reason I'm asking is I'm curious how you've been handling rate paid on cash and advisory accounts and
whether we should expect any behavioral changes following the recent wealth news. Thanks a lot. Sorry for the
feedback.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Look, Glenn, I'm not sure that distinction would be the distinction I'd look to. We've gone through a massive
change in cash infused in the economy and we're drawing out under monetary policy and so as we stabilize our
instructions to our team are to grow our deposit base a little bit faster than economy and that means you have to
price across the board to achieve that.
And if you look at the slide 4 or 5 where I showed you sort of the change, what you see is the Wealth
Management business takes a little bit longer because those clients have more investment cash with us. Not what
you're thinking investment cash is in their money how they think about cash, they don't need for daily cash flow,
then they move that around, that largely is over, and if you look in the last four to six weeks we're seeing those
deposits of that business bounce around to $280-odd-billion level, not a lot of movement and it'll keep moving in
and out depending on customers paying down, paying their income taxes, taking more risk in the market and all
those things, but the deposit pricing changes that we made to ensure that they had a platform they could grow,
having been as high as $350 billion down to $280 billion, were made in the quarter and all through the P&L.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell of Seaport Global.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up and I don't mean to beat a dead horse on NII. But can you just
help us think through the puts and takes on – you have rate cuts at the end of the year, forward curve implies
more next year. Is that cumulative impact starts to hit next year, I guess what gives you confidence that this is sort
of a trough. What are all of the puts and takes that we should think about and how we model the NII for next year
when we think about the forward curve and that impact?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Jim, I think this bridge probably is all the right inputs for any given year. I mean, we've chosen to do it for 2024.
We've always resisted going out too far for the very simple reason that so many variables and they start to
multiply with one another.
If you think about even the rate cut one here, we're using the three cuts September, November, December, if I do
this as of Wednesday of last week, there would have been two. Earlier in the year there were six, so since we
don't know what that path looks like, it's very challenging then to provide guidance for 2025 at this stage.
But what we're laying out here is these are the component parts. We're going to get some benefit from fixed rate
asset pricing over time. We're going to get some benefit from the immediate term from the BSBY cessation and
that's leading back into the P&L. As that rolls off, we'll get benefit from cash flow hedges repricing and then we
use the forward curve the same as you do for the rate cuts. We benefit a little bit from Global Markets liability
sensitivity.
And then that final piece is the piece that we're trying to drive in terms of organic growth. We're trying to drive this
loan growth, trying to drive the deposit growth. And as Brian pointed out, it's been a pretty unusual period in
history where we've had an enormous change in the rate structure and in the fiscal stimulus and the effects now
fading away to something more normal, but that last box will come down to your assumptions versus our
assumptions, and we will update you as we go through the next couple quarters and we'll give you a better sense
towards the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. That's all fair. And maybe just on the growth piece, maybe deposits. Seem to have bottomed for you guys
in the second quarter of last year. You've had new growth, I think Brian pointed out, even with the tax headwind
this quarter, you grew sequentially. So good performance, but still pretty modest. How are you thinking about the
growth trajectory from here, I guess, as we think about is it – does it accelerate with rate cuts in your view. What
are the dynamics you're thinking about that's really returning to the historical kind of mid-single-digit deposit
growth within BofA and the industry?

Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I think Brian covered slide 4, that top left chart gives a sense for what's going on with the growth, that's
average growth over time there. We've had four quarters in a row, so feel good about that part.
Q2 does tend to be a slower quarter just with all the tax payments, so we think deposits will do better over time
particularly as we get past peak Fed funds. We feel like the pricing and rotation, you can sort of see it in our
numbers, they're slowing, so we're getting towards the end there. We're getting towards the end of Q3, so we're
not quite finished on all of those things yet. I'd be careful about getting too excited about deposit growth, but we
feel like we're doing okay so far and we just got to keep driving that.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I'll start with a simple question. You mentioned loan spreads have improved. Why is that? Where is that? Do
you expect that to continue?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Loan spreads have improved for us, Mike, over the course of the past, I think it's now eight or nine quarters. It's
primarily in the commercial businesses, and it's largely because we have to price the balance sheet for the returns
that our shareholders expect, and that's true, I think, for the industry. We've been quite purposeful in that regard,
so we've tried to balance price spread and growth over the course of time, but it's primarily in commercial
phenomenon at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
And I would expect that to continue for the foreseeable future but it's a competitive environment. We've got to see.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. You gave us slide 10, a lot of details there. You talked about the September rate cuts, the fixed asset
repricing, securities repricing, loans repricing, mortgage and auto, swaps maturing, November, we see fixed cash
swaps, a whole litany of stuff. But I think when you put it all together, what it's led to is a net internet margin of
only 1.93%. In fact, I think your yield on your assets is below Fed funds right now, so would you agree that you're
under earning with that NIM of 1.93% and I know I've asked this question before, but you always have to mark-to-
14


Bank of America Corp.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
market, what is a normal NIM, I mean you were 2.5% in 2017, you were 3% in 2004 and I know the composition
changed and everything. But what's normal NIM and what do you think is a normal return on common equity
through the cycle? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So I'd say right now, in terms of the 1.93%, we feel like we are under earning. We feel like that number's going to
go up over time. It'll go up as net interest income goes up, but additionally, I think the balance sheet is likely to
stay kind of flattish here, so the numerator is going to grow, the denominator is going to stay pretty tight here, so
we think we're under earning there.
We think through a cycle, we've got to get back to more normal number like 2.30-ish over time. That takes a
while. It's a grind, Mike, quarter-after-quarter, so that's where we're headed. And in terms of return on allocated
capital, right now, we're right around that 14%. We want to be 15% and higher for our shareholder. A lot of it is
because we've accrued an awful lot of capital over the course of time, in advance of any potential capital
changes.
And the other final thing I'd just remind you is, we're a little different than some of the regional banks in that we've
got an enormous Global Markets business and that obviously makes an impact on the headline NIM number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just I wasn't clear. You said net charge-offs in the second half should be less than the first half
and I wasn't sure if that related to cards or I wasn't sure what [indiscernible] (00:48:42) charge-offs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, Mike, that was me, and basically, what I'm saying is you plateaued in terms of the delinquencies which
means the second half is pretty well determined as you know because it's just a march from 36 days, 90 days to
180 days and it will be – the charge-offs rate will be flattish, we kind of back to normal at 3.80% or so. We
underwrite to actually have a higher charge-off rate quite frankly in that intolerance but that 3.80% is kind of where
we see it since 3.80%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. So credit card charge-offs should flatten or decline in the second half relative to the first half?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Exactly. Remember, if you think about all the charge-offs that's the dominant part of it on the consumer side by a
lot and then the commercial, we spoke to the question of CRE office which has been dropped quarter-to-quarter
and we expect the second half to be better also.

Good morning, Steve.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
How are you guys? So wanted to ask just on – just building on some of the NIM questions from earlier. A lot of it's
been focused on asset repricing, both loans and securities, and was hoping you could speak to the opportunity to
potentially optimize some of your higher cost funding and just given multiple sources of NIM improvement, looking
beyond 2024, how should we think about the pace of NIM build as we – I know it's a longer timeline to get to the
2.30% to 2.40%, but just how to think about the expectations around the NIM trajectory beyond 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, your first point is a question of can we pay down some of the higher cost securities. The answer to that is
yes, and that would be an expectation of ours as part of this. We've got some shorter-dated CDs that can roll-off.
We can replace those or not. We have shorter dated debt. We've taken our long-term debt footprint down as
we've continued to build the strength of the company, so there's a lot of different ways. It doesn't have to be
securities reinvestment. It can be paying down higher cost liabilities as well, so we've got a lot of different ways
that we can use "the reinvestment" if you like around fixed rate.
And then what was the second – your second question was over...
[indiscernible] (00:51:18)

Yeah, for sure, but I'm just wondering is there anything that's like, I guess what I just would like to understand a

switch on in 3Q? Just understanding how the swap book is playing into this thing.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, so the part that's important for slide 10 around the second half of this year is just the BSBY piece.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
It's not from cash flow swaps. Any cash flow swaps we have the roll-off in the course of the next 12 months really,
they're all kind of current coupon-ish because anything that we did there was to do with LIBOR cessation or
whatever, so they all got re-couponed, so I wouldn't worry about that.
In the second half and onwards, some of the older longer-dated things, they've got the lower coupons, so that's
when the BSBY number over time will disappear, but in the second half of 2025, the cash flow number will begin
to appear and we'll give you a sense for what that looks like over time, Betsy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Got it. And then on the far right hand side of slide 10, you've got the yellow box, $50 million to $200 million.
Could you just give us a sense as to what's the inputs to the $50 million versus the $200 million, just so we can be
able to track it as we go through the rest of the next few quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, we're essentially using four variables. We're thinking what will the loan growth be? What will the deposit
growth look like? What will be the rotation between non-interest bearing and interest bearing, and what will be any
pricing changes we need to make, right. Then the rotation and pricing are pretty closely interlinked, if you could
even call them the same thing.
If you use more conservative numbers you get towards the lower end, if you use slightly more constructive
numbers you get towards the higher. I think the point we're trying to convey is this last part, this yellow box is
always the unknowable at the beginning of the quarter, where we're projecting. The pieces in the green, we kind
of feel like we know what those look like. That's pretty predictable at this point that we've got a little more certainty
around that. So the teams – we got 213,000 people who are working really hard to try and make that dotted
yellow box the higher end, but obviously, it depends on our assumptions and it depends on our actuals.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Just my first question is trying to square what you're telling us on the net interest income
trajectory and the setup versus your disclosure. So Alastair, you told us about as a response to Glenn's question
the benefit from fixed asset repricing, cash flow hedges repricing in the second half of 2025, and when I look at
table 40 from your Q, in both a parallel shift and a steepener scenario down 100 bps is negative to net interest
income. Is it because this is a 12-month look and like you pointed out in the second half of 2025, you have under
water cash flow hedges that are rolling off. In other words, as we go through 2025, do you get less asset sensitive
and additionally, what is the notional on those cash flow hedges that you're talking about?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, so the asset sensitivity that we disclose is meant to give a sense for what happens if nothing changes. It's
totally static, so that's one difference. Number two, it's off of the future curve, so it's 100 bps above whatever or
below whatever the future curve is, so I think it's a really helpful thing for sort of short-term moves in rates, like
take for example, that orange box on page 10. It's helpful for something like that, but it's less helpful in terms of a
predictor of where 2025 NII would be because there's so many other inputs, Erika, over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And just what's the notional of the cash flow hedges that you're referring to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Over time? Let's say about $150 billion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And how much of that starts rolling off in the second half of 2025?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well I think about it like this. You can almost think about it like it's $10 billion or so every quarter. It's just that the
ones that roll-off for the next 12 months, they're all kind of current coupons, so they won't really have any impact
once you get into the second half of 2025 they're a little bit lower rated, so that's when you begin to get benefit
there and then I think probably Lee can give you more of the details following.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. If I could just slide in one more question on the normalized NIM. 2.3% and 2.4% clearly is much higher than
where you are now. Alastair, you mentioned we should assume a flattish balance sheet, but I think our
conversations with the company before in that half of that path between 1.9-ish to 2.3% to 2.4% has to do with
balance sheet efficiency, and I'm wondering if you could carry out the balance sheet efficiency and keep your
balance sheet flattish. In other words, obviously what the market is going to do is take your earning assets today
and apply two, three, five, and say okay, over time whether it's 2026 or 2027, this is what BofA can earn under a
19


Bank of America Corp.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
normalized curve. I'm wondering if that's the right math to do or should we expect some shrinkage of the balance
sheet if you can – that's part of the path for.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, I think what will happen is the underlying growth of the company will still be there, but we have some things
that we know, just like Steve asked that question, is there any higher rate shorter-dated stuff you'd like to pay off?
Yes. There will be overtime. So I think we've got some ability to almost like self-fund the first $100 billion, $150
billion of growth in terms of earning assets so that's where we're seeing that'll keep the denominator down while
we're growing the numerator.

Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Alastair, I just wanted to ask you a little bit more on the securities portfolio side,
because you also have what $180 billion or so of pay fixed swaps on the AFS book, and so we know about the
[ph] HFS, HGM (00:59:08) maturity schedule, but how do you look at that AFS book and how much are those pay
fixed swaps currently in the money and kind of like how you're just thinking about that side of the portfolio as well.

...that there – remember, that is when we put the AFS in our portfolio it's so that we've got a group of securities
that are sitting there. They're typically treasuries. We swap them to floating, so that they look like they're cash as
far as we're concerned. We don't have to worry about in fact, then to regulatory capital flowing through, and they
just – to us they just look like cash equivalents so that's how we think about it, Ken.

Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I mean it's less of an interest rate call for us. It's more of going back to this concept of we've got $1.9 trillion
of deposits and we've got $1.05 trillion of loans, so we've got $850 billion of excess. So when the excess comes
in, we can do a variety of different things. We'd love to put it in loans, but that's always our first love, but in the
absence of that, we're going to put it in cash, or we're going to put it in available for sale, probably swap-to-
floating for the most part, and we can choose to put things in hold to maturity if we choose to.
But obviously, right now, we feel like we want hold to maturity just continuing to pay down, that's what's been
happening over the course of the past 11 quarters, we're just going to keep going with that. So no particular
changes to our philosophy around available for sale.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And a quick one on expenses. I believe you said that costs are kind of hanging here at around the $16.3
billion that was reported. And so just kind of any color on puts and takes here. Or just is that better kind of
revenue-related comp against your ongoing efficiencies and just how do you think about longer term expense
growth again. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Sure, Ken. I think honestly the second quarter is sort of emblematic if you think about last year's second quarter
and this year's second quarter, we went up by $300 million as Alastair said, $200 million was just Wealth
Management incentive comp and the other growth was really other incentive comp.
So the idea, the pressures we face now are really more due to fee growth in the businesses which typically have
a tighter correlation between fees and expenses and incentive comp related to those fees. So that – as Alastair
said, that's a good expense growth is what you want. It does grow and it grows at a good rate.
Headcount has basically been bounced around relatively flat, we're at 212 this quarter, even adding a bunch of
summer teammates, we were at 215 last year this quarter the same summer teammates included. So managing
head count, redeploying people. We have the clean-up stock going on. We have the new initiatives going on.
We're freeing up work and moving it. So we feel good about managing the company and that's against inflation
rate and wages that are 3%, 5% going on inflation and all the services we buy in the third party markets obviously,
that the world experiences, so we feel good about how we're managing expenses. The key is pretty simple. As
you follow the revenue side the equation, Alastair has been talking about your colleagues on NII stuff, is that lifts
and expenses stay relatively flat, you start moving towards positive operating leverage.
We're minus 1% or something like that this quarter kind of hanging in there and we'll expect that to go back to the
five-year track we had all the way up until the pandemic hit and things got thrown [indiscernible] (01:03:02).

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi, Brian. Hi, Alastair.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Morning, Gerard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Hi there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Brian, you talked and Alastair both of you talked about the excess deposits. I think it was slide 22 you pointed to.
Can you share with us as you go forward and assuming the Federal Reserve does cut into rates, I know you put I
think three Fed fund rate cuts in your slide 10, but as we go out into the end of 2025, the forward curve is calling
for obviously more rate cuts. Could you tell us how you expect to price your deposits as rates continue to follow
with this excess deposit level, can you be more aggressive in lowering your deposit costs?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, I think that's very business and more importantly, customer-specific views, Gerard, so we think our deposit
strategies in the context of how our customers utilize our services and so if you think about the parts that priced
up in Global Banking or the investment-related cash in the consumer business and Wealth Management, that'll
come back down as rates come because the short-term equivalents come down. Some is actually mechanical
because it's actually priced to meet money-market fund equivalent. That'll happen, and so yes, I think if you think
about it being all-in, if you look on that slide, 203 basis points, there will be some pick-up as rates come down in
those higher things.
The zero interest balance accounts are low interest checking, they don't really move because there's zero interest
or low interest, so they will be kind of static, but they are still extremely valuable in the current context. So when
you think of all the consumer, I think 60 odd basis points or something, that's driven by the fact that we have 40-
odd million transactional, primary checking accounts that is growing at 1 million a year, multiple years in a row,
900,000, 1 million a year that are maturing from $3,000 up to $7,000 or $8,000 in balances as people mature their
relationship with us. That's where the tremendous value in the deposit base of this company goes.
And so if you think about $1.91 trillion having grown $100 billion, almost from the trough, you think about it
growing linked quarter, multiple quarters in a row, you think about even as we look now by deposit balances
above that amount, those are good dynamics. So we think about it, but it'll move – but if you remember, part of
our deposit pricing is never going to move because it's zero.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Right, right. No doubt when those are the golden deposits. And one other question on slide 10, and also I think if I
recall your first quarter Q, you guys indicated you were asset-sensitive. I would assume that this slide 10 also
22


Bank of America Corp.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
shows that with the three rate cuts. Alastair, what would it take to move to a more neutral position on the balance
sheet or even a liability-sensitive position should the Fed really get into a rate cutting environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, so this shows that we're asset-sensitive. That's why the red box obviously is bigger than the green box. It's
the mortgage piece that's liability sensitive so we're still asset sensitive, Gerard. What it would take for us is either
we can have a lot more rotation into interest bearing or we combine some short-dated duration, fixed rate, so
those are the two alternatives. And if you look at the course of time – if you were to go back to our Qs over time,
you'd see that we had become less and less rate sensitive over time. We've really narrowed the corridor of where
the rates go up by 100 bps or down by 100 bps what could that income look like, narrowed that pretty
substantially over time, because we're trying to lock in rates here, recognizing NII is up $4 billion or $5 billion over
the course of the past several years per quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. The last thing I'd say Gerard, for a person who's been around this business as many years as you have.
This has been a very abnormal rate environment for the last 15 years or so, and if you get to where you have a
Fed funds rate 3.5% which is what our experts predict it sort of stops out at. The ability to bring the asset
sensitivity tighter and tighter is there because you actually have room to move down without hitting zero floors and
stuff, so stability – time periods of which the rate environment doesn't flip around and then secondly, a higher
nominal rate environment will allow you to manage to that outcome because part of the other outcome for us is
just as the rate structure is nominally very low is the zero floors kick in, and that creates an amount of sensitivity
that over time will go away if rate structure is higher, if that make sense to you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, no, it does. Thank you. And just Brian or Alastair, one last quick question. I noticed on slide 25, home
equity loan balance has actually increased. I think that's the first time in maybe over two or three years. Was there
a new program, or what are you seeing that drives that and should that or can that continue as we go forward into
2025? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, I think it just reflects that the people have locked in low rate loans and now they want to borrow, it's
inexpensive view because they've got a fixed rate mortgage loan and they've got home equity sitting on top of –
why wouldn't they use it. I'd like if it was only two years. It's been four or five years since that balance went from
$30 billion and started declining, so it's good to see. I'll note at bottom of that page, if you look at year-over-year
mortgage production, $5.7 billion to $5.9 billion and you look at home equity line production which is new
originations in the boxes, solid, but it is nice to finally see that the actual balances have stabilized and we'll see.
They are kind of flattish. They are not really growing but it's nice to see them not just keep coming down and
hopefully they'll start to be utilized. Our expectation would be they will be as consumers over time want to take out
part of the equity in their home at a rate that is reasonable, but doesn't require to refinance the whole first.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, thanks for the questions. Just a little color on non-interest bearing deposits. When you look at on an average
basis, the decline has clearly slowed sharply. Period end was down at a faster rate. Is that just the noise around
end of 1Q or what are you seeing as you look sort of month by month? Is that truly slowing and talk to it a little bit
by customer segment if you can, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, I think, Vivek, you're catching two things. First one is it is slowing, that rotation is slowing and we would
expect that because at the end of the day, this is mostly cash in motion. It's transactional accounts. That's why it's
non-interest bearing.
And the answer why it's a little different this quarter is because of the seasonality of tax payments. For anyone
who has a big tax payment due, they frequently just allow it, they may pull it out of their brokerage account, put it
into their non-interest bearing, and then they are wiring it out from there, so that's again an example of money in
motion, but that's what's going on this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
A quick one, Visa B derivative gains, did you have anything in your equity derivatives trading revenues this
quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Nothing to highlight. Nothing to note. That's a position we sold years ago and anything has happened with Visa
we just unwind on the balance sheet. We've recycled it, so it shouldn't have any impact to revenue.

Good morning, Matt.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. How are you guys thinking about kind of targeted capital levels going forward? Obviously, we're
still waiting for final rules. Maybe there's little more volatility in your SCB than you would have thought, but you still
24

got a nice buffer. And then I guess one last piece I was thinking is the remixing of the balance sheet that's been
commented kind of throughout this call over time, probably causes a little creep in RWAs, right, like loans higher
than say securities, so lots of excess capital but some puts and takes, and how are you thinking about it between
now and when we get final guidelines?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So first off, I think we always want to use the capital to grow the business so if we need to use it to support RWA
growth for loans or something, that's a good outcome and that's what we want to do first. Second, we maintain the
11.9% quarter-to-quarter with a little bit RWA increase. I think that would be sort of emblematic and we bought
$3.5 billion, paid out $1.9 billion in dividends so you expect that to kind of continue on in terms of that basic idea
of we don't need a lot of capital to grow because the RWA demands are met with a fairly straightforward amount.
We're earning a nice amount of dollars and we'll deploy it back in the dividend and the buybacks.
Our job is to – our view is will maintain a 50 basis point type of management buffer to whatever the requirements
are. The volatility, there's a whole different discussion on that in terms of the wisdom of that, but the reality is the
volatility is absorbable because you have time to play into it and get done within the race we've seen so whether
we agree with the volatility or not, we immediately absorb it and the new rules coming out we'll see what happens
and we'll adjust.
But just because basically a requirement of 10.7% under the new SCB, plus 50 bps is 11.2% maybe get a little
tighter if you feel you've got great insight to what happens next year, but and then I think the finalization of Basel
III will come through and we'll see what that is and see how that all correlates to the various aspects. But we feel
good about where we are and expect all current earnings are basically available to support the growth we're
talking about in the current economic environment that's relatively modest need, but really, the rest of it just goes
plowing back to you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then just to summarize that, I mean do you think about bringing down the 11.9% to 11.2% kind of in
the near-term, or just make it obvious like, that's a little bit more theoretical and wait for the capital rules to play
out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think we just need to see the next 60, 190, 120 days play out. We heared a lot of discussion about the timing of
the re-proposal or not et cetera, so we have a lot of flexibility but we continue to focus on shareholder value
creation and all of that, but I think we're in a critical spot for the industry in terms of learning the outcome of a lot of
these things over the next short period of time here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
Brian T. Moynihan
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, operator. Thank all of you for joining us today. Obviously, a lot of focus on NII and we gave you the
slide 10 to give you the bridge. Alastair answered a lot of the questions. Lee is here to answer. The key is to
understand what's driving that, which is deposit performance which is stabilized and starting to grow for like six
quarters in a row now. Loan growth very low, and look, very low but just staying positive. Those are going to drive
the value of this franchise and that's going to vary growth by our customers.
That's coupled with strong fee performance this quarter in terms of Wealth Management fees, investment banking
fees, consumer fees even growing global payment services fees and of course the great work done by our
markets team. So that level of flattish expenses gives us a chance to start driving operating leverage again in the
company and that generates a lot of earnings, a lot of excess capital and we put that back in your hands.
So thank you for your time and attention. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.

Operator: This does conclude today's Bank of America Earnings Announcement. You may now disconnect your
