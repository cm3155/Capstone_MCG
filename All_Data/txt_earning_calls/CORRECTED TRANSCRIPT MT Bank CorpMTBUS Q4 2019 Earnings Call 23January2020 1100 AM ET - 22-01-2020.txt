Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Now, I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As noted in this morning's release, M&T's results for the fourth
quarter closed out a year of solid performance, which included: 8% growth in earnings per common share; 11%
growth in noninterest revenues, with mortgage banking and trust fees leading the improvement; a stable year-
over-year net interest margin, notwithstanding the interest rate volatility we experienced in 2019; a credit
environment that remains favorable, which, although nonaccrual loans increased slightly, reflected the sixth
consecutive year of credit losses below 20 basis points; and industry-leading returns on shareholder capital, with
return on equity for the year improve slightly to 12.87% and return on tangible common equity exceeding 19% for
the second consecutive year.
We'll review the numbers for the full year in a moment, but first, let's turn our attention to the results for the fourth
quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $3.60 for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with
$3.47 per share in the third quarter of 2019 and $3.76 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Net income for the
quarter was $493 million compared with $480 million in the linked quarter and $546 million in the year ago
quarter.
On a GAAP basis, M&T's fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.6%
and an annualized return on average common equity of 12.95%. This compares with rates of 1.58% and 12.73%,
respectively, in the previous quarter.
Included in GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets
amounting to $3 million or $0.02 per common share, down slightly from $4 million and $0.3 per common share in
the prior quarter.
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or
tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as
well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur.
M&T's net operating income for the fourth quarter, which excludes intangible amortization, was $496 million
compared with $484 million in the linked quarter and $550 million in 2018's fourth quarter. Diluted net operating
earnings per common share were $3.62 for the recent quarter compared with $3.50 in 2019's third quarter and
$3.79 in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible
common shareholders' equity of 1.67% and 19.08% in the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.66%
and 18.85% in the third quarter of 2019.
In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP
and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
As a reminder, both GAAP and net operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2018 were impacted by certain
noteworthy items. Included in the fourth quarter 2018 results was a $20 million contribution to The M&T Charitable
Foundation. That amounted to $15 million after-tax effect or $0.11 per common share.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Also included in 2018's fourth quarter was a $15 million reduction in M&T's provision for income taxes arising from
an IRS-approved change in the tax treatment of certain loan fees which was retroactive to 2017. This also
amounted to $0.11 per common share.
Turning to the balance sheet and income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.01 billion in
the fourth quarter of 2019, down $21 million from $1.04 billion in the linked quarter. The net interest margin
declined to 3.64%, down 14 basis points from 3.78% in the linked quarter.
A higher average balance of funds placed on deposit with the Fed had an estimated 4 basis points dilutive effect
on the margin. The higher cash balances were a result of elevated escrow deposits, seasonally high commercial
deposits and increased trust demand deposits.
We estimate that the lower short-term interest rates on the Fed's July, September and October rate actions
pressured the margin by as much as 10 basis points. The linked quarter 38 basis point decline in one-month
LIBOR was another factor in the decline.
Included in that 10 basis point impact of lower rates was a decline in the overall cost of interest-bearing deposits,
the cost of which declined by 9 basis points compared with the linked quarter, which provided a benefit to the
margin of about 2 basis points.
Average loans increased $167 million compared with the previous quarter. The ongoing and planned runoff of
residential real estate loans, primarily acquired Hudson City mortgage loans, was more than offset by growth in
other loan categories, which increased in total by $509 million or 0.7% from the third quarter.
Looking at the loans by category, on an average basis, compared with the linked quarter, commercial and
industrial loans were about 1% higher than in the prior quarter. This included $110 million seasonal increase in
loans to vehicle dealers to finance their inventories, combined with an almost equal increase in other C&I loans.
Commercial real estate loans were down less than 1% compared with the third quarter, reflecting payoffs as well
as completed construction loans which did not rollover into permanent financing and a lower level of commercial
mortgage loans held for sale.
Residential real estate loans, approximately half of which were acquired in the Hudson City transaction, continued
the expected pace of paydowns and that portfolio declined by about 2% or $342 million. Consumer loans were up
3%, with growth in recreation finance loans and to a lesser extent indirect auto loans, outpacing further declines in
home equity lines and loans.
On an end of period basis, loan growth was stronger in the commercial portfolios, with commercial and industrial
loans about 3% higher than at the end of the prior quarter, while commercial real estate loans were up about 2%.
There were no particular regions or industries that stood out in terms of loan growth during the fourth quarter.
Average consumer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office as well as CDs
over $250,000, were up about 3% compared with the third quarter. As noted earlier, elevated escrow deposits,
seasonally high commercial deposits and higher levels of trust demand deposits were the drivers of that increase.
Turning to noninterest income, noninterest income totaled $521 million in the fourth quarter compared with $528
million in the prior quarter. The quarter's results included $6 million of securities valuation losses on our remaining
portfolio of GSE preferred stock compared with a $4 million gain in the third quarter.

Mortgage banking revenues were $118 million in the recent quarter compared with $137 million in the linked
quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $697 million in the quarter, down about 16%
compared with the third quarter. Nonetheless, origination revenues improved by $3 million to a total of $26 million
as a result of higher gain on sale margin.
Residential servicing revenues were little changed from the previous quarter. Total residential mortgage banking
revenues, including both origination and servicing activities, were $91 million compared with $88 million in the
prior quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $27 million in the fourth quarter compared with what
was a record $49 million in the linked quarter.
Trust income was $152 million in the recent quarter, improved from $144 million in the previous quarter and up
12% from $135 million in 2018's fourth quarter. New business generation continues to be strong, while the
strength in equity markets has been a modest tailwind. Service charges on deposit accounts were $111 million,
essentially unchanged from the prior quarter.
Trading and FX gains were $17 million, improved from $16 million in the previous quarter, primarily reflecting
customer interest rate swap activity done on behalf of commercial customers in connection with loan originations
during the quarter.
Turning to expenses, operating expenses for the fourth quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible
assets, were $819 million, down from $873 million in the third quarter. Salaries and benefits declined by $8 million
to $469 million from the prior quarter, reflecting a lower head count and seasonally lower benefit cost.
Other cost of operation for the recent quarter reflect a $16 million reduction in the valuation allowance on our
mortgage servicing rights. Recall that there was a $14 million addition to the allowance in the third quarter.
Excluding the changes in the valuation allowance, other cost of operations declined by $825 million, driven largely
by lower professional services expense.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses
from the denominator, was 53.1% in the recent quarter, improved from 55.9% in the previous quarter.
Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality continues to be pretty much in line with the trends we've been seeing
for quite a while. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 18 basis points in the fourth
quarter of 2019 compared with 16 basis points in the third quarter. The provision for credit losses was $54 million
in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $13 million. The excess provision primarily reflects loan
growth. The allowance for credit losses was $1.05 billion at the end of December.
The ratio of the allowance to total loans was 1.16% at the end of 2019, unchanged from the end of the third
quarter and up 1 basis point from the end of 2018. Nonaccrual loans declined by $42 million at December 31st
compared with the prior quarter end. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans fell 6 basis points to end the
quarter at 1.06%.
Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that have been
marked to a fair value discounted acquisition, were $519 million at the end of the quarter. Of those loans, $480
million or 93% are guaranteed by government-related entities. We'll address CECL in a few moments during the
discussion of our outlook for 2020.

Turning to capital, M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 9.72% at the end of 2019 compared with
9.81% at the end of the third quarter. Decline reflects earnings retention during the quarter, share repurchases
and the impact of loan growth, which in turn led to slightly higher end of period risk-weighted assets. M&T
repurchased 1.7 million shares of its common stock during the past quarter, costing an aggregate $282 million.
Next, I'd like to take a moment to cover the key highlights of 2019's full year results. GAAP-based diluted earnings
per common share were $13.75, up 8% from $12.74 in 2018. Net income was $1.93 billion, improved from $1.92
billion in the prior year. These results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of 1.61%
and 12.87%, respectively.
Net operating income, which excludes intangible amortization, was $1.94 billion, up slightly from the prior year.
Net operating income for 2019 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible
common shareholders' equity was 1.69% and 19.08%, respectively.
Average diluted common shares declined by 7% as a result of repurchase activity, while the total payout ratio
including common stock dividends was 102%. Tangible book value per share grew to $75.44 at the end of 2019,
up 9% from the end of 2018.
As we reflect on our 2019 performance through the lens of relative performance against our peer group of large
regional banks, we're particularly gratified by our growth in earnings per common share, our return on tangible
common equity and the absolute level of our net interest margin which remains at or near the top of the peers.

Let me just backtrack for a minute, Darren. Going back to the other cost of operations, Darren misspoke and said
there was a decline of $825 million. It is $25 million.

Darren J. King
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Thank you, Don. I'm not sure what I was looking at when I read that, but thank you for the clarification. Okay, so
let's turn to the outlook.
Looking forward into 2020, our outlook is fairly consistent with what we shared on the call last January, as well as
with the trends we've being seeing over the past quarter. While GDP growth may slow from the pace seen in
2019, we still expect it to be at a level consistent with the average annual rate of growth seen since the last
recession ended.
Unemployment remains very low and both consumer and commercial customers' financial positions are healthy.
Consumer confidence remains relatively high, although commercial customers have remained cautious as
ongoing and unpredictable global events, including disagreements over tariffs, have led to sustained levels of
uncertainty.
We were pleased to see progress toward the tailoring of capital and liquidity regulations for regional banks based
on systemic risk to the US economy. We are awaiting final approval for the capital regulations, including the
stress capital buffer, for banks in the Fed's Category 4 like M&T.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
It's still unclear whether those rules will be in place for the 2020 CCAR process. However, with the usual caveat
that events never unfold entirely in the manners you expect, here are a few thoughts for the coming year.
As we share our outlook on net interest income and the net interest margin, we'll start with the caveat that when
unfolds we'll likely be impacted by actions taken by the Federal Reserve as to short term interest rates. After a
year of volatility, including three rate cuts over the course of 2019, the markets have calmed somewhat. The
markets currently are signaling an additional rate cut in 2020 towards the end of the year.
The fourth quarter net interest margin of 3.64% is a good starting point to think about where we're headed for
2020. We expect a lower combination of cash at the Fed and investment securities as we enter the first quarter
and for that lower level to persist over the course of the year. This reflects a decline in escrow, commercial and
trust demand deposits from seasonal highs in the fourth quarter, as well as a further repositioning of our portfolio
of liquid assets as the Fed's tailoring rule for liquidity becomes effective. The result will be a beneficial impact on
the reported margin compared with the fourth quarter, which could be as much as 10 basis points.
Loans outstanding grew 2.4% on a full year average basis in 2019 and were up a similar 2.8% on a year-end
basis. As has been the case for the past few years, this reflected a 9.1% decline in residential mortgage loans on
a full year average basis, offset by 5.4% aggregate growth in other loan portfolios.
Lending activity in the commercial bank in 2019, both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate, was
characterized by better originations and a reduced level of payoffs and paydowns than was the case in 2018. We
expect those trends to continue in 2020.
As has been the case for the past several years, we will continue to allow the residential real estate portfolio to
runoff as we reposition the balance sheet to higher returning assets. However, the rate of decline on both a
percentage and absolute dollar basis will slow compared to prior years as the portfolio of loans acquired with
Hudson City becomes a smaller percentage of the total. Given these factors, our expectation for 2020 is that
average total loans will grow on a full year basis at a low single-digit pace, in line with or perhaps a little better
than what we saw in 2019.
Taken in aggregate, our outlook for 2020 reflects a lower level of earning assets, but with a higher proportion of
loans than in 2019, which improves our return profile. Combined with some improvement in the margin from what
we reported in the fourth quarter and a flat rate scenario, we expect a low single-digit decline in net interest
income on a year-over-year basis.
We enter 2020 with a higher run rate in residential mortgage servicing revenues following the additions to our
servicing and sub-servicing portfolios in 2019. Thus, year-over-year growth is sort of baked in. The outlook for
residential originations is less clear with long-term rates above the low point seen this past summer. The
commercial mortgage banking business had a record year for both volumes and revenues in 2019. Matching or
beating that will be difficult, but that's our goal for 2020.
The outlook for the remaining fee businesses remains consistent with our experience in 2019, with growth in the
low single-digit range, with the exception of trust revenues, which have been growing at a solid mid single-digit
pace. The fourth quarter's operating expenses, excluding the reduction in the MSR valuation allowance, are a
good indication for the starting run rate for modeling 2020.
Last year's GAAP results included approximately $100 million of items we do not expect to recur in 2020, the
write-down of our investment in the asset manager and the settlement of the ESOP litigation. That implies that

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
total expenses on a GAAP basis should be down year-over-year. The capabilities we added to our IT division over
the course of 2019 should enable us to continue to reduce professional services in the coming year as well. Other
than normal wage growth, we don't foresee the need to accelerate expenses beyond the current run rate.
We'd remind you that we expect our usual seasonal increase in salaries and benefits cost in the first quarter of
2020, which primarily reflects annual equity incentive compensation as well as a handful of other items. Last year,
that increase was approximately $60 million. Based on the proceeding, we expect to be able to produce neutral to
slightly positive operating leverage for the year.
Our outlook for credit remains balanced, just as we completed our sixth consecutive year of net charge-off
experience below 20 basis points. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I'll caution you again that this trend
can't continue and that losses will eventually tick upward. There continue to be some loss pressures on
nonperforming and criticized loans, but there are no apparent weaknesses in any particular industries or
geographies.
Our adoption of the new loan loss accounting standard, known as CECL, was effective January 1, 2020. Our
expectation based on forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances as of December 31, 2019 is that the
adoption will result in an overall increase of approximately $140 million or 13% to our reserves, with total
commercial reserves being down slightly, reflecting shorter contractual maturities and residential mortgage and
consumer reserves increasing substantially due to their long dated maturities.
For regulatory capital purposes, we have elected to phase in the CECL transitional amount over a three-year
period. Therefore, the effect of the adoption on the capital ratios will be recognized in a uniform manner, resulting
in a reduction to the CET1 ratio by approximately 3 basis points over each of those three years.
CECL also impacts the accounting for loans previously acquired at a discount that are on our balance sheet.
Acquired impaired loans will transition from 90 days past due and accruing to their current performance status,
whether accrual or nonaccrual. Approximately $170 million of the acquired impaired loans will transition to
nonaccrual status. The income from these loans will only be recognized on an as cash is received basis,
consistent with originated nonaccrual loans.
Lastly, in the future, our loss provision will reflect expected net charge-off activity plus CECL reserves for loan
growth by category, plus or minus changes in our reasonable and supportable forecast. We don't see anything
meaningful on the horizon that would lead us to believe that the tax rate for 2020 will be significantly different from
what it was in 2019, in the area of 25%.
As to capital, we'll continue to execute our 2019 capital plan through the end of this year's second quarter. Our
capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged, with investments in our business at high returns being our first
priority, while paying a dividend that's sustainable through economic cycles.
After that, we seek, but don't reach for acquisitions that make sense, and add value to our shareholders, our
customers and our communities. When those aren't forthcoming, we return capital to shareholders. We have little
appetite for warehousing capital over an indeterminate timeframe until those opportunities present themselves.
Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions
regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events, and other
macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.

Now, let's open up the call to questions, before which Lauri will briefly review the instructions.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, Darren, just on the expense front, I'm wondering if you can just clarify a
little bit on the point that GAAP expenses you expect to be down because they had that $100 million. And you
mentioned that the core you don't see it really changing from what the growth rate is. So the core, can you just
help us understand without having to accelerate investments what you see as the core underlying growth rate of
expenses that you should expect?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. So, I guess if you look at the full year expenses on a GAAP basis, you've got about $100 million of one-
times in the litigation, the addition of litigation reserve as well as the write-down on the asset manager. And then
when you look at that number and you look at where we grow from there, it's 1% or less.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. And then can you talk about the puts and takes just in that 1% or less? So, you're making some
investments that you've talked about in the last couple. Where you're getting the saves out of and that confidence
that you can keep it 1% or less relative to the growth that we'd seen in the last couple of years? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. When we look at the trajectory we've been on, remember that a big portion of last year's growth in
expenses was related to the mortgage business and the servicing that we both acquired and took on in the form
of sub-servicing, so we had that expense to support that revenue. And then the rest of what was happening was
this transition of our IT capabilities from professional services to salary and benefits. And we started to see those
professional services come down in the fourth quarter, which we expected, and we expect that trend to continue
into 2020.
And so as we go forward, the gains in efficiency that we will get – or expenses from reducing professional
services will offset salaries and benefits as that cycle continues itself. So, we think we're at a point where we're
self-funding and that's why we feel confident that the run rate that we're at now, we can basically run at that, ex
normal increases that happen in salaries and benefits as you go from year-to-year.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning. On that same line of questioning, the figure – operating leverage comment that you expect
positive operating leverage, that's on a GAAP basis, just to confirm, correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
That is correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. And then looking at it from what you would just walk through in terms of core, that would imply a modest
negative on a core basis then?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
On a core basis, that would, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. And then in terms of your ongoing IT and franchise investments, I know you had indicated last quarter that
they are largely complete. Is that still how you're viewing it or is there any change to the ongoing infrastructure
investments that you're making?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Well, we're continuing on the transition that we've talked about, and that really is building up our internal IT
capability. And we had the uptick in 2019 that got that process started. But from where we end the year, we're
now in a place where we're seeing professional services come down that offset the salaries and benefits costs
that we're adding as we're making those conversions.
And the place that we're at now is we think that those investments are kind of self-funding. And so that with the
expense base that we're at now, we can continue that transition without having to have meaningful growth.
As we get to the other end of it, obviously, it's our expectation that we'll continue to use those internal team
members to improve the expense run rate into 2021 and 2022, but obviously, we'll give you more details on that
when we get there. But for the purposes of 2020, we think we're at a place where we can operate basically at the
level that we're at now with some modest growth from here.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I wanted to enquire a little bit more about the potential for the margin beyond the first quarter. Heard you loud and
clear that balance sheet action is going to be quite accretive in the first quarter. If the curve stays or the curve
forecast stays static, how should we think about the net interest margin trajectory beyond the first quarter? And
also as we think of earning asset growth, should we expect earning asset growth to be flat relative to the actions
that you're taking or should we expect some balance sheet shrinkage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. So, in the first quarter, we expect the net interest margin to increase, at least what the printed margin is,
because of the change that you'll see in cash and investment securities, and you can kind of see that at the end of
period, and those lower levels we expect to persist throughout the year.
So, when you get to the first quarter margin and assuming, as you pointed out, a fairly stable rate environment,
we would expect that margin that we end the first quarter with to be fairly consistent throughout the year,
assuming that that forward curve in fact occurs, maybe plus or minus a couple of basis points along the way, but
relatively stable.
We anticipate that the average earning assets will start the year lower and then come up as the year goes on as
we see the loan growth that we talked about in the forecast that overall is kind of low single-digits, and along the
lines of what we saw in 2019 as we go through 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And my follow-up question and I apologize, you're probably going to get a 1,000 expense questions, but we
just want to make sure we're getting it right. So, as we think about the run rate for 2020, if we take $100 million
out of GAAP, that's $3.368 billion and you're saying growth of 1% or less, that includes any nominal increase in
salaries and benefits. So, in total, core should go up 1% or less from that $3.368 billion base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
That's right, yeah.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Good morning, Peter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hey, I'm just curious on the capital, you ended the year at 9.72%. I'm just wondering where you think it's going to
end in 2020? And then secondly, how much is left in your stock buyback authorization?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
So, where we'll end 2020 is a little bit tough to predict just depending on what happens with the tailoring rules and
SCB as we go into CCAR this year, which will have an impact obviously on where we might bring the capital
ratios to. And then the other thing that we're paying attention to is just the pace of loan growth and in particular
risk-weighted assets.
But if you look at where we've been over the course of the last actually kind of 5 or 6 quarters, it's been coming
down around 9 basis points to 10 basis points a quarter and we continue a measured movement down towards
the low end of the peer group. And over the course of the last year, I believe we've gone from being slightly above
our peer median in terms of our CET1 ratio to slightly below the median, and we'll continue a measured and
thoughtful move down towards the range that we've discussed for some time now, obviously, paying attention to
what's going on in the macro environment and what's happening with loan growth. And if you look at what's left
outstanding in the capital plan that we discussed or disclosed in July, it's around $750 million, $800 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And just given you're doing some of the work on remixing the balance sheet to help the margin, I'm just
wondering any updated thoughts on the hedging strategy?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Nothing that is different from what we've talked about in the past. If you look at where we've been, our notional
amount has grown, but what's actually outstanding has been relatively consistent in terms of notional dollars, it's
$14 billion, $15 billion of cash flow hedges plus another $4 billion, $5 billion of debt. And what we've been doing is
just extending some of those out into future years to have that same amount of protection in place for a little bit
longer.

Just on – just trying to ask the capital question other way, just curious – and I know you got the CCAR cycle
coming up. But given how little impact CECL has to regulatory capital levels here, just curious your thoughts on
capital return overall for the back half of the year. Is it sort of the expectation or, I don't know, the wish list that you
would continue to return 100%-plus capital of earnings?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
I guess we don't peg it as a payout ratio number that we're looking to achieve, but more we're projecting forward
what we think our loan growth will be and what our risk-weighted asset growth will be, and looking at what capital
we think we need to fund or to support that loan growth and make sure that we're running an organization that is
very safe and sound. We continue to believe that we can move the current ratio down and we'll continue to do it at
the pace that we've been on for the last several quarters, being consistent in terms of what that decline is.
Any quarter, you might see some difference between what the changes in the ratio based on primarily asset
growth in the quarter. But when you look over the long term, over the last few quarters, we've been on a pretty
steady pace. I think one of the things that we're also going to be watching as we go through the first part at least
of 2020 is just how the new CECL methodology impacts earnings on any given quarter, which will be impacted by
the mix of loan growth in that quarter and just making sure that we're thoughtful with those capital returns. But as
you pointed out, given where we are, we're pleased that impact on our capital ratios from CCEL was fairly nominal
and so we can continue on the trajectory that we've been on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay. And then just sort of a ticky-tacky question on the provision. Given – if the environment, if the credit
environment stays as is for 2020, let's hope, given the day one CECL adjustment, is it – and I know a lot more
goes into it than this, but is it sort of fair for just modeling to assume provisioning goes up by sort of that 13%
number, all else equal?

I guess, I haven't done that math. The way I tend to think about it is you've got charge-offs that will happen. And
then if you look at net growth in loans and look at the new allowance rate and multiply those two, that probably
gets you the excess provision.
And, of course, if you look in any quarter, the mix of loans that drive that shift in portfolio can move that around.
But if you look over the course of full year, we wouldn't anticipate any meaningful mix shift in terms of where the
growth is coming from on a percentage basis, which would give you that allowance percentage is a reasonable
starting point. As I said, it could move around a little bit within that quarter, but over the course of the year, I would
expect it to be within a few basis points of that number.

Steven Alexopoulos Q

Hi, Darren. How is everything?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Good. How are you, Steven?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good. I'll just start, so regarding the anticipated decline in liquidity in 1Q 2020, if we look at 1Q 2019, your quarter
recorded down $1.4 billion. Do you think you're going to have a similar decline in 1Q 2020 or is it much larger than
that, just given how much more deposit growth you've had recently?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
It's probably going to be larger than that given the trust demand business was probably the primary driver if you
look back in prior years, plus a little bit of the commercial. Commercial balances tend to move up in the fourth
quarter and then these companies as they prepare to make their distributions to their owners, that's why you see
them come down in the first quarter, and so that's pretty typical. And I think businesses are still having a little bit
more of their cash sitting in operating accounts versus in interest-bearing.
And then the other thing that's happened this year for us obviously is we've increased the escrow balances and
there is some seasonality to those. So, when you put all those factors together, you'd probably get a bigger
decrease there. And then we'll be looking at the securities portfolio in aggregate and that will probably come down
a little bit too as we react to the new changes in the LCR.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, got you. And then on the trust income which came in much stronger than the original guidance called for it,
and it didn't sound like market appreciation was a big factor, give me more color on why that was so strong this
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
So there's a couple of things that happened there. We have within there a business that holds retirement assets.
And when you add claims to that, they can come in in big chunks and we've had one big retirement fund that
came in during the course of year, that's kind of hard to predict, and that helped with some of the trust fees as well
as in our, what we call, our institutional client services business, there seem to be a little bit more activity in that
business as the back half of the year went on, which helped with the trust fees. And, obviously, when I talked
about that retirement business, the assets that came on also grew because of the markets. And so there was
some help from the markets to be sure, but the business continues to add team members and add clients and has
had a strong year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, that's helpful. Maybe just one final one on expenses, I appreciate the color on the 1% expense growth in
2020, given the reinvestment some of the cost saves. But what is expense growth at M&T running at these days
without cost saves, what's the natural organic growth rate of expenses? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
When I think about our natural organic growth rate and you look at us through time and you hold to the side some
of the things that have happened with various litigation expenses or mortgage servicing rights or the write-off that
we had, we're kind of a low single-digit grower and that's mainly driven by compensation costs year-over-year.
Last year was just kind of outsized because of the mortgage – the growth of the mortgage servicing business and
then step one in our transformation for technology. But generally when you look at how we run the bank, we pay a
lot of attention to our growth rate in expenses because we know we're in a tough industry. And so we're always
looking for ways to manage those and keep them in aggregate growing at low single-digits and making
investments and finding offsets to cover the cost to keep it at that pace and that philosophy hasn't changed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

How are you, Gerard?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good. Can you give us some color on that residential mortgage portfolio? You indicated it was down, I think, the
runoff that is, down about 9%. You expect it to be less this year. It looks like your resi mortgages at the end of the
year just over $16 billion or 18% of total loans. Where do you see that eventually bottoming out? When does the
runoff from the deal that you've done and we have a stabilized number from that portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. It's a good question, Gerard. As we watch the portfolio of residential mortgage loans, when you look
underneath there, it's down to about half legacy Hudson City mortgages and half legacy M&T, plus new
originations. We're allowing that Hudson City portfolio to run down and we'll continue to just because of the return
profile of the mortgage business.
And the rate of growth or the rate of decline in aggregate in the mortgage portfolio is slowing just because the
Hudson City mortgages are becoming a smaller percentage. But we'll continue to run those down, well probably
you'll see a little bit more growth in the legacy business, especially some of that comes from the servicing
business. But you're not going to see it, it hit a steady state likely in 2020.
The only thing that – as we work through the new liquidity rules after the tailoring that we're contemplating as what
role the mortgage portfolio plays in overall funding since the mortgages are pledgeable with the Federal Home
Loan Bank for funding on a short-term basis. So there is a number of considerations that go into where that
portfolio ultimately ends, but we probably continue seeing it move down, but in a smaller dollar amount over the
course of 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then I know the rules are not set yet on the SCB, but from what you understand today and
assuming they don't vary dramatically from what we all understand, do you expect any kind of meaningful impact
come CCAR because of – if they incorporate the SCB in CCAR this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
I guess, if they incorporate it, it would be helpful because the threshold that you have to meet would be lower and
there'll be some opportunity there. There's also been talk of not having to prefund the dividend and not having an
assumption of asset growth under stress, which all of those things are positive.

The offset to that is what our loan growth assumptions look like and, in particular, what the mix is in terms of risk-
weighted assets that will be an offset. But it's obviously remains to be seen how this will be implemented by the
Fed, given that there is unlikely to be an NPR before and it will all be handled through the rules and the
assumptions that are provided to us.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess we have 10 more minutes. A couple of questions, one just a follow-up on
CECL. By my calculations, your ACL ratio goes roughly from about 115 basis points to about 130 basis points. As
I think about the changes in you mix and the loss content on your net loan growth, because there is obviously a
lot going on there with resi coming down, consumer going up, how do I think about the loss content, the lifetime
losses on your growth relative to your back book? Is the net growth in loans those with lifetime loss of above 130
basis points, I know it doesn't change in any given quarter all that much, but should we think that ACL ratio
naturally gravitate upwards over time as your balance sheet remixes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
I guess if your time horizon is 10 years and we don't do anything to change the growth rates of the various
portfolios, that's probably true. I think if you look in the short-term, and short-term in this case will be like over the
next 12 to 24 months, you probably don't see much change in that just because the start point on some of those
other portfolios, meaning the other consumer, is relatively small as a percentage compared to the resi mortgage,
the commercial real estate and the C&I.
And that assumes that we don't do anything to look at those portfolios and look for alternatives like you're seeing
some of the other organizations thinking about auto securitizations for instance. We haven't done one of those in
a while. I'm not suggesting that we are going to do one, but that would have an impact on obviously the portfolio
and the allowance in there, because if you did a securitization, that allowance would come off, so. A number of
moving factors, but I guess the short answer to your question is your math is consistent with ours. And I think it
would take at least a couple of years of running at the rate that we're at with no change to see that number go up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, that's helpful, all right. Let me just change gears a little bit. At a conference in early November, I think it was
the BAAB conference, you highlighted some of your key metrics versus your long-term averages and your NIM, I
think, you were at substantially higher than what, the premium of your NIM, the delta between your NIM and the
peer median was substantially higher today than it has been historically.
I think it was like 50 basis points or something like that, and historically it's 20 basis points or something,
something in that neighborhood. It seems like from your outlook you think that really elevated delta with your peer
group should remain not too far from where it is today. And I think you were kind of hinting at the conference that
maybe that excess NIM versus your peers will gravitate down over time. Am I reading that right? I mean, what's

changed since November, other than obviously the rate outlook, but am I reading that right that you think you will
be able to maintain a premium NIM that is historically high?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
I guess I'll break apart your statement into two pieces. Do we think we'll be able to maintain a premium NIM, yes,
that's kind of always been the nature of our portfolio, largely because of our funding mix, but also because of the
pricing on our loan book. It's been a little higher than what we would normally expect and especially in this kind of
time period. And you can see that the gap between us and the next closest peer, the median has come down a
little bit. But really when you look over the last couple of quarters, it's has been fairly consistent.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
We would need to see rates come down a little bit further to see that delta compress. But we expect over time [ph]
that we try to run the bank (53:41) to have a slightly lower cost of deposit and a slightly higher yield on our loans,
and manage our expenses a little bit better in credit. It's not our objective to be outsized performance in any one
of those categories, but a little bit better in each one.
And over long periods of time that adds up to consistent returns, which is really what our objective is, and some of
them may move a little bit in any one time period, be that a quarter or a year. But over long periods of time, that's
kind of how we try to run the bank to achieve the returns that we do.
So we expect that the margin – obviously, given the earlier comments, in a stable rate environment, we expect
the margin to be relatively stable this year, given that we would expect to maintain our premium over the – our
gap, our positive gap compared to the next closest in the median, but any movement down and you'll probably
see a little bit of that road, but we don't see ending up back at the median.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Right. So, as long as the rate environment remains stable, that historically high delta, there's no reason why that
should compress?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A

Yeah, from what we can see, we believe that that will persist.

But I think I do have five minutes left in the morning. I think that's what Saul was referring to before we say good
afternoon, but I just had two really quick follow-ups. I know you've had all kinds of questions today on both of
these topics. So, just want to clarify a little bit on the margin guidance, the 10 basis points, Darren. Now, is that all
liquidity driven 10 basis points or I think you guys, whether it's like December or early January, I think you
redeemed some debt, so that kind of factored into that sort of 10 basis points NIM improvement into the early part
of 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A

and securities.

Brian Klock Q

Got it, got it, it makes sense. And again on expenses, this is a 2021 question, but like you mentioned here, the
core expense run rate call it less than 1% inflation in 2020 on a core basis. And it feels like with all those tax
expenses kind of consolidated and coming out like you said in recycling, do you think 2021 is one of those where
expenses are flat or is it just maybe normal M&T expense inflation out into 2021?

growth and make sure that we see a path, if we make those investments to bring it back down or that there is
offsetting revenue like we did with the mortgage business this year. The low single-digit increase, as I mentioned
before, is primarily the result of salary inflation. Who knows where wage inflation ends up through 2020, if
unemployment rate stays as low, who knows where we will end up.
But we continue to believe that in the banking business, efficiency matters, and being cost effective matters. So,
we pay a lot of attention to that. And then, of course, if we can drive that growth down to something less than 1%
or even negative, we will look to do that, but too early for me to make comments really about where that will be in
2021.
