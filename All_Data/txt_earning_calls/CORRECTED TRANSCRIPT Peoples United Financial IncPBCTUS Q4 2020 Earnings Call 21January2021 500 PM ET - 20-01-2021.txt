Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
John P. Barnes
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. I hope you and your loved ones
are remaining safe and healthy. Let's begin by turning to the full-year overview on slide 2. We are pleased with
our performance in 2020, especially in light of the uncertain economic environment caused by the pandemic. Full-
year financial and operating results were strong and reflect the resilience of People's United, its employees, and
customers.
Net income of $573 million increased 10% from a year ago, and on a per common share basis, net income was
up $0.05 to $1.32. Operating earnings of $535 million or $1.27 per common share declined 3% and $0.12,
respectively. It's important to note we completed the sale of the People's United Insurance Agency in November
and realized a pre-tax gain, net of expenses, of $75.9 million, which is not included in operating earnings.
Pre-provision net revenue of $827 million increased $89 million or 12% from a year ago, reflecting the success of
recent acquisitions and solid execution across core operations. Total operating revenues of nearly $2 billion
increased 8.5%, driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by modestly lower fee revenues.
Operating expenses of $1.165 billion, which includes a full year of United and Belmont's results, were up 6%.
Notably, operating expenses ended the year below the level – the lower end of the 2021 outlook range we
provided a year ago of $1.19 billion. The increase in revenues, along with our continued emphasis on controlling
expenses and realizing projected cost savings from acquisitions, lowered the full-year efficiency ratio 160 basis
points to 54.2%, marking the seventh consecutive year of improvement.
Turning to the balance sheet, period-end loans and deposits increased to 1% and 20%, respectively, from year-
end 2019. Excluding PPP, the loan portfolio decreased approximately $2 billion or 5%, driven by lower retail
balances of approximately $2.3 billion, modestly offset by commercial loan growth of $251 million. The decline in
retail balances was mostly due to our planned reduction of residential mortgages as we remixed the balance
sheet with a focus on higher yielding portfolios. The impact of the pandemic on the economy was evident in the
commercial portfolio throughout the year. Demand within the commercial real estate and C&I middle market
businesses was limited due to reduced economic activity and funding provided by PPP loans.
Conversely, our mortgage warehouse and lease businesses experienced strong growth. Mortgage warehouse
ended 2020 with a record balances of $3.4 billion, which more than doubled from 2019, while lease period-end
balances increased 19% from the prior year. The lease which we acquired in 2017 has been a terrific addition to
People's United franchise. We've had successfully leveraged the liquidity and funding provided by the bank and
other synergies to achieve significant growth, while maintaining both excellent asset quality and high yields.
Lease balances ended 2020 at nearly $2 billion, up from approximately $730 million at the time of the acquisition.
Asset quality remained excellent, as net charge-offs to average total loans were 11 basis points for the full year.
These results are indicative of the company's conservative approach to underwriting, diversified loan portfolio,
and deep customer relationships. We are particularly pleased by the continued reduction in loan deferrals, which
ended the year at $271 million or 0.6% of total loans, down from $1.6 billion or 3.5% of total loans at the close of
the third quarter.
Additionally, deferrals have continued to decline since year-end. As of January 15, total deferrals were down to
$110 million or less than 0.3% of total loans. We remain committed to supporting our high quality customer base
and help them navigate these difficult economic times. Consistent with our intentions discussed last quarter, we
provided post-second deferral modifications to customers in need of further assistance. Approximately $1 billion in

loans received modifications. The majority of the modifications are in commercial real estate, with the largest
concentration within the hospitality sector, as expected.
Moving on to slide 3, as consumer preferences evolve to more digitally-driven experiences, we have continually
enhanced our technology capabilities to deliver value, provide convenience, and create efficiencies. As a result,
customers are increasingly utilizing our online and mobile platforms for their banking needs.
Given these accelerating digital banking trends and shifts in retail shopping behaviors, we announced today the
decision not to renew our existing in-store branch contracts with Stop & Shop in Connecticut and New York upon
expiration. We operate 140 Stop & Shop branches, 84 in Connecticut and 56 in New York. Our contract in
Connecticut expires at the end of January 2022, while the New York contract goes to mid-year 2022. Currently,
discussions with Stop & Shop on renewal terms are ongoing.
Although our Stop & Shop relationship has provided meaningful value to the bank and its customers over more
than two decades, this decision provides us the opportunity to further optimize our branch network while providing
the same level of personalized service across each of our channels. In addition, cost savings achieved over time
by not renewing these contracts will enable further investment in our digital capabilities and traditional branch
network.
We remain committed to serving customers in the manner in which they want to interact with us, whether it be in
person, at a branch, virtually through our online and mobile platforms, or a combination of both. We are confident
customer and deposit retention will be very strong due to the customer portfolio profile of our Stop & Shop
branches, increasing adoption of digital platforms, expanded traditional branch footprint, proximity between in-
store and traditional locations, and trends in retail shopping behavior.
While in-store branches comprise approximately half of our total branches in Connecticut and New York, only
40% of the customers and 30% of the deposit balances are domiciled in these locations. In addition, the in-store
customers carry balances that are only 64% of traditional branch customers. Furthermore, only 20% of our branch
deposit balances in these two states are associated with customers that actually visited an in-store branch in
2020.
As previously mentioned, customers are increasingly utilizing our online and mobile platforms. Digital engagement
has increased significantly year-over-year. For example, mobile logons are up 40%, digital enrollments have
increased 25%, mobile wallet transactions are up 162%, and we have experienced a 66% increase in active
mobile deposit customers. Notably, our in-store customers are 13% more digitally active than those at traditional
branches, and only 10% of deposit balances are associated with customers that used Stop & Shop branches in
2020 but did not utilize a digital channel.
Importantly, the strength of our hub-and-spoke branch model we built over time created a high level of overlap
between our in-store and traditional branches. As such, 75% of our Stop & Shop branches and 77% of our Stop &
Shop branch deposits are domiciled within five miles of one of our traditional locations. In addition, recent bank
acquisitions of Suffolk in New York, Farmington [ph] and United (00:11:36) in Connecticut have expanded and
better optimized our traditional branch footprint in these states, as well as provided customers a greater number
of convenient drive-up facilities.
Finally, changing trends in retail shopping behavior has become apparent. The availability of delivery and
curbside pickup options, which have become more prominent during the pandemic, have impacted foot traffic

inside stores. Additionally, discount stores and wholesale clubs and convenience stores have increased their
share of grocery spend, while share of the traditional grocery stores has declined.
With that, here is David to discuss the fourth quarter results.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Jack. I will begin on slide 4 with an overview of the fourth quarter. We concluded the year with a solid
financial performance in the fourth quarter. Operating earnings of $147.7 million increased 2% linked quarter. On
a per common share basis, operating earnings were $0.35, up $0.01.
Provision for credit losses on loans decreased for the second consecutive quarter to $14.7 million, and further
strengthened the allowance for credit losses to total loans by 3 basis points to 97 basis points, or 102 basis
points, excluding PPP loans.
Operating pre-provision net revenue of $196.6 million declined 3% from the third quarter due to modestly lower
net interest income, partially offset by slightly higher fee income and lower expenses. Finally, it is important to
note the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter reflected a $7.1 million benefit related to the revaluation of certain
state deferred tax assets.
Moving to slide 5, net interest income of $382.8 million decreased $8.6 million or 2% from the third quarter. The
decline was driven by the loan portfolio, which unfavorably impacted net interest income by $15.5 million. This
headwind was partially offset by lower deposit costs, which benefited net interest income by $6.4 million. Lower
borrowings and higher balances in the securities portfolio also collectively benefited net interest income by
$500,000.
Notably, during 2020, we have reduced borrowings by over $4 billion on a period-end basis, as a result of $8.5
billion of deposit growth since the beginning of the year. Net interest income included $20 million from PPP during
the quarter, which consists of $15.4 million in fees and $4.6 million in net interest income. These results reflect $6
million related to loans forgiven in the quarter.
As displayed on slide 6, net interest margin of 2.84% was 13 basis points lower than the third quarter, primarily
due to increased excess liquidity, which unfavorably impacted the margin by 9 basis points. Lower yields in the
loan and securities portfolios also unfavorably impacted the margin by 7 basis points and 2 basis points,
respectively. In the loan portfolio, new business yields remained lower than the total portfolio yield. However, new
business yields and credit spreads modestly improved in the quarter. The largest offset to these negative effects
was our continued discipline managing deposit pricing, which benefited the margin by 5 basis points.
Average deposit costs were 24 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to 29 basis points in the third quarter,
marking the sixth consecutive quarter of lower deposit costs. Finally, PPP had a 2 basis point favorable impact on
net interest margin for the quarter.
Turning to loans on slide 7. Average balances were down $792 million or 2% from the third quarter, while period
end loans decreased approximately $1.4 billion or 3%. The loan portfolio continues to be impacted by reduced
retail balances and a low demand for our commercial real estate and middle market C&I businesses due to limited
economic activity. On a period end basis, retail loans decreased $715 million mostly attributable to our planned
reduction in residential mortgages which lowered balances by $577 million from the close of the third quarter.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Commercial loans were down $647 million which included a $289 million decline in PPP balances due to
forgiveness and a combined $107 million reduction in our runoff portfolios. Conversely, loans benefited from
record mortgage warehouse balances and strong growth by LEAF. Mortgage warehouse period end balances
closed the quarter at $3.4 billion, up $161 million from September 30 as results continue to be driven by robust
mortgage origination activity and the addition of new customer relationships.
Lease average and period end balances grew 5% and 6%, respectively, from the third quarter. Balances in the
transactional portion of the New York multifamily portfolio, which is in runoff mode, ended the quarter at $512
million, down $47 million linked-quarter and $225 million for the year. In addition, the period-end balance for the
United loans we have chosen to run off was $845 million, a decline of $60 million from September 30 and $268
million since year-end 2019.
Moving to deposits on slide 8, average balances were up $1.1 billion or 2% from the third quarter, while period-
end balances grew $2.5 billion or 5%. The growth, which helped to lower the loan-to-deposit ratio to 84%, was
broad-based as balances increased across our retail, commercial, and municipal businesses.
Both average and period-end balances were up across all categories with the exception of time deposits as
higher cost CDs rolled off. Average time balances decreased $865 million linked-quarter. While on a period-end
basis, balances were down $668 million. The decrease in time deposits is a reflection of customer preference for
liquidity during this uncertain economic and low interest rate environment.
Importantly, period-end non-interest-bearing deposits increased for the seventh consecutive quarter. Balances of
$15.9 billion were up $1.8 billion from the end of the third quarter and $6.1 billion for the year. Non-interest
bearing deposits now account for more than 30% of total period-end balances, up from 22% a year ago.
Turning to slide 9,non-interest income of $178.2 million increased $77.1 million or 76% linked quarter. As
referenced earlier, we completed the sale of People's United Insurance Agency realizing a $75.9 million gain.
Excluding this gain, operating non-interest income of $102.3 million grew $1.2 million or 1% from the third quarter.
This increase was driven by commercial bank lending fees which were up $2.8 million primarily driven by higher
[ph] pre (00:20:36) loan prepayment fees, an increase in customer interest rate swap income of $1 million and
higher operating lease income and cash management fees which collectively benefited non-interest income by
$800,000. In addition, other non-interest income was up $2.2 million primarily due to the mark-to-market of one
equity security position. The largest offset to these increases was a $5.6 million reduction in insurance revenues
due to the sale of PUIA in early November.
On slide 10, non-interest expense of $293.4 million decreased $200,000 linked quarter. The fourth quarter
included $4.9 million of non-operating costs, an increase of $300,000 compared to the third quarter and they were
in the following categories: $3.8 million in other non-interest expense; $800,000 in professional and outside
services; and $300,000 in equipment – in occupancy and equipment.
Excluding non-operating costs, non-interest expense of $288.5 million decreased $500,000 compared to the
previous quarter. Non-interest expense benefited from lower regulatory assessment and operating lease expense
which were down $1.5 million and $800,000 respectively from the third quarter. Conversely, non-interest expense
was unfavorably impacted by higher costs in occupancy and equipment of $2.4 million due to seasonality in
professional and outside services of $1.4 million related to the timing of projects.
Briefly, on slide 11, the efficiency ratio of 55.5% increased 170 basis points linked quarter primarily due to
modestly lower revenues. As I stated last quarter, we will remain very diligent in our management of expenses

and continue to be focused on enhancing operating leverage as we move forward in this current low interest rate
environment. As Jack mentioned earlier, our asset quality remains excellent.
As displayed on slide 12, net loan charge-offs to average total loans of 12 basis points improved 3 basis points
linked quarter. Non-performing assets as a percentage of loans at REO of 78 basis points was 7 basis points
higher compared to the third quarter. This increase was attributable to our motor coach portfolio in the People's
Capital and Leasing business within equipment finance. The motor coach segment has been significantly
impacted by the pandemic, primarily due to the decline in tourism.
Looking at slide 13, it is evident the gain related to the PUIA sale had a significant favorable impact on fourth
quarter returns. However, on an operating basis, returns were generally consistent with the third quarter.
Operating return on average assets of 95 basis points increased 1 basis point while operating return on average
tangible equity of 13.3% was down slightly from 13.4%.
Finally, on slide 14, capital ratios continue to be strong given our diversified business mix and long history of
exceptional risk management. It is again important to note adjusting for PPP loans the pro forma Tier 1 leverage
ratio at quarter end is 8.7% for the holding company compared to 8.4% and 9.1% for the bank compared to 8.7%.
Additionally, the TCE ratio, excluding PPP, is approximately 7.8% compared to the reported 7.5%.
Before turning the call over to Jack to go over our 2021 outlook, I wanted to mention that we are still in the
process of performing our annual goodwill impairment assessment. Additional time is necessary to complete the
analysis given the complexities brought about by the macroeconomic effects of the pandemic particularly the
current and projected low interest rate environment and the decline in bank stock valuations last fall including on
the company's annual assessment date of October 1. Any potential goodwill impairment charge could be material
to reported earnings but would represent a non-cash charge and have no effect on cash balances, liquidity or
tangible equity. In addition, because goodwill and other intangible assets are not included in the calculation of
regulatory capital, our well-capitalized regulatory capital ratios would not be affected by this potential non-cash
expense. The analysis will be completed prior to the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jack.

John P. Barnes
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Thank you, David. Looking forward, we are cautiously optimistic about the economy as society continues to adjust
to the pandemic. In particular, we are pleased banking activity trends continue to improve despite ongoing social
distancing protocols. We are also hopeful the vaccines will help restore a bit of normalcy and potentially help to
accelerate economic improvement in the latter half of the year. However, a lot of uncertainty remains.
While we enter 2021 in a position of strength, the recent surge in the virus nationwide and a prolonged low
interest rate environment present a challenging backdrop for loan growth, net interest income and margin. Despite
these headwinds, we are very confident in the resilience of our franchise to maintain strong execution across our
operations, further invest in digital capabilities and deliver exceptional service to customers.
With that backdrop in mind, let me outline our full year outlook for 2021 as listed on slide 15. It is important to note
our announcement today on the decision not to renew our existing in-store branch contracts with Stop & Shop will
not have an impact on 2021 financial results.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
We expect to grow loans excluding PPP balances in the range of 0% to 3% on period-end basis. PPP balances
totaling $2.3 billion at year-end, our current expectation is that these loans will be forgiven in the first half of 2021.
Secondly, we anticipated period-end deposit balances to change in the range of down 2% to up 2%. This
expectation is reflective of the significant deposit growth in 2020 and uncertainty of additional government
stimulus measures.
We expect net interest income to decrease in the range of 2% to 4%. Embedded in this outlook is the expectation
for net interest margin to be in the range of 2.85% to 2.95%. This net interest margin range is derived from many
different factors one of which is an assumption of no change in the Fed funds rate during the year.
Operating non-interest income is expected to grow in the range of 1% to 3% from an adjusted 2020 operating
base of $372 million which excludes $28 million of non-interest income from the PUIA and a $17 million gain on
the sale of loans acquired in the United transactions. Operating non-interest expense which excludes merger-
related cost is anticipated to be in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.18 billion as compared to $1.142 billion in 2020
which excludes $23 million of People's United Insurance expense. This expense outlook reflects our continued
commitment to invest in digital capabilities to further enhance efficiencies and convenience of customers.
We also expect to maintain excellent credit quality with a provision in the range of $60 million to $80 million. The
wider range compared to prior year outlook is indicative of continued uncertainty caused by the pandemic. In
addition, we anticipate our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 20% to 22%. Finally, we plan to
maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that at year-end holding company Common Equity Tier 1 capital
ratio will be in the range of 10% to 10.5%.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, can
you please proceed to the Q&A portion of the call?

Q
Just following up on the Stop & Shop commentary, I understand it's a 2022 event. Maybe could you help us think
about some of the financial impacts like deposit attrition, maybe fees and expenses granted. I think you
mentioned earlier that there will be expense kind of reallocated in some of the investment side but just trying to
get a feel for how 2022 can shake out. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure. Thank you for recognizing this is a big strategic decision for us but it really doesn't have much of an impact
in or it doesn't have an impact in 2021. When we look out, the total cost to run the combined states Stop & Shop
including grant, comp and equipment, etcetera, is a number in the $60 million to $70 million range. So there's a
large opportunity for us over time in that.
And as we – as Jack said in his comments, we've got – there's contractual rundown periods for this. So, from a
financial perspective, there's a large opportunity for us over time. We've spent a lot of time on this decision
thinking about it. And the – Jack went through a lot of statistics in his prepared comments about seeing
substantially higher levels of digital engagement. The fact that some of the recent acquisitions have changed the
complexion of our traditional branch network which gives us confidence that we can do this with a very
reasonable and small risk of deposit attrition over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
We have a pretty long track record of closing branches, optimizing the branch system over time. And we've been
really successful at retaining customers, basically, redirecting them to nearby branches. And so that gives us a lot
of confidence. We have described over the years a kind of a hub and spoke approach to the way we've
established our branch system in Connecticut and we were able to replicate that some in New York. And it really
is that many of our Stop & Shop branches are fairly close to traditional branch. So we've always recognized that
as a business model risk going into the in-stores. And we intentionally created that hub and spoke approach. And

as the world has changed and customers' preferences have changed, we now feel we need to take advantage of
the expiration of these contracts and take this strategic step.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Thanks for that. And just switching over to the loan growth side, there are some headwinds. There's expected
runoffs still going on in resi and multi-family in the United book. I guess what are the key drivers for kind of the net
loan growth as we look at 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Hi. It's David. Growth is, as I go down the balance sheet, the continued success that we've had in equipment
finance and I would say particularly led by LEAF, some of the specialized industry verticals that we've talked
about in the past whether it's franchise lending, fund banking, etcetera.
In 2020, as a plan strategy, when we were remixing the balance sheet, we also faced the headwind of a declining
residential mortgage portfolio. That process, from our perspective has – we've gotten to where we want to be for
an allocation of the balance sheet. So, as we look forward, we'll start to see some growth in the residential
mortgage line.
Mortgage warehouse is – had a banner year, obviously, in 2020. But rates are low. Refinance opportunities are
still out there for a large part of the mortgage universe. So we think we will be able to hold balances fairly well in
that business. Those positives, I would say, are offset by continued reduced activity in our commercial real estate
book.

Hey. Good evening, guys. Just on that last question in terms of runoff in acquired loans and runoff in New York
City multifamily, what do you guys have left in that, or what are you expecting for this year, maybe?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure, Dave. Good question. So the New York multifamily was – ended the year at $512 million, so that came
down $225 million in 2020. We think runoff next year will probably be $100 million to $150 million. And then in the
United portfolio, we ended the year in the runoff section of that portfolio of $845 million. So that came down $268
million last year. We think the runoff there will be about $200 million to $300 million.

NIM. So just wondering what you see driving that if it's just an unwind of some of the effects of liquidity build or
maybe the PPP forgiveness fees or something like that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I think you hit on most of what I was going to bring up, Dave. So the $285 million to $295 million is, as
Jack said – it's predicated on no change in the Fed funds rate for the year. We have seen a modest steepening of
the yield curve and think we'll see a bit more as the year unfolds. Some of the components that we're thinking
about, the one that really came to bear on the margin in the fourth quarter was the excess liquidity, right? So we
had – if you look on the short-term investment line in the press release, you'll see that we were up $3.3 billion in
the fourth quarter.
The reality is that money is sitting at the Fed right now at 10 basis points. So that had in 2020 in the fourth quarter
a 9 basis point negative impact to the margin. We invested. We grew the securities portfolio about $1 billion in the
fourth quarter and we are continuing to deploy some of that excess liquidity into the securities market. So, we'll be
able to reverse some of that 9 basis point drag there. I think that will probably offset some of the positive benefit
we think we'll get in the payoff of the PPPs, right which, in Jack's comments, talked about in the first half of the
year.
So, about half of our loan book is floating and it's really not going to change much. But half of the loan book is
fixed rate and there's about $5 billion in equipment financing there that cash flows fairly nicely. And each quarter
we expect to get a little better reinvestment yields on that half of the loan portfolio. So that and deploying some of
that excess liquidity and picking up a little over 100 basis points to 120 basis points on that excess liquidity are
some of the major drivers we're thinking about around that loan guidance -- around the margin guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Yeah. And so for the NII [indiscernible] (00:41:07), how much in the way of securities growth does that
bake in for the year at this point roughly?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
For 2020, there's call it about another $1 billion net growth.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. Great. And then maybe just switching to capital real quick. It looks like you're already at the top of your
target CET1 range. So I was just wondering what you're thinking about in terms of maybe buybacks or M&A.
You've got one growth in your guide. So you'll need some to support that. But if you're already in the top your
range and you're making more money, you may have some extra to do something with.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. True. We are at the top of the range. And we didn't feel we wanted to change the range in the guidance or
from an outlook perspective. The reality is, and we talked about this I think last quarter when we announced the
insurance sale, that was about 15 basis points boost equity levels. We continue to think about and once in a while
talk to our board about buybacks. And that is certainly something that might happen over the course of the year.
It's not planned today. It's not in our guidance. But it is definitely just one of those capital management tools that
we have regular periodic discussions with our board around.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John P. Barnes A

It's Jack. I would say no updated thoughts. And I think we continue to look at the environment and have
discussions with the people. And obviously, there's been a lot that's happened out there. I think the challenges
around the environment certainly causing people to at least look at their strategic alternatives and consider that as
opposed to continuing to fight a way here.

Hey, Mark.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just a quick -- a couple of quick follow-ups on the in-store thing and I apologize if you mentioned this but how
many of the in-store locations can you exit in 2022?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A

How many can we close in 2022?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q

Exactly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
By the end of 2022, they will all have been closed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
And, Mark, there was an original agreed upon schedule. I think it's, yeah, 2023.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
So all through 2023. And that's well-laid out and it's kind of agreed 10 years ago [indiscernible] (00:44:20) actually
20 years ago with both parties in an orderly unwind if there was one would kind of go by county. And we don't
have our fingertips on that [indiscernible] (00:44:33) right here. But we'll – we can, we'll begin to share that as we
move through this. But we are -- we indicated we're actively talking with the Stop & Shop and we are about both
those schedules and also where we might continue working with them. It won't be in a big footprint but we believe
that we will reach some agreement with them following those discussions.

And presumably, Jack, they'll bring in another partner. So I guess I'm curious do these branches have to stay dark
for a period of time after you close them before somebody else could sort of move in there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
No. We watch the in-store market pretty closely, Mark, as you can imagine. And in-store presence across the
industry has been in decline for some time. That would be an awfully big thing for anybody to take on. And we're
not expecting they will. So that's our view on that. And we have traditional branches close by so we like I said
we're confident we'll move those customers to the traditional branches and be successful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
But I'm expecting it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And then, David, I'm curious on -- you touched upon the $3 billion of short term investments. Did I hear correctly
that you expect to put about $1 billion to that to work in the securities portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yes, Mark. So we grew the securities portfolio about $1 billion on a net basis in Q4. At the end of the year, we
were sitting on $3.7 billion in change of liquidity. And that was up in the quarter of $3.3 billion. So about half – our
current thinking is about $1 billion of that $3.3 billion. At least right now, we will deploy in the first half of 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Thank you. And then just lastly to follow-up on the M&A question, Jack, it sounds like there's a lot of things
going on out there. Could you envision doing a bigger sort of MOE kind of transaction? Is that something that you
would consider?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
I would say that we look at the landscape all the time, and there's at least some potential, eventually, that we
would consider that with the right partner, I would say. I definitely would not say absolutely not. Those are difficult
but certainly possible. I don't – I guess I would say it this way as well, we're really confident in our track record
and execution on M&A. And if we felt like there was an appropriate thing there, I wouldn't – I would feel very good
about our talented folks going and taking something on there. But those are low probabilities.

Hey. Good afternoon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hi, Chris.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, guys. I just want to – sorry for going back to the Stop & Shop. I just want to make sure I get the impact right.
I think you guys said $60 million to $70 million of expenses related to this action. Nothing this year but next year
before any reinvestment, that would be the savings from that. I guess number one is, is that the right way to think
about it? And we've seen others do branch closures, and maybe 50% gets reinvested. Is that – am I in the zip
code about how you're thinking about potential net savings in 2022?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
So that $60 million to $70 million is our all-in cost for the totality of Stop & Shop branches in both states. So that's
rent, comp and benefits, occupancy, all-in. We did not say what percentage of that would be reinvested
specifically but that is the opportunity from a cost savings.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We're already investing in our digital capabilities very steadily for years and we're certainly committed again
in 2021 to follow this year where it simply made a point that it is going to give us the capabilities to use some of it.
But I wouldn't use the thought of 50%. I don't think, as I sit here today, that we would feel like we would need that
much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So that net benefit would be a 2022 event. I got it. Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Just one more on the PPP. I think you gave the numbers of what was in the quarter
about $20 million. How much – what's left on the fees? And then, secondarily, what are the thoughts on the round
two at participation?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure. So, in 2020, the total net interest impact of fees and interest income was $47 million, now that was over
three quarters, obviously, second, third, and it was ramping up over that period of time. We're making the
assumption that what remains on the books will all be forgiven in the first two quarters of the year 2020. That
number is just about the same amount. It's about $50 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's total between the 1% and the fees, correct? Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. That's the total. And then...

Great. Thanks for taking...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
So, we're actually calling what's going on right now PPP3 internally, and that's just starting to ramp up. It's – we've
only been added two days now. And our thoughts around that are not embedded...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
...in the outlook we're sharing today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
I'll just share, I think it was this morning, that approximately 2,500 applications already, mostly on the small size,
less than $150,000, and good utilization of our technology and our portal of customers actually making the
applications themselves and not needing to engage with our bankers. So, it's early but it seems to be active.
We're not expecting it's going to be anywhere near PPP1, but we don't know. So, we'll see.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Great. Thanks. Maybe just a little more a theoretical question for you, if you don't mind, when I always think
about banks and branches, obviously, people have not been going into them as much but they're definitely used
as a marketing tool, and it's great to just have that brand presence out there. Just like – because I shop at Stop &
Shop, I see People's, it's definitely very helpful. Like how are you guys thinking about that aspect of it? Like [ph]
actually (00:53:00) more specifically, how do you think about growing the business without sort of that, I'm going
to say "free marketing" of having branches in many more locations?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I appreciate what you're saying and noting that. And I think traditional branches do that for us as well,
right, and historically always have, and even a bigger presence, and we're very much committed to that, meaning
bigger signage and more cars going by, et cetera. So, that – and I – the other thing in terms of growing the
business, we are doing so much more in the digital marketing space than – it's just ramping up incredibly fast.
And so, our messaging to people is coming more through the technology and the cellphone and the computer
with offers and visibility on product and what the brand is doing. What – also, what we're doing in the community,
and we use digital a lot to talk about our community activities and the foundation as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a separate question, in terms of the goodwill write-down – or the
goodwill impairment test that you're doing, I guess I – maybe that caught me a little bit off guard. I wouldn't expect
in this environment that we would see any goodwill write-downs. Can you just talk about what parts of your
business are potentially subject that might [ph] impose (00:54:41) a risk of a write-down? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, Ken, it's David. So, what we try to say in those prepared remarks and in the press release is this is an
accounting exercise. The date that we do this happens to be October 1. So, a part of that process – a complicated
process has to do with market cap on the day of assessment, as which, for us, we have a $10.17 stock price, $4.3
billion market cap.
Also, there is analysis relative to peers. Us and the peers were all trading about 0.8 to 1.1 times tangible book
value. So, that is a piece of it. So, you run that assessment, that accounting exercise, over the units that we report
in our public documents, so that's just commercial, retail, and wealth management, our three operating
businesses. So, it's complicated. It's a difficult valuation date, but it is the date that these assessments happen
every year, sometimes, more often but at a minimum.
What's somewhat interesting by this is at year-end, we had a market cap that was up another $1.2 billion to $1.3
billion from that point. If we were doing this at 12/31, it wouldn't be an issue, right? There wouldn't be the
possibility of an impairment charge. But we're dealing and working with our outside auditors and valuation team
that we work with, and we're doing it around the date that we have to. It's proven to be a difficult date for us.

Just wanted to touch on the margin. Your cost of total deposits continues to [ph] climb (00:57:28) lower. Do you
think that by the end of this year, you would fall below 20 basis points?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think that is possible. If we continue to see these, my word, massive inflows of deposits into our company,
and we're not obviously the only one who's experiencing that, then I think the industry needs to do what it can to
preserve margin. So, it's possible. We know what the role is on our CD book. That's the part of the book that
there's contractual pricing on. But there's a fair – there's a large differential between those CDs that are rolling off
in our current offering rate, and that's why that book is going down and the money is, because rates are so low,
just is going to non-interest-bearing accounts with us or money market rates even lower. There's a clear
preference for liquidity amongst customers. And because the industry is – this is an industry issue, there's really
very little opportunity for customers to go elsewhere for any rate pickup that's meaningful enough to make it
worthwhile. So, that's the long answer to – yes, I think that's possible.

modest charge to do that. So, I don't know the exact term structure of how much might come off this year. But
whatever it is, that's probably all the change will be and it will be relatively modest.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q

Got it. And if I could just squeeze one last one in, just on your NIM guidance, is that – that's not assuming a
further steepening in the yield curve?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Well, it's just based on current forewords. What I was trying to say is short rates are not going to move this year.
That's what the market's telling us. That's what the Fed is telling us. But we have seen a modest steepening of the
yield curve in the last, call it, two months. And I would say market expectation is for a little bit more steepening,
but it's relatively modest.

(01:01:53). But from a charge-off perspective, our experience this year is really on unique situations, most of them

time we've ever done that as a company. And normally, we're always comfortable with $10 million and we're
always within that range. We just spread at an extra $10 million from the perspective that things are getting better.
That's clear. Charge-offs, for us, for the last couple quarters, have been relatively low and steady. We've been
able to bring provision expense down. You've seen some banks start to release reserves. We've been a little
reluctant to do that yet. We think that will probably unfold. We hope that unfolds in 2021. But we just want to be
conservative in our view points at this point. And it's really CECL scenario-driven, which is another way of saying
it's economic forecast-driven.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Okay. And then, just going back to M&A, maybe – I was hoping you could provide some color on the
markets across your footprint that you want to be figuring, you want to be better in. If you're to stack order where
there was a target and you would take advantage of it, what are those markets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Well, I'm not ready to go there. You could look at our whole footprint and know that we're aware of it. And as
we've always said, we've – and we would kind of – we've always done, where we look across our markets for
opportunities to do win market deals and also look at markets adjacent.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then, just last one for me, with all the digital discussion, I just want to ask and get your thoughts
on the OCC letter from a couple weeks ago pertaining to blockchain, stablecoins for payments. Have you made
all these investments in digital technology? Is that something you've been pursuing? We don't hear a lot of
regional banks, certainly not a lot of community banks talking about this. And just curious what your thoughts
were there.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Yeah. We have not been pursuing it. Certainly, we pay attention like others on how that's all developing, but it's
not anything that we're working on.

Matthew Breese Q

Great. That's all I had. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from David Bishop with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is
now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jason Bishop Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Yeah. Thank you, gentlemen. Good evening.

Hi, David.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jason Bishop Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. [ph] I had a (01:05:34) question. You'd mentioned that you're expecting some benefit from the roll-off of CDs
at a higher rate to a lower rate. Just curious what that differential is in terms of offering yields on the CD portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Top of my head, Dave, I don't have the exact numbers. But I think that current differential is about 150 basis
points or so. It's quite significant. Our offering rates are dependent on term, probably only gets up to maybe 30 or
40 basis points.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jason Bishop Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Got it. And then, noted the strength, and I know it's been building across the year on the commercial lending fee
side in terms of fee income, just maybe some commentary in terms of the outlook for commercial banking fees
into 2021. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, thank you for recognizing. Even in a pandemic year, commercial banking lending fees were up.
There are some good news and bad news in there. I'd say the bad news is we did benefit from commercial real
estate, mostly payoff fees, right? We like the prepayment fee. We hate to lose the balance. So, that's the one
that's hard to call, and that's the good news/bad news piece that we – we experience that every year.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
The good news, when I think about commercial banking fees, is the – even in this year, we've seen nice
syndication fees out of our efforts to build those capabilities. We're leading more credit deals. We're earning
servicing fees on some of those deals, whether it's in our health care or our fund banking group or even our
mortgage warehouse group. So, the commercial fee activity and generation capabilities continue to get stronger.
Last year was a tough year for our interest rate swap business. We were down about $9 million in aggregate
year-over-year. And we're – we stand ready for every customer interest we have. It's just when origination
activities are subdued, those activities are also subdued. As soon as activity levels come back, we'll see a
resumption of those fees, and they aren't the type of fees that will come back strongly and quickly.
