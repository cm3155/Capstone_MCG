Kevin S. Blair
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2024 earnings call.
Our first quarter results demonstrate tangible progress on the strategic priorities that we have outlined for you
over the last several quarters. Synovus produced steady loan growth in key commercial categories such as
middle market, corporate and investment banking and specialty C&I, as well as continued rationalization in loan
portfolios where we have less meaningful deposit or fee relationships. We generated core deposit growth in a
seasonally weaker quarter and are seeing improving trends in non-interest-bearing deposit diminishment as well
as continued contraction in higher cost brokered deposits.
Core and non-interest revenue categories continue to grow on a year-over-year basis while operating expense
control remains disciplined, with investments in key areas continuing while keeping total expenses roughly flat.
Our quarterly loan losses remain stable and our balance sheet continues to strengthen, with further improvement
in key safety and soundness metrics, highlighted by lower wholesale funding and higher capital ratios. Our
financial success is a direct result of how well we are meeting the needs and expectations of our clients through
trusted advice and valued service.
In that regard, Synovus and our talented team members continue to be nationally recognized for service
excellence. We are extremely proud to report that Synovus recently received 25 Greenwich awards for our 2023
performance, serving small businesses and middle market clients. We earned the fourth highest number of total

awards among the over 500 banks that were evaluated. We also continue to perform very well against our
southeastern peers in the recently released J.D. Power survey for consumer client satisfaction and trust.
Our Grow the Bank initiative continued to gain traction in the first quarter as we finalized our new GreenSky
program, expanded our middle market banker team, built our largest CIB pipeline to-date, generated over 50 new
relationships from our Business Owner Wealth Strategy. Grew wealth AUM by 12% year-over-year, added a new
commodities hedging capability and expanded existing relationships with approximately 75% of our Treasury
sales to existing clients.
Speaking of our Treasury and Payment Solutions team, we are excited to introduce a differentiated new solution
called Accelerate Pay, which alleviates administrative burdens faced by accounts payable staff and seamlessly
integrates into existing workflows, providing an immediate return on investment for our clients. We launched this
new capability earlier this month and the pipeline has been building steadily since the announcement.
Lastly, we have a long successful track record in Community Banking. This quarter, our Community Bank
generated core deposit growth of almost $350 million and our Consumer Bank produced growth of approximately
$300 million. Our longstanding, well-positioned core businesses continue to drive growth through a value
relationship approach, allowing us to invest in new sources of revenue and future growth.
Now, let's move to slide 3 for the quarterly financial highlights. Synovus reported first quarter 2024 diluted EPS of
$0.78 and adjusted EPS of $0.79. However, a $13 million incremental FDIC Special Assessment reduced our
reported and adjusted first quarter EPS by $0.07, following a $51 million or $0.26 EPS impact from the initial
special assessment in the prior quarter. As previously mentioned, we generated healthy and consistent loan
growth in our high-priority commercial business lines, including middle market, corporate and investment banking
and specialty lending with these categories up 11% annualized.
However, period-end loan growth was flat in the first quarter due to flat line utilization, commercial real estate and
senior housing paydowns and payoffs and strategic loan portfolio rationalization efforts. Despite seasonal
headwinds, our core deposits grew modestly in the first quarter. The team remains highly focused on accelerating
core funding generation through sales activities and product expansion, which led to an increase in deposit
production of roughly $300 million versus the fourth quarter and at a rate that was approximately 8 basis points
lower. January's non-interest-bearing deposit decline was impacted by seasonality but deposit flows improved
throughout the course of the quarter, with a $299 million increase in the month of March. Given the strength of our
core deposit growth, we reduced brokered deposits for the third consecutive quarter.
Looking at non-interest revenue, we experienced year-over-year growth in key categories, including Treasury and
Payment Solutions and our Commercial Sponsorship lines of business. However, total adjusted non-interest
revenue declined modestly from a year ago, primarily driven by lower service charges and wealth management
income as a result of the 2023 consumer checking modifications and third quarter 2023 GLOBALT divestiture.
Also, capital markets income was lower relative to more elevated levels experienced in the first quarter of 2023
given the strong correlation to loan production. 2023 cost initiatives as well as ongoing diligence has led to flattish
overall core expense growth year-over-year while maintaining a level of strategic investments that positioned
Synovus well from a competitive standpoint in order to drive long-term shareholder value. On the asset quality
front, credit losses were stable with previous quarters.
Lastly, given continued economic uncertainty, we further bolstered our common equity tier 1 ratio in the first
quarter through solid earnings accretion and balance sheet management, while completing a measured amount

of opportunistic share repurchases. Common equity tier 1 levels are the highest in over eight years and currently
sits in the upper-half of our stated range of 10% to 10.5%.
Now, I'll turn it over to Jamie to cover the first quarter results in greater detail. Jamie?

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin. As you can see on slide 4, total loan balances were essentially stable on a linked quarter basis.
As expected, our loan growth was muted as key strategic business lines saw growth, which was offset by balance
sheet optimization efforts and transaction-related decline. Consistent with our focus on core client relationships,
growth in middle market, commercial, CIB and specialty lines was $287 million during the first quarter. There is
increased strength in the commercial real estate and senior housing markets, as evidenced by higher levels of
transaction activity over the last two quarters due to property sales and refinancing. We expect this increased
transaction activity to result in declines in these portfolios throughout 2024. We also continue to strategically
reduce our non-relationship syndicated lending and third-party consumer loan portfolios in the first quarter, further
positioning our balance sheet for core client growth.
Consistent with our overall balance sheet strategy, we continue to prioritize clients with meaningful deposit and
non-interest revenue relationships while rationalizing growth in credit-only lending areas such as syndicated
lending and third-party consumer lending that have a lower return profile or don't meet our strategic relationship
objective. Our organic balance sheet optimization efforts will continue as we focus on balanced loan and core
deposit growth.
Turning to slide 5, core deposit balances grew $165 million sequentially during the first quarter. The Community
Bank and the Consumer Bank saw strong growth, while seasonality contributed to a decline in deposits in the
Wholesale Bank. As we look to the remainder of the year, growth from the Wholesale Bank and continued
execution within our Consumer and Community segments should support core deposit growth within our
previously stated guidance range. Client demand for time deposits remained elevated during the first quarter.
This growth, combined with our continued remixing of non-interest-bearing deposits, pushed total deposit costs
higher during the quarter. We are encouraged by trends in non-interest-bearing bearing as the $601 million
decline in January was followed by a significantly less contraction in February and $299 million of growth in
March. Brokered deposits declined $324 million or 5% from the fourth quarter, which was the third consecutive
quarter of contraction. We expect further declines in brokered deposits in the coming quarters. As we look at
funding cost, the aforementioned trends resulted in our total cost of deposits increasing by 17 basis points to
2.67% in the first quarter. For the month of March, total deposit costs was 2.67% versus 2.53% in December. Our
cycle to-date total deposit beta in March was 49% versus 46% in December.
Moving to slide 6, net interest income was $419 million in the first quarter, which represented a decline of 4% from
the fourth quarter. The primary factors contributing to this decline included a lower day count, which impacted
spread revenue by approximately $4 million, a modest decline in loan balances and earning assets and further
cost increases within our core interest-bearing deposit portfolio. Deposit mix also impacted our margin for the
quarter. Though, as we mentioned, trends later in the first quarter were somewhat more constructive than the
averages for the quarter. Net interest margin ended the quarter at 3.04%, a sequential decline of 7 basis points as
the benefits of higher rates on newer production, fixed rate asset repricing and the partial securities repositioning
in the fourth quarter were more than offset by the core deposit mix trends and deposit cost increase. As we look
forward to the second quarter, we expect relative stability in the net interest margin.

Slide 7 shows total reported non-interest revenue of $119 million in the first quarter. Adjusted non-interest
revenue was $117 million and declined $10 million, or 8% from the previous quarter and was down $1 million or
1% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Commercial Sponsorship income declined by $5 million, primarily
related to a decline in back book-related GreenSky fees. We expect relatively stable quarterly Commercial
Sponsorship fees for the remainder of the year. BOLI revenue was also elevated in the fourth quarter, impacting
the quarter-over-quarter comparison. These declines were partially offset by higher mortgage, wealth
management and capital markets fees.
When looking at the year-ago quarter, core banking fees increased 5%, driven by Treasury and Payment
Solutions fee growth of approximately 8% as well as the impact of our second quarter 2023 Qualpay investment.
Also, other non-interest revenue increased sharply year-over-year, primarily from the expanded GreenSky
relationship. These tailwinds were offset as a result of the consumer checking modifications implemented last
year. Also, wealth management income was down year-over-year due to the GLOBALT divestiture in the third
quarter of 2023. Despite a slower first quarter for capital markets-related income, we expect capital markets
growth in 2024, led by our middle market and CIB business lines. We continue to invest in core non-interest
revenue streams that deepen client relationships such as Treasury and Payments Solutions, capital markets and
wealth management, which have demonstrated healthy growth over the past few years.
Moving to expense. Slide 8 highlights our operating cost discipline. Reported and adjusted non-interest expense
was impacted by a $13 million incremental FDIC Special Assessment. The total impact of the two special
assessments was $64 million, including the initial $51 million recognized in the fourth quarter. Reported non-
interest expense was $323 million and adjusted non-interest expense of $319 million was down $34 million, or
10% from the prior quarter. Adjusted non-interest expense increased $14 million, or 5% year-over-year, which
was almost entirely driven by the $13 million incremental FDIC Special Assessment incurred in the first quarter.
Employment expense was down 1% year-over-year, benefited by our head count reductions made over the past
three quarters. Seasonally higher employment expense inflated non-interest expense by approximately $11
million in the first quarter, which impacted earnings by an estimated $0.06. Importantly, we will remain proactive
with disciplined expense management in this revenue-challenged environment. As a result, adjusted non-interest
expense should be relatively flat in 2024, excluding the FDIC Special Assessments imposed in the fourth quarter
2023 and the first quarter 2024.
Moving to slides 9 and 10 on credit quality. Our allowance for credit losses ended the first quarter at $546 million
or 1.26%, up from $537 million or 1.24% in the fourth quarter. Consistent with the prior quarters, we continue to
raise the allowance to reflect asset valuations, credit migration trends and a heavier weighting toward downside
economic scenario. Net charge-offs in the first quarter were $44 million or 41 basis points, compared to 38 basis
points in the fourth quarter and 40 basis points in the third quarter, which excluded the loan sales.
The non-performing loan ratio increased to 0.81% of loans as credit metrics migrate from historically low levels.
Total criticized and classified credits rose slightly but remain at very manageable levels. First quarter net charge-
offs and credit metrics were impacted by one particular commercial and industrial credit, which accounted for 17
basis points of net charge-offs and is expected to be resolved later this month. We have a high degree of
confidence in the strength and quality of our loan portfolio and we will continue to reduce our non-relationship
credits and manage the portfolio with a heightened level of diligence in this more uncertain macroeconomic
environment.
As seen on slide 11, our capital position continued to increase in the first quarter with the preliminary common
equity Tier 1 ratio reaching 10.38% and with total risk-based capital now at 13.31%. Retained earnings supported

capital accretion in the first quarter. Additionally, our efforts to rationalize growth within certain segments resulted
in a modest decline in risk-weighted assets, which further supported the increase in our capital ratios. Against this
backdrop, we executed about $30 million of common stock repurchases in the first quarter, which equates to
approximately 6 basis points of capital. We will continue to target a CET1 ratio within a range of 10.0% and 10.5%
and aim to maintain a robust capital position against what remains an uncertain macroeconomic environment.
Looking into the second quarter, we would note that our risk-weighted asset optimization is currently underway
that is expected to result in a subset of our loan portfolio being eligible for a reduced risk weighting. When
completed, this should support our capital ratios and provide flexibility for incremental capital deployment. This
incremental capital deployment is contingent upon the analysis and documentation of the eligibility of certain loan
portfolios for reduced risk weighting. We will share further details on the results of this exercise over the near
term.
Finally, on April 1, we reclassified $3.4 billion of our securities portfolio from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity.
This reclassification will reduce the interest rate sensitivity within AOCI and thus the variability of our tangible
common equity ratio.
I'll now turn it back to Kevin to discuss our 2024 guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jamie. I'll now continue with our updated fundamental guidance for the remainder of 2024. Based on
first quarter experience and our existing pipelines, period-end loan growth is still expected to be 0% to 3% in
2024. Growth should be supported by the continued success in middle market, corporate and investment banking
and specialty lines, offset by rationalization in non-relationship credits and commercial real estate and senior
housing payoff and paydown activity. Our current forecast for core deposits indicates growth within a 2% to 6%
range for the year, aided by seasonal tailwinds as the year progresses and new core funding growth initiatives.
With the last FOMC rate increase now having occurred roughly nine months ago, we believe deposit costs are in
the process of stabilizing and with some residual upward pressure remaining into the second quarter, should
result in a peak total deposit beta for the cycle between 49% and 50%.
Under this forecast for deposit cost, our current outlook points to the revenue growth at the low-end of our
negative 3% to 1% range, largely impacted by the continued deposit remixing that we and the industry are
experiencing. Our forecast is based upon a stable interest rate environment and does not include any potential
benefits from the ongoing risk-weighted asset optimization exercise. Net interest income should improve in the
second-half of this year, as fixed rate asset repricing overcomes deposit repricing and remixing. Non-interest
revenues should experience growth this year as pipelines for capital markets-related fees remain strong. We
continue to execute on our core growth and Treasury and Payment Solutions and the new GreenSky forward-flow
program continues to build.
Our adjusted non-interest expense growth guidance is unchanged after adjusting for the impact of the first quarter
FDIC Special Assessment. Excluding the special assessments in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of
2024, we anticipate our adjusted non-interest expense will be relatively stable this year. We continue to closely
monitor and manage our loan portfolio to uncover any credit deterioration or systemic themes across industry and
geography. We expect the first-half of the year net charge-offs to continue to be relatively stable at approximately
40 basis points. Given current credit migration trends, assuming a relatively stable economic environment and
considering the impact of certain large individual losses, we expect net charge-offs to be flat to down in the
second-half of the year.

Moving to the tax rate, our current forecast points to the upper-half of our 21% to 22% range. Finally, our common
equity Tier 1 ratio is at the high-end of our target range of 10% to 10.5%. And we will remain opportunistic with
measured amounts of share repurchases to manage capital levels. Prudent capital management remains our top
priority to ensure we have strong and liquid balance sheet for all economic environments.
Through the actions we have taken over the past several quarters, Synovus is well-positioned to meet the needs
of our clients while operating from a position of strength amid this evolving economic landscape. We are focused
on growing the bank through the expansion of relationships and the delivery of new sources of revenue, all while
improving returns and building an even more risk-resilient bank.
And now, operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. Let's open the call for questions.

Hey. Kevin, if I can try to get you off-script a little bit if I can. Stocks off a little bit this morning. I would say it's been
a battleground in terms of feedback. And I think the quarter looks okay to me, maybe soft in a couple of areas,
fine in others, some positive trends also emerging. But curious how you see it, maybe a chance to defend your
stock a little bit. How do you see the puts-and-takes of the quarter? Where do you think you need to do better?
What do you think is going well? Just curious on your thoughts to start the call?

Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Jon. Look, I love the question because I think that's what's on my mind. You look at a lot of the information
we provided today, it really comes down to two areas; margin and credit. Because when you look at our expenses
and you look at fee income, I think we continue to meet and exceed our expectations there.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
So, let's dig in a little bit first on margin. We're off 7 basis points this quarter and that is largely a function of
deposits and that was higher than what we had modeled. So, when you look at what caused it, it was fairly evenly
split between our non-interest bearing decline, our interest-bearing, non-maturity deposit cost increases and a
little more CD remixing. And I don't want to get into the weeds around each of those because we could spend the
rest of the call. But I expect those trends to improve. And as we look at some of the things that we've already
done, as well as some of the trends that we've seen this quarter, which would include some positive trends
around DDA, I think those headwinds on the margins will abate.
And as Jamie said in the prepared remarks, we would expect this quarter to be flat. And then as you'll hear later,
there are some things that we have in place, both from the fixed asset repricing but also some of these trends
changing that will allow us to expand our margin by 10 to 15 basis points by year-end, getting us right back to the
3.20% that we shared back in January. And that obviously assumes flat rates. That does not include any impact
of any of the potential use of any capital that we would realize as part of this risk-weighted asset optimization
exercise. So, quarter was down, more contraction than we thought. I think we have a path to expansion and one
that's very similar to what we talked about back in January.
Now, on to the credit front. We had stable net charge-offs this quarter, including one very large credit that has
since been resolved. And that credit really impacted our credit metrics this quarter, 17 basis points of our charge-
offs and it also represented 18 basis points of our increase in NPLs. Having resolved this credit this month that
will ultimately result in a commensurate decline in NPLs, meaning that without that credit, NPLs would have
actually declined this quarter.
And maybe what's most important is what I just said there at the end, which was we expect our net charge-offs to
be flat to down in the second-half of the year based upon our portfolio metrics and trends. Now, some have
probably questioned how can that be, given some of the metrics. Well, one of the things that we did this quarter,
we initiated a deep dive through our entire multifamily portfolio. Very similar to what we did last year in office and
similar to what we did with the hospitality industry back in COVID. And that led to a downgrade of four credits,
which totaled right around $96 million. So, that deep dive represented 22 of the 25 basis point increase in our
criticized and classified ratio.
Also on the provision front, given what we've seen on valuation across all asset classes, this quarter we added a
qualitative adjustment to the allowance of just under $30 million to account for higher loss given default if we were
to see any sort of defaults on the CRE side. Without that adjustment, our allowance would have actually declined
quarter-on-quarter. And I'll just remind you that our CRE portfolio continues to perform very well. We have an NPL
ratio of 13 basis points and we only had $2 million of NPL inflows this quarter.
So, when I look at everything in totality and I think about the two areas that probably had some softness to your
point, I look at the stability and improvement in those areas. And when I couple that with our expense discipline
and our increased forecast for fee income and then you add, on top of that, the potential to have incremental
capital from our risk-weighted asset optimization, I feel like our opportunities in the forecast outweigh those of the
risk.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. Yeah. Those are the issues. It's credit and margin, so appreciate that, Kevin. And then just to follow-
up quickly Jamie for you. Kevin just mentioned it but what do you need to do for the RWA optimization efforts?
Who needs to bless it, when could it happen and how much capital do you think it could free up? Thank you.

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Jon, thanks for the question. Hey – look, you're aware, we've been working on improving our ROE for
multiple years and recently we put a lot of effort into our review of what is consuming our risk-weighted assets.
We've been looking at real estate line, C&I, unfunded commitments and general kind of return for every dollar of
risk-weighted assets that we put on the books. Some of these strategies affect our go-to-market strategy. Some of
them affect what we do as far as our inorganic strategies, like the sale of business lines that we did in 2023. But
the effort we're talking about today is around certain loan categories that could be eligible to have reduced risk
weighting, including mortgage, government lending, securitization exposures and multi-family term loans. The
largest impact of this effort is coming from loans that qualify for a reduced RWA treatment within our lender
finance portfolio. But in order to achieve that risk weighting down to 20%, in many cases relative to the 100% risk
weighting we have today, we have to perform proper analysis and documentation in light of the regulatory capital
requirements under the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach. And, unfortunately, we haven't completed that
effort so we cannot give specific details on the impact of capital ratios. But as we said in the prepared remarks, as
we show in the deck, we believe it could be meaningful. Given what we have completed to-date, we think the
impact could be $1 billion or more reduction to risk-weighted assets and the impact to cap ratios could be greater
than 20 basis points.
So, if we successfully complete this work and given where we are with capital, we're already at the higher end of
our range. And that's our intent, is to stay at the higher end of our target range. And so we'll likely deploy this
capital, any capital generated from this when it's completed to either securities repositioning or share repurchases
and kind of try to maintain our capital ratios at the given level. We say – you asked about what could this be? And
we feel confident about the $1 billion or more comment. The upside is probably around $2 billion. And so we have
work to do but we do expect to complete it in the near term and we'll report back once we get further along.

Yeah. So, I guess just following up on NII and the NIM outlook. So, you always had this expectation around no
rate cuts in your guidance. So, I'm trying to think through around what's changed versus what's not changed. Can
you talk about the pricing competition in your markets like we had one of your peers reported yesterday talked
about a significant pickup in pricing competition on deposits in the southeast markets. Are you seeing the same
thing and just the level of visibility around NIB mix and the peak deposit beta that you called out in the slide deck?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Ebrahim, as we talked about in the past, I don't think the pricing competition is going to abate. I mean everyone's
in the market for liquidity, and as an industry we traditionally use price to attract new deposits and so we haven't
seen a big change there. We also haven't seen any of the competitive data to suggest that rates are going higher.
As a matter of fact, when we look at our production this quarter for new deposits, we actually declined about 8
basis points. And so we've kept our rates roughly the same and that has left us in a competitive position, roughly
in the same place. Our production was up about 12% quarter-on-quarter. So, I wouldn't suggest to you that
there's a big change in the competitive landscape. I think it's always very competitive and we're looking for ways
to position ourselves not just with rate but other ways to win new deposits. But I haven't really seen a big change
in the pricing backdrop.
Jamie, do you want talk a little about NIB and how we think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ebrahim, let me just speak to the first quarter going to the second quarter because this is the inflection
point, right? We had 17 basis points of deposit cost increase in the first quarter. And obviously, given our margin
outlook, we expect that to abate in the second quarter. So, let's kind of go through the components. And in the
first quarter, the driver of margin compression on the liability side was NIB declines and then increased interest-
bearing cost. And when you think about those individually. For non-interest-bearing deposits, as we showed on
slide 5, the trends there are positive and we had a January where we saw a large amount of attrition in that
portfolio. But then we saw stabilization in February and growth in March and we expect the stabilization to
continue in NIB given the change in trends. Now, to be clear, we expect NIB as a percent of total deposits to
decline as we head through year-end. But we think that that pressure will be much more moderate than what we
saw early in the year.
When you think about interest-bearing deposits, the pressure on the first quarter call was driven by increases in
each category of NOW, money market and CDs. When you look at the non-maturity deposits, on money market
deposits, the average rate of money markets for us has been flat since December. When you look at the NOW
account, the average rate of NOW accounts has been flat since January. So, we're seeing stability in these
portfolios. NOW, time deposits do continue to creep up due to production being higher than the rolling-off rate of
time deposits and the growth in the portfolio. But what I'd say about that is when you look at the second quarter,
we have $2.4 billion of maturities in time deposits and our new and renewed rate on time deposits in the first
quarter was right at 2.5% – I mean, 4.5%. So, we have $2.4 billion maturing at 4.4% and are going on, new
production in the first quarter for new and renewed is 4.5%. So very similar.
So, that's just going to – we expect that to be reduced pressure going forward to the cost of interest-bearing
deposits. And so, combination of all of those things on the liability side, along with a normalization of loan fees,
less interest reversal and the residual benefit of the first quarter hedge maturities give us confidence in the
second quarter margin, which is the launching point for margin expansion in the second-half of the year.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's great color. So, thank you for walking through all of that. And just separately on credit also. So, we build
reserves. Has your macro view changed in terms of what you're seeing in the markets today for the economy, for
the credit book today versus back in Jan? Or is this result based essentially just putting aside some money, being
conservative? I'm trying to get a sense of are you seeing signs within the portfolio that imply a little bit more
worsening than you expected a few months ago?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Ebrahim. No. No, we are not. And matter of fact, when you think about the general macro economy, we're actually
seeing general improvement in the outlook there. And you can see that in our waterfall and the change in the
allowance, you can see that that pushed towards a reduction in the allowance this quarter. And as Kevin
mentioned earlier, the performance was really the deep dive we did on multi-family.
Now, just to be clear, as he mentioned, we haven't seen a degradation in the quality of that portfolio. But what we
have done is just increased the allowance based on what we're seeing out there with valuations, with office
occupancy just out of prudence. And so the allowance increase you see is based on that. You'll see an increase
in the allowance associated with CRE due to that move. We have increased the allowance to loan ratio in CRE
about 14 basis points in this quarter. And so – but again that's indicative of the environment more than the
performance of the portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just on that multi-family deep dive, we downgraded four loans. Anything else? I mean, there's
obviously a lot of chatter about supply coming on over the next year or two. So, I'm assuming you kind of worked
through that. And the four loans that you downgraded is all you kind of identified as having any signs of
weakness?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Ebrahim, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. Yeah. Just as Kevin mentioned, those four credits were
downgraded to what we would classify as a special mention status just based on interest rate stress as it relates
to coverage. We have great sponsors there. We don't see really any significant loss content, more just getting –
making sure we had the classification right. And again it was just four multi-family loans that moved to special
mention but nothing changed in terms of our outlook for any kind of loss content relative to multi-family. And we
still feel like, yes, there's some supply issues in pockets, in certain markets. But again from our perspective,
there's a lot of equity in these projects. Rent increases have been going strong for a few years. They're settling
now and actually retracting a little bit. But there's a fair amount of cushion in these projects and certainly the
demand is still there relative to housing – single-family housing constraints.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Ebrahim, I'll just reference slide 23 in the appendix where we give you a little more detail on the entire multi-
family portfolio, including the fact that 11% of it is student housing. Again, very low LTV, performing at a very high
level, NPL ratios of only 5 basis points. So, the deep dive, as Bob said, we've done in other asset classes just to

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I wanted to start – so, looking at the 2024 outlook slide, it's based on flat rates from current levels. And I'm
curious, I know the forward curve is changing by the minute. But assuming the current one does play out and we
did get two cuts or something in that range. Do you still think we would see this NIM expansion, 10 to 15 bps in
the second-half of the year? And are you still in this adjusted revenue growth range if we do get those cuts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, the simple answer to that is, and to your point, the forward curve changes all the time, which is why
we gave our guidance to flat rates, why we did it in January as well.
But when we look out there, what we would say is during an easing cycle, we do expect to see margin pressure.
We remain relatively neutral to the front of the curve. So, we do expect once deposit cost stabilize to be at a
similar spot when we come out of the easing cycle as we were going in. But during the cycle, we would expect
somewhere between 6 and 12 basis points impact to the margin. But, with the forward curve, to your question on
the full-year revenue, we think that the forward curve, given where it is today, would be less than 1% impact on
revenue for 2024.

[ph] It won't come out (00:40:31). Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then Kevin, I had a big picture question. So, I loved
reading your annual report where you talked about this Grow the Bank mantra, right, in the Shareholder Letter.
Again, when I look at this year, I get why expenses are flat because the revenue environment is pretty tough. But
when I looked in your markets, right, I mean, most banks would be very envious of your markets. How do you
think about this balance of investing enough to really take advantage of the growth potential in your markets? And
as the environment improves, do we expect this pace of investments to improve? Because, honestly, your loan
growth is not much different than banks that really have a much worse footprint than you have. Just wondering
when do we start to see Synovus deliver growth that's really commensurate with the great markets that you're in?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Look, Steven, it's the question that we wrestle with every day in terms of investments, is how much do you spend
today for long-term shareholder value? And we are leaning in. Behind the scenes, we're at zero for this year but
we're still adding team members in our commercial area, our private wealth area. We're investing in technology.
And you never spend enough. You always want to spend a little more. We take a very financial approach to how
we look at investments in terms of earn-back period. And whether that's adding a new resource or adding a
technology, we look at how long it takes for that investment to pay back and we continue to keep a very regiment
approach to doing that.
But as revenue grows, we're going to increase the level of spend. We want to make sure – positive operating
leverage for us is less about something we're trying to do. I just think it's good stewardship for shareholders. We
want to invest as much as we can as presented by the revenue growth that we have. So, yes, as revenue
improves in 2025 and 2026, you'll see us invest more. And I couldn't agree with you more. We have a real
opportunity in the southeast, not just because of the demographic shifts. But as we've said, you look at our J.D.
Power survey, you look at our Greenwich survey, our clients tell us that we serve them better than our
competitors. And in that case, we should not only get the benefit of the growth of the southeast but we should get
higher market share growth by taking clients from our competitors.
So, yes, we want to continue to invest prudently. We do use revenue growth as a calibrator on how much we're
willing to spend as margin starts to expand, as the economy provides us more growth, we'll spend more money.
And lastly, just on the loan growth side, I think in our loan slide, you'll see that the areas that we continue to invest
in, we are growing. We are up 11% annualized in middle market, CIB and specialty. But because we've been
rightsizing the balance sheet, we've been downplaying our Shared National Credits as well as senior housing,
which has had a fairly big headwind on loan growth. And we've seen some more constructive activity on CRE that
allows us to see some payoff activities that we haven't seen for some time.
So, as we get to a more normalized level on Shared National Credits and senior housing and we get our pipeline
start to build again on CRE. When you add in the strategic growth, you're going to see that loan growth go back to
levels that are far higher than they are today and ones that I think you would point to as being higher growth.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Kevin, you talked last quarter about a PPNR growth rate from fourth quarter 2023 to fourth quarter 2024 of being
about 8% to 10%. And as we think about, your revised guidance, kind of the lower end of the revenue range. It
feels like NII is inflecting but a little softer. Is there enough in what you're seeing in fees and expenses to still get
to that 8% to 10% PPNR rate? Or is the NIM and rate environment eating into that a little bit to where that high
single-digit growth rate is really going to be more of a 2025 event?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
This decline in margin this quarter kind of delays that sort of high single-digit PPNR growth maybe into 2025 a
little bit based on this forecast. But as Jamie said, we have a lot of levers we're working on right now that would
allow us to potentially increase our forecast on the revenue front. And we're going to keep the expenses where
they were forecasted originally.
So, give us some more time as we work through this year. But, to your point, based on this 7 basis point decline
this quarter in margin, it would delay that sort of quarter-over-quarter increase in fourth quarter, and to your point,
maybe into 2025. But we'll continue to update this forecast as we get to the conclusion of the risk-weighted asset
optimization program.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's helpful. It makes sense. And then as we think about [indiscernible] (00:45:49) higher-for-longer
environment, you've given great disclosure and discussion Jamie about the difference in the margin once we start
to see rate cuts, that 6 to 12 basis points that you talk about. How do you think about what growth, how growth
changes when we start to get cut? Your guide is 0 to 3% without cuts. But is it fair to say that when we start to get
cuts that growth could actually start to accelerate? And then if we're kind of higher-for-longer, will we stay at the

low-end of that growth range? Just kind of curious about the dynamics between growth and margin in the rate
environment. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
We do believe that easing would be stimulative to growth on the loan book. We also believe – I mean, when you
look at our client profile, a marginal rate cut or a marginal rate hike does not have – it does not have a
tremendous impact on the credit outlook of our clients. Like when we look at the credit impact of easing and
tightening, we think that our – kind of our FDM disclosures are a good indication of the rate impact there and only
30% of those have any sort of rate component to the modification.
And so we don't think there's a big credit impact. But there's also, in an easing environment, there are positives to
fee revenue. And so we believe that it will be a net positive, to your point on the loan side to loan production but
also to capital markets fees, to mortgage fees, core banking fees. And so there are – when you look across the
income statement, we think it will be positive to loan growth. We think it could ease deposit mix pressures and we
think it will be positive to fee revenue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That makes sense. So, [ph] with fee (00:47:43), I think we focus so much on just the margin, right, in the higher-
for-longer versus the environment [ph] when we see (00:47:48) rate cut. But it feels like there's enough with all
that you lay out. And that's really why you're kind of thinking about only a less than 1% change in NII if we start to
get cuts in the back-half of the year along the forward curve.

...on credit. Just that – good morning. Just that large C&I credit that you called out a few times. Could you be any
more specific in terms of kind of industry and maybe the issues surrounding that particular credit? Was it a longer-
term struggling company or maybe just some color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Gary. It's Bob. Thanks for the question. It's an aviation credit, South Florida sort of bankruptcy working
through. We were a co – senior lender with another lender involved in subordinated debt behind us. Worked
through the bankruptcy as a going concern sale. That option didn't materialize as well as we thought it would. We
increased reserves on the credit. We actually had to credit fairly well reserved. And when we took the charge-off,
it was pretty much equal to the reserve amount.
So, we think we managed it the right way. It was, from our perspective, it had good equity in it. But for a number
of specific factors that I really won't get into in the bankruptcy. But nonetheless the best option was to get it
refinanced and sold through an asset sale. That's exactly what happened. And we ended up taking the charge
and getting it resolved. So, does that help?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. It does. Appreciate that. And then just in terms of the expectation Jamie for a flat NIM in the second
quarter. Given the commentary about the trends in the first quarter, I think the cost of deposits in March was
essentially flat to the quarter and you flagged pricing on NOW accounts and money markets has been pretty flat.
So, other than some additional mix potentially and a small amount of upward push on CD based on the kind of
repricing of those, it feels like the flattening even is a little bit conservative. Am I missing something as I'm
interpreting your comments on the NIM?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Your comments on the deposit side and the funding calls are spot on. And that's what we see as we see a little bit
of pressure due to NIB declines ongoing. NOW, we haven't seen anything in April that would turn us from that
impact. April has been constructive to-date. We would expect to see a little bit of pressure on time deposits. But
as I mentioned, the maturities are at a similar rate as our new and renewed production rate. So, that's where we
are on the deposit side. And we do expect to see stability, as I said, on the non-maturity, interest-bearing
deposits.
And then when you look at the first quarter margin, it was also impacted by loan fees being lower than typical. It's
impacted by interest reversals. And we think that those are more of a first quarter event and will not be continued.
And so there are tailwinds there to the margin. But, for now, our guidance is for flat in the second quarter. But
those are the individual components as we see them.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everybody.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Maybe just following up on the question Steve was asking about the market. When you strip out some of the
noise from portfolios that you're exiting, would you say you're being successful in attracting new-to-the-bank
customers right now? Or is most of that core growth coming from existing customers? And can you comment I
guess a little bit on the competitive market with maybe some of the bigger peers? Are they still losing customers
overall or do you feel like they're maybe doing a little better job or recently retaining those commercial customers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Absolutely. Not only winning customers, we start with winning talent. And so you look at those areas that
we highlight as strategic growth initiatives. Middle market, over the last three years, we've increased our bankers
by roughly 50% and those bankers are continuing to win new business. Business from the institutions they've
come from as well as just prospecting efforts. And so the growth in middle market, both on the loan and deposit
side, is coming from that new talent and from new clients. On the CIB front, we have 24 FTEs. We're up to right
around $725 million in loan outstandings, another $50 million of growth this quarter, six new clients we have
onboarded this year and so that's coming from brand-new relationships and expanding existing relationships. Our
specialty lending area, both for our lender finance as well as our restaurant services, again new clients expanding
the existing relationships.
So, in every situation, not only are we winning talent, we are winning the competitive war of taking clients from
other folks. So that's the game. As I said earlier we have a great marketplace, but if you think rising tides raise all
boats, then you're missing an opportunity. We want to get more than our fair share of growth and we're doing that
in those areas. Offsetting that are areas that we're running down credit, and that doesn't mean that we're losing
clients in many situations. We're just deemphasizing growth in those areas and letting certain loans to payoff and
paydown.
So, we are super excited. The competitive landscape with the big banks, to your point, there's always
opportunities. Anytime there's a merger, there continues to be some personnel changes that occur, which allow
us to go out and get more talent in these marketplaces. We've been adding it in all of our metro markets and
really across all of our footprint. And, look, you go back to the FDIC data last year to talk about this. We grew
market share in the state of Georgia by 100 basis points. In the MSA of Atlanta, 150 basis points. And so, for me,
that's the real message, is we've got to get talent. We've got to grow at a pace that meets our shareholders'
expectations. But most importantly, we've got to take share from our competitors.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. That's great color. Thanks. And then maybe shifting just a little bit. I'm looking at slides 22 and 23 and
looking at the maturity schedules of office and multi-family over the next two years. What's the expectation with
those maturities? Is your appetite to try to retain those, if possible, or what's the – I guess health of those loans
being able to be taken out somewhere else away from the bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Jared. It's Bob. Just to start on that and Jamie can touch on it as well. But certainly our first and
foremost priority is to work with our clients. Again, to Kevin's point, if it is a relationship client, somebody that
we're doing business with and the loan matures and we're going to work to retain that client, and that's our first
priority. Now, if it's a non-relationship transactional piece of business and we don't have much of that but we do
have some. And as Kevin mentioned in his comments around remixing the balance sheet a little bit, we may
choose to exit or get that refinanced. But it really comes down to client selection. We think we've got good clients
that can move through these maturities. We've certainly done a lot of analysis on what does the rate environment
look like and what the capital markets look like relative to maturities, stress testing, cap rates, et cetera. So, we
feel okay about our ability to move through our maturity schedule without what I would consider to be significant
credit events. Now, though, there will always be some stress there but we feel good about it, particularly as it
relates to multi-family. Office, maybe to your point, would be a little more stressed relative to valuations because
that's kind of where we are in the cycle. But from our perspective, we have – a little over 10% of our office book is
currently rated and that book has been analyzed enormously and we're sitting at around 10% and that's relatively
stable to last quarter. And six loans in there make up a majority of that number.
So, assuming that we can kind of work through those six and we don't backfill, we can kind of get through the
office maturity wall as well. So, we're feeling pretty confident about our ability to manage through it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Bob, the only thing I'd add to that is that when you think about each asset class, they're a little different. But
almost 35% of our multi-family is in construction. So, when those are completed, they'll go on to permanent
financing. We're not generally a long-term permanent financier for those. And so there'll be a kind of a natural
churn. And what we've seen the last two quarters is a fairly healthy level of payoff and paydown activities, both
from sales, as well as just refinancing through some of the agencies.
And so I think the important part is, to Bob's point, we're going to keep the clients we want to keep and those
asset classes that we want to continue to lend into, those that will go into more permanent financing, the markets
are opening up and it's going to be a much more constructive environment. And then we'll be able to backfill those
with new construction projects and new CRE developments behind that.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Jamie, I was just hopeful that on slide 16, you can
give us some color around your beta assumptions on the way down and maybe how you arrived at some of those,
that'd be helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Michael. As we think about betas, this is actually pretty similar to what we discussed a few months ago is
when you look at our portfolio. And this is why we included that slide to really give some clarity, at a high level, of
how do we think about repricing deposits in an easing environment. And so you have – obviously, you have a
portion of the portfolio that's non-interest bearing. Then you have a portion of the portfolio that's really high beta
and it's a little more systematic and those are time and brokered. And we do expect to see those – brokered
deposits will reprice at a very high beta. Same with time. Time would just be dependent on the maturities.
But then you get into the half of the portfolio, half the deposit book that is either standard and low beta or high
beta. And so the standard and lower beta is around 30% of the portfolio. Those are easier to reprice because
they're largely standard rates but their rates didn't go up as much in a tightening cycle, so we don't expect them to
go down as much in the easing cycle. That's why we have the lower beta there. And then on the exceptions and
higher beta, 20% of the deposit book, those we do expect to see decline at a higher beta. You can see our
assumptions on the slide but those will take – those take conversations in some part that will likely be a little bit
slower to reprice.
Now, we have plans for all of this. So, the timing is really up to us. It depends on the environment, it depends on
the competitive landscape. There are a lot of different factors that will go into it. But that's how we have it set up.
We're ready to go, even though it looks like the timing of it continues to get delayed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Very helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up from a kind of a regulatory aspect. I think there's some fear that
some of the bigger bank rules after what happened with NYCB could get pushed down to banks sub-$100 billion.
Can you just kind of talk about kind of what the CET1 ratio kind of looks like when including kind of the AOCI
impacts no matter what some of the larger banks are kind of contemplating at this point? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. On the capital, when we look at that, our CET1, inclusive of AOCI is 8.2% and we feel fine about that. As
we look at our capital ratios, including AOCI, we think that they're manageable. We think the AOCI accretion will
happen over time. We believe about 30% of the AOCI will accrete back in over – by the end of next year. So,
that's where we currently stand.
And on capital ratios, we mentioned this risk-weighted asset work that is expected to improve capital ratios. But
it's interesting. We haven't determined exactly what we would do when we get to the finish line on this. But it's an
interesting question when you take into context the CET1 inclusive of AOCI like the Cat IV banks because
securities repositioning would not necessarily impact that because it's already in your capital ratios.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. I guess I was curious Kevin, you mentioned deposits probably
were pressured a little bit more than you had expected. Can you talk about was that certain segments, certain
geographies, rural versus maybe wholesale or like kind of what the moving parts of that incremental pressure
was? Or is it more about that mix away from non-interest-bearing still? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, it's both. I mean, the mix away from non-interest-bearing is the first thing. But then when you look at the
primary reason that we're seeing increased expenses or increased rates, it's on the CD front. And so, part of it
has been just as more balances move into CDs, the actual remixing, the impact that that rate on that portfolio has
on the overall portfolio is the bigger issue. As Jamie mentioned, when we look at the individual categories like
money market and NOW, those rates have actually peaked, and in some cases, ticked down a basis point or two.
So, it has really more to do with just the remixing into CDs and those rates, as the question earlier, have stayed
very high in the competitive landscape, so we've had to keep our rates higher as well. We have tried to shorten
the duration there. Our odd-terms rate is five months, so we're going to have the opportunity if rates were to
decline to reprice those deposits much more quickly than if they were 13 months. But it's really more due to the
remixing that's happening there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Stephen, let me give you one more data point. As you look kind of one layer deeper, a lot of the deposit
outflows that we saw in the first quarter were with our larger clients. But when you look within the Community
Bank, which you can think about those as being our core clients. We saw growth, significant growth in
transactional deposits. And so on NOW accounts in the Community Bank, they were up 11% quarter-on-quarter.
If you look at money market accounts, they were up 3% quarter-on-quarter. So, that's strong growth with our core
clients. And those are the type of trends that we want to lean into and help fee as we go through 2024.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Wilczynski Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Brian Wilczynski filling in for Manan. I was wondering if you could talk about, going back
to credit, the breakdown of your non-performing loan balances with C&I, aside from that one credit that you
charged off this quarter. I asked because a few of your peers have cited weaker C&I this quarter. And I'm
wondering if there are any broad themes you're seeing from an industry perspective?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Brian. It's Bob. I would say no broad themes. Certainly, if you look at our non-accrual ratio and I'll set
the one credit aside just for this discussion, so would drop us down to around $280 million, give-or-take, of non-
accruals. About 70% of that is C&I. So – but no specific industries in there. Most of those C&I credits have either
specific reserves on them or we've already marked those credits to where we think is appropriate and the exit is in
process.
So, yes, the non-accrual portfolio would be more heavily weighted to C&I today. But, from our perspective, it's a
manageable number of credits. We have 13 credits above $5 million and we can put a pretty good pencil on a
number of those as it relates to resolution plan. So, when you start [ph] wheeling (01:06:31) it down, it is C&I
heavy but we think we got a very quantifiable number. And more importantly, what we see in terms of new inflows
is very light.
So, we think the C&I piece is going to be – continue to be a little more idiosyncratic. There's going to be some.
But that's the way we think about the corporate space. And then when you look at sort the other components of
our overall rated portfolio, we've got a senior housing component in there because it's been through the pandemic
and the labor cost increases. It's beginning to stabilize. So, that would be more of a positive.

And then, finally, it would be CRE, would be the third piece and that's specifically related to office. And as I
mentioned earlier, I think we're around 10% of our office portfolio is rated. And when we drill into those numbers,
as Kevin mentioned, the deep dives there that we've done on office and multi-family don't give us any significant
concern about just a backlog of new potential problems. So, as we work through those office loans, that will take
time. And that framework of those kind of categories is what's kind of guarding our charge-off guide, as Kevin
mentioned earlier, that we think we can begin to see improved charge-off numbers toward the back of the year,
certainly into 2025, assuming that we kind of remain in a rate environment, an economic environment that we're in
and that we don't see really any surprises. But our analysis doesn't reveal that today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Wilczynski Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I appreciate the color. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, I was wondering if you could unpack your rate
sensitivity to the long-end of the curve? Do you get a material benefit from the increase in the 10-year yield that
we have seen over the past few weeks? And, if so, how do you see that playing out through the end of 2024?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
We continue to be asset-sensitive to the long-end of the curve. So, the increase in rates is beneficial to us. It's
similar conversations that we've had before where when you roll-forward from the December conference to the
January earnings announcement, we spoke to a 5-basis-point difference in the margin expectation in the fourth
quarter due to the change in rates. That's a good indication of that asset sensitivity to the long-end of the curve
and it's approximately 2%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Wilczynski Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And is that primarily from – I would imagine that's primarily from fixed rate loan repricing. Do you have any
color on how much is coming due over the next three quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, on the securities portfolio, we have about $60 million a month in paydowns. And so that's just steady flow,
steady repricing. You see our book yield on the securities portfolio. That's part of that accretion. And then we have
about a $5 billion mortgage portfolio that that is paying down at about 10% a year.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe can we get an update on what you expect the cadence of brokered deposits declines to look like
throughout the course of the year. And then, as we look at broader time deposit growth, just your appetite there?
It seems like there's some ability for the balance sheet maybe to use some balance sheet liquidity and maybe not
grow time deposits as fast as they've been growing. Maybe just give us your thoughts about just the 85% loan-to-
deposit or the cadence of brokered deposit paydowns and then your appetite for time deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Timur, great questions. On brokered, we do expect to see those continue to decline as we go through the
year. It's safe to use $250 million to $500 million per quarter for that. On time deposits, you're exactly right. First, if
you look at Wholesale funding, we're down over 30% in Wholesale funding year-over-year. And so that gives a lot
of flexibility on the liquidity side to choose the most economical way to fund the bank.
Now, with regards to time deposit, part of that is client demand. And so we have to react to where clients are on
what they're looking for on their deposits. And there's a lot of attraction to time deposits. And so we need to be
there for them with a competitive rate. But you're right. The pressure to get incremental liquidity is simply not there
given all the avenues we have for liquidity. And we could slow down the decline in brokered. We could use online
bank or we can grow the time deposits. We do expect core deposits to be relatively stable in the first-half of the
year and then we expect to see growth in the second-half of the year. And so we will continue to analyze and be
balanced on the profitability and the client demand piece of that. But that's how we're looking at it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then within the loan book, just in the C&I portfolio, [indiscernible] (01:12:04) of C&I loans that are the
finance and insurance companies. Can you give us an update as to what that entails? And then more specifically,
what component of those loans are to borrowers that are using that as leverage to make other commercial loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Look, the portfolios – our lender finance business. And as Jamie talked about earlier, maybe to give you some
comfort around the asset quality, those are the portfolios we're looking at to get the reduced risk-weighted asset
treatment. So, as Jamie mentioned, 100% risk weighting down to potentially a 20% risk-weighted treatment,
which means that there's good sponsorship, there's good coverage on the assets, and, to your point, these are
not levered assets. These are asset-based structures that provide repayment within the ability to liquidate those
assets.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Just wanted to – good morning. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. The first on growth. Just wanted to get a sense
for what inning you'd say we were in in terms of the strategic decline in non-relationship loans? I understand this
is included in the guide but it would be helpful to get a sense of the magnitude of the impact and timelines for that
headwind to abate and kind of get back to that growth, to your outlook that you were discussing earlier?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Look, when you look at the quarter, we had about $77 million of declines in the SNC portfolio, another $50 million
in third-party. Those will continue for the foreseeable future. Number one, remember that both of these were
surrogates for the securities portfolio when we had excess liquidity. And so, in this environment, unless we are
seeing better economic, we would expect that sort of run rate to continue. So, expect somewhere around $100
million to $120 million of runoff each quarter. So, that would not change.
Now, the good news is that could be more than offset as we get to some of these market-related declines. So,
once senior housing gets to kind of their final portfolio size and the real estate portfolio builds back their pipeline
to offset some of the paydown activities. I think that those market-related declines will more than offset the
growth. There, we will more than offset these strategic declines, which would put more of the growth back towards
that mid single-digit level.

We – if you look at the first quarter on GreenSky, it played out as expected. We had a strong quarter, a little less
than $8 million of revenue associated with that. And, going forward, the reason for the revenue will change. So, if
you think about it, that deal closed in the first quarter, so we had a pass-through of the loan book. But going
forward, it's the flow arrangement. And in the flow arrangement, we actually expect revenues to be in a similar
area, slightly below the first quarter but in a similar area per quarter as we go through 2024.
With regards to capital markets, we feel really good about 2024. We think its going to be a strong year for capital
markets coming off of the first quarter and increasing as we go through the year. And the components of capital
markets, we have client swaps which are relatively low at the moment but we expect to see growth in lead
arranger fees, the agency fees and we expect to see those as we go through 2024. And we think that can be one
of the good drivers. When we said, overall, NIR growth in the low to mid single-digits and a lot of that is capital
markets. We think that the strength there will continue as we go through this year.

some of them are more stressed than others. But from a debt service coverage perspective, it would be reflected
in our current rate status of around 10 basis – 10% rather on the rated book.
So, obviously lease expirations and lease rollovers and those types of things are what we're doing every day and
analyzing those, looking out to our maturities. And when these leases roll over or the sub-lease activities, et
cetera. So, a lot of variables in our office analysis, which is kind of built into our sort of normal portfolio
management business-as-usual activities today and it's reflected in our current risk ratings. And we feel good
about the accuracy of those right now.

Hey. A two-part question on the net interest margin expansion, the 10 to 15 basis points in second-half of this
year. How much of that are you expecting to occur in fourth quarter versus third quarter?
And then second part of the question is looking beyond that, is that a certain pace that we can expect going
forward or it could even be more just looking at your fixed rate loan repricing schedule, [ph] just looking to 2025
(01:20:09)?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Yeah. Brandon, that's a great question. We do expect to see that expansion largely in the second-half of the year
and late in the year is an important time for that expansion and largely due to some hedge maturities in the fourth
quarter. We have $750 million of hedge maturities in the fourth quarter at pretty low rates. And those will be
impactful to both the fourth quarter and then incrementally again to the first quarter in 2025.
I think when you think longer term about our margin, what I would say is, first, think about the headwinds on the
liability side. We clearly saw those in the first quarter. We expect those to be mitigated in the second quarter as
we see stabilization in both rate and mix. And so then you look at the margin and you think about the benefit of
the fixed rate asset repricing. And so that really becomes powerful and it's a multi-year benefit. And so we've
talked about that in the past but that benefit will flow through 2025, assuming rates stay relatively stable and we'll
continue to see that benefit.
And so when I look longer-term and I look at the fourth quarter of this year and I compare it to the fourth quarter of
2025, there is about a 20-basis-point benefit due to fixed rate asset repricing. And there are a lot of variables that
can impact that outside of those fixed rate repricing benefits. But that's a pretty important tailwind to the margin.
And so, yes, we expect the margin expansion to continue as we get into next year but just due to the fixed asset
repricing, but I just wanted to be really clear on that one.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Very helpful. And lastly on the RWA optimization. Once that's complete, how are you thinking about
basically deploying that capital generated into securities repositioning versus potentially buying back more
shares?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's a great question. And it's something that we're currently working through. And we'll make the
decisions on that once the analysis and documentation is complete because it's a pretty hefty lift to get to where
we want to be and make sure that we've done everything right.
But the way we are thinking about that is looking at our capital ratios and we also look at our capital ratios
inclusive of AOCI because we think that Cat IV banks, in the way that regulators are looking at it, we think that
that matters as well. And so we want to be balanced in how we deploy it. But assuming things play out, we likely
expect – we would expect to deploy a large portion of it to securities repositioning, deploy some of it to share
repurchases, but really just try to stay at the high-end of our target range of CET1, 10% to 10.5%. And so more to
come on that. You can be sure that as soon as we have everything locked down, which we expect in the near
term, we will let everybody know.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Kevin S. Blair
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Angela. And appreciate everyone being in attendance today and your continued interest in Synovus.
I'd also like to thank and recognize all of our team members who are listening in today. Our financial results, as
we presented them this morning, are a direct result of what you do daily to serve our clients and to differentiate us
from our competitors. Our first quarter results reflect a contraction in the margin and we believe that this will
reverse into expansion for the year to come. Our fee income expectations have risen. Our expenses are being
well-managed. On the credit front, as we've shared today, lots of metrics but the summary is the outlook for
charge-offs is stable to lower, even as we build our allowance higher. And from an overall business activity
standpoint, we're seeing some green shoots. Our loan pipelines are starting to increase a bit and sales activities
across our client segments are picking up.
As we've shared in recent quarters, our strategic focus is on leveraging our trusted and valued approach to
serving and advising our clients to deepen relationships and to deliver prudent and profitable growth. As we
navigate an uncertain economic and interest rate environment, we are equally focused on strengthening our
returns as well as our balance sheet, which, in turn, translates into a more risk-resilient profile. I truly believe that
we have progress throughout the remainder of this year and even into 2025 and we will continue to build upon our
momentum and return the bank to a more diversified and consistent growth orientation. For our investors, we look
forward to seeing many of you in the upcoming conferences in May and June. And we stand ready to address any
of your questions.
Thanks to all. And now operator, that concludes our first quarter 2024 earnings call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you, Kevin. This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your
lines.
