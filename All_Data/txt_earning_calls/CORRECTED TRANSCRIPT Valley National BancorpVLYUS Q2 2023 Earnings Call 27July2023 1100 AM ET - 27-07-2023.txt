With that, I'll turn the call over to Ira Robbins.

Ira D. Robbins
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Travis. In the second quarter of 2023, Valley reported net income of $139 million and earnings per
share of $0.27. Exclusive of non-core items, adjusted net income and EPS were $147 million and $0.28,
respectively.
The quarterly results were highlighted by strong and stable asset quality metrics, consistent loan activity,
improved deposit generation and solid non-interest income growth. The interest rate environment continues to
create cyclical pressures for traditional spread banks like Valley. We have conservatively positioned our balance
sheet in a neutral manner, which is both prudent and generates largely stable net interest income in varying
interest rate environments.
The current inverted curve pressures this approach, yet over the long run, we believe it is appropriate. We firmly
believe franchise value is not created by taking interest rate positions, but rather by increasing clients and
diversifying the balance sheet. The current cyclical pressure with the inverted curve, will ultimately normalize and
the recent client growth realized by Valley would generate significant value.
Outside of the cyclical variables impacting profitability, the banking environment has recently undergone structural
changes related to the movement of money. These changing trends will have long-term implications to the
banking environment. Our investment in technology over the last few years, both from a client and internal
operating perspective, coupled with the diversity of our balance sheet will mitigate some of these structural
changes and ultimately position Valley to capitalize on the evolutionary changes in which clients interact with their
financial institutions.
During my tenure, we have focused on consistent, tangible book value growth as a key driver of long-term
shareholder value. While recent market disruption has overshadowed these efforts, I am extremely proud of the
near 50% increase in tangible book value over the last five years. In fact, when adjusting for the common cash
dividend paid, we have generated over 90% growth in tangible book value since March of 2018.
As the market returns to [ph] valuing banks (04:04) on fundamentals, our consistent, tangible book value growth
will continue to be differentiating as we move forward.
In an effort to offset certain cyclical revenue headwinds, we began to implement a cost saving exercise in late
June. We remain focused on sustainable long-term growth, but acknowledge that we need to flexibly respond to
near-term pressures. Our identified phase will primarily come from lower head count, more efficient third-party
consulting and service usage and specific technology [ph] saves (04:34). These opportunities are expected to
generate more than $40 million of annual pre-tax savings and will be realized over the next four quarters.
Culturally, we are reinvigorating the attention to detail, which drove our efficiency improvement from the high 60%
range in the beginning of my tenure to the low 50% range in late 2022. Consistent with our history, we will
continue to position ourselves to capitalize on the dislocation around us. We anticipate that there will be
significant growth opportunities as the environment stabilizes and the yield curve ultimately normalizes. Values

are strong and vibrant institution operating in great markets. I remain extremely confident in our ability to execute
and I'm incredibly excited for what the future holds for our company.
With that, I would turn the call over to Tom and Mike to discuss the quarter's growth and financial results.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza
President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Ira. Slide 4 illustrates the $2 billion growth in our total deposits during the quarter, which reflects the
ongoing shift to higher cost products. The overwhelming majority of non-interest bearing deposit run-off occurred
by mid-May. Since then, both non-interest bearing and interest bearing transaction balances have been materially
unchanged. The quarter's growth reflects accelerated CD generation, which pressured our deposit beta and
weighed on our net interest margin.
Slide 5 provides more detail on the continued diversity of our deposit portfolio. Many of our specialty verticals
continue to perform well as we saw solid growth within our online channel and our national deposits of private
banking areas. The greater utilization of insurance products like ICS, we have continued to reduce our adjusted
uninsured deposit exposure. Adjusted uninsured deposit balances declined to $12 billion, with 24% of total
deposits and are now covered more than 200% by on balance sheet cash and available liquidity.
Slide 6 further illustrates the diversity and granularity of our deposit base. No commercial industry accounts for
more than 10% of our deposits. Our government portfolio remains diversified across our footprint and is fully
collateralized relative to state collateral requirements.
Turning to slide 7, you can see an overview of our loan growth and portfolio composition. Annualized loan growth
slowed to 10% from 16% in the first quarter, while origination yields continue to climb. We have worked through
the majority of the strong pipeline that existed coming into the year and anticipate mid-single digit annualized
growth for the remainder of 2023. We will continue to be selective on the lending side and generally supportive of
compelling projects, led by our high-quality and tenured customer base.
Slide 8 further illustrates the diversity of our commercial real estate portfolio by collateral type and geography. As
a reminder, we have an extremely granular loan portfolio with an average loan size of roughly $5 million. From a
metric perspective, our weighted average LTV and debt service coverage ratio remained at 58% and 1.8 times
respectfully. We believe these metrics compare favorably to peers as we have consistently and conservatively
underwritten to higher cap rates. Our experience with recent refinancing activity has been positive given the
adequacy of our past underwriting discipline.
Slide 9 provides additional detail on our granular office portfolio. Loan to values declined during the quarter and
our office portfolio remains well-positioned with a low average loan size.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn to provide additional insight on the quarter's financials.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Tom. Slide 10 illustrates Valley's recent quarterly net interest income and margin trends. The
sequential $16 million decline in net interest income was approximately half of the reduction experienced in the
first quarter of the year. While asset yields continue to improve, deposit mix shift in the first-half of the quarter and
continued pricing competition drove funding costs higher.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
Our fully tax equivalent net interest margin declined 22 basis points versus 41 basis points in the first quarter of
2023. We estimate that our elevated average cash position [indiscernible] (09:35) weighed on the absolute margin
by approximately 8 basis points.
As you saw on slide 4, our cumulative deposit beta increased to 47% in the quarter. During the quarter, we
enhanced our efforts to extend duration on the funding side. To this end, we added approximately $1 billion of
CDs beyond nine months and put on incremental FHLB funding out three years. We will continue to focus on
prudent balance sheet management and further enhancing our maturity ladder as opportunities present
themselves.
While non-interest deposit balances have been stable since mid-May, as total deposits grow, we anticipate that
the contribution of non-interest deposits will decline into the low-20% range. Through the cycle, betas now appear
likely to peak out at the mid 50% range by year-end. As a result of these factors, we anticipate that our 2023 full
year net interest income growth will be in the low single-digit percent range. We are seeing initial signs of
stabilization in net interest income and margin and increasingly expect that we are approaching a trough.
Moving to slide 11, we generated over $60 million of non-interest income for the quarter, as compared to $54
million in the first quarter. We saw strong growth in a variety of non-interest businesses during the quarter. Capital
markets revenue increased $6 million, primarily due to stronger swap activity. We also saw growth in our wealth
management and insurance lines and a modest rebound in gain on sale revenue. While we continue to diversify
our revenue sources, we are pleased that stronger fee income results helped to slow revenue compression as
compared to the first quarter.
On slide 12, you can see that our non-interest expenses were approximately $283 million for the quarter, or
approximately $267 million on an adjusted basis. The increase in adjusted expenses from the first quarter was
largely related to a higher FDIC assessment and consulting costs. Expenses in other categories were generally
well controlled. As Ira mentioned, we have identified over $40 million of annualized expense opportunities which
we have begun to execute on. During the quarter, we took approximately $11 million of restructuring charges,
primarily in the form of severance associated with these efforts. While these saves will take time to materialize,
we expect that they will help to offset potential revenue pressure and more regular expense growth over the next
few quarters.
We expect that just less than half of the annualized saves will be in our run rate by the end of the year, with the
rest of the saves to be achieved by the midpoint of 2024. These expense efforts should help to get efficiency back
on track. And we will continue to focus on opportunities beyond the $40 million that we have already identified.
Coming into the year, we set a 2023 expense growth guide of between 10.5% and 12.5%. We continue to feel this
is a reasonable level and believe these initiatives could bring us towards the lower end of that range.
Turning to slide 13, you can see our asset quality trends for the last five quarters. Non-accrual loans were
effectively flat at 0.51% of total loans, and early stage delinquencies declined by nearly 40% from the linked
quarter. Second quarter net charge offs were normalized as well, with nearly 50% coming from a single fully
reserved construction loan charge off. We have proactively addressed discrete problem credits in the last few
quarters and the data we see continues to indicate asset quality strength in the near term.
On slide 14, you can see that tangible book value increased approximately 1.8% for the quarter. This was the
result of our retained earnings, which was partially offset by a modest increase in the OCI impact associated with

our available for sale securities portfolio. Tangible common equity to tangible assets rebounded to 7.24% during
the quarter as we repaid maturing short-term debt with excess cash.
We estimate that our remaining excess cash position at June 30 weighed on our TCE to TA ratio by
approximately 12 basis points. For the second quarter, our CET1 and Tier 1 ratios were effectively flat. Our total
risk based ratio declined somewhat as a result of a partial disallowance of the legacy subordinated debt
instruments.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One
moment while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Perito with KBW.
Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. I wanted to start on just a couple clarification questions
around some of the guidance you guys just provided. I guess, first on the OpEx side. So, Mike, basically, it
sounds like, less than 50% contribution of the $40 million is expected to kind of maybe put you at the low-end of
the 10% to 12% range. Can you just remind us that that's off of kind of at the adjusted expense number, not the
GAAP number? Correct? And would you generally agree with that summary?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. That's accurate. Mike, this is Travis. So the base in 2022 was our reported expenses less merger charges
and then that 10.5% to 12.5% growth was based on that and again, ex-merger charges for 2023 comparison.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Perfect. And then, are you guys expecting any other noise in the FDIC insurance premium line moving forward
here? Just what are your expectations around that at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, Mike. It's Travis again. So, in our initial analysis of the potential special assessment associated with the first
two bank failures, the number looks to be in the $40 million range. Obviously, that's for us based on our
assessment base, that's our preliminary analysis still to be confirmed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Right. And that's 1Q, 2024 until the end of 2025. Correct?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
It's correct. It plays out over eight periods. I think just going back with the accounting folks this morning, I think,
you may accrue for it all day one, but still need to confirm that as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. All right. Perfect. Thanks. And then, just around the NII outlook, so, I mean, it sounds like there's expected
to be, maybe another step lower in the third quarter and then some stabilization. I mean, does that kind of jive
also, in terms of that NII dollar guide you gave Mike, but does that jive also maybe with kind of what you're
expecting at this point of trajectory of NIM? I mean, is there another step lower here and then based on where the
curve is today and the movement yesterday that your hope would be, especially with the growth taking maybe a
few 100 basis points, step back, on a net basis to stabilize as well or are there other factors over the back half of
the year we should be thinking about?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So based on our modeling right now and the use of the implied forward curve, the forecast implies a flat
NII. So I think it's going to be flattish heading into third quarter, give or take a few basis points, by the way. And
then, also it's important to remember, as we mentioned, that when you take the excess cash off, you get back to
an adjusted NIM of [ph] 302 (17:50). So I think as we work that cash down in the third quarter, we also see that
help increase the NIM a little bit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Perfect. And then, I'll just do one more, and then I'm sure others have questions as well. But just, Ira maybe just
would love your thoughts around you know, you guys were able to do a couple really productive M&A transactions
leading into this current environment over the last handful of years.
Obviously, right now, the M&A outlook is a little challenged. But you know, I imagine at some point there will be
some opportunities. And I'm just curious, at your current size, with everything going on in the market, what are
your just updated thoughts generally on the M&A opportunity for value longer term understanding it's not probably
something that's on the near-term agenda, but just would love your thoughts there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thanks, Ian. It's definitely not something that we're focused on from a prioritization perspective. I think organically,
there's a lot of excitement within the organization based on some of the verticals that we've done and just
[indiscernible] (18:50) capabilities that we've established over the last few years. So definitely inwardly focused at
this point in time. That said, I think, as we think about M&A, there are definitely going to be opportunities for us to
continue to grow from a strategic perspective. And anytime we see something that fits within the financial
discipline that we're focused on, that could accelerate some of the strategic objectives that we are looking at, we
would definitely be open to it. Right now, I think the industry environment creates a bit more challenges when it
comes to that though.

Hey, Mike. Just on the normalized liquidity commentary, what are you kind of defining as normalized liquidity and
how soon do you get there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think it's in – roughly, in the range of about a $0.5 billion when we're in a normal environment. Obviously
when you compare us to peers, you saw in the first quarter a significant build. You saw that retain some of that
build throughout the second quarter. But I think somewhere in that mid-ish $0.5 billion is probably normal go
forward for us in what would be considered a normal economy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q

Okay. Can you provide a little bit more color on perhaps when your model shows a normal economy?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
I think we're headed that direction right now. I think our belief right now is we model forward, especially, for NII
around further Fed rate increases as that, this increase that happened yesterday is the last one. And so, that
normalizes the economy going forward. There are some adjustments, obviously, the unemployment and GDP in
there. But overall, I think we're starting to get there. It's the beginning of it is the best way of saying it.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. I appreciate all the commentary on demand deposits remaining stable after mid-May. How does the NIM
progress through the quarter? And did you start to see similar signs of stability towards the end of the quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
Matt, this is Travis. So on a monthly basis, the margin was generally flat throughout the quarter. We ended June
at 2.94%, which was the quarterly number as well. I'd say that there was a little bit more excess liquidity
throughout the quarter as opposed to the June margin. So cash adjusted, maybe June was down somewhat
there.
Clearly signs of stabilization is pretty consistent. As you said, I mean, demand deposits were generally flat over
the last two or three months. That's kind of continued. So our model conservatively projects more compression
from non-interest deposit outflows, but it's not really what we've experienced so far.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q

And equitable yield, was that like a similar kind of $9 million number for the quarter?

Yeah, correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then, the last one for me, fee income, a lot of items went your way this quarter. Maybe just a little bit of help
there, what the guidance looks like for the next couple of quarters. And I was surprised to see how strong
commercial swap fees were. Maybe just some insight as to what happened underneath the hood over there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. Hey, Matt, it's Tom. Yeah, the fees were strong for the quarter. Swaps, it's just a bigger demand on the
swap front from our customer base. And we expect for the next two quarters to report in the mid-50s on the fee
income. We'll offset some of it through our newly, you know, the tax credit business has a seasonal uptick in the
fourth quarter and we've been doing a lot more [indiscernible] (22:54) finance through the products we received
from Leumi.

Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos
from JPMorgan. Your line is open.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I want to start on the non-interest bearing deposits. The outflows accelerated a bit this quarter. I think you were
calling for mid-25-ish percentage by year-end. You're there already. I think now [ph] you're saying (23:35) down to
low 20% range. Could you take us behind the scenes in terms of why that's coming at even lower than you guys
expected? Are companies just optimizing to a lower level of operating balance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think there are two main points to consider there, Steve. First, we're starting to see and we're continuing
to see consumers utilize their checking accounts for purchases. And some of our commercial treasury
optimization from our customer's standpoint as they manage their cash balances more precisely.
The other thing that is important to note that over the long-term history of Valley, the average non-interest bearing
as a percent of total deposits has only been 24%. So we're not that far off of what the average is, for a longer
period of time, that obviously incorporates a lot of different economic environments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And I'm curious, the original guidance on the efficiency ratio was around 50% for the
full-year, clearly, you are running above that taken the NII guide down now. So what's a more reasonable target
for the efficiency ratio for this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. And I think for the full year, in the lower 50s, with the help of the $40 million annualized expenses that we
announced. But again, obviously, not all those are going to be realized on the income statement in 2023. But I
think it will help us get to the lower 50% range.

Got it. Okay. And then final question. The loan growth is pretty strong and you had quite a bit of growth in
commercial real estate. It's an area we're not seeing many banks grow. Give some color on what you're seeing
there? Why you feel comfortable taking on more commercial real estate here? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, Steve, it's Tom. Our focus has really been on servicing our long-term existing customers. That commercial
real estate growth 84% came from our customer base, still very granular. The metrics of a debt service coverage
over 1.8 times, which is consistent with our historical underwriting and loan to value is in the 60% range.
So we're bringing them on to existing customers solid projects with the same credit metrics to underwriting
standards that we have always used. You will see 11% quarterly annualized growth in C&I and that's been
consistent for the past several quarters. So we continue to drive our C&I business, which gives us deposit and
additional fee opportunities while servicing those strong long-term real estate customers.

Hey, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the last set of questions on NIB deposits. So I think you said that
NIB deposits have been stable since mid-May. And yet you're saying that your guidance bakes in further outflows
as clients optimize their cash. So I'm just trying to square the two. Are you being more conservative or is that
based on in any conversations you're having with clients, maybe where ECR rates are going or even any flows
that you've seen quarter-to-date in 3Q.

Manan Gosalia Q

All right. Perfect. And then, just a question for me on loans. Some of your peers have announced loan sales
during the quarter, particularly in commercial real estate. Is that an opportunity that you're looking at or you could
look at in the future?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. At this point, we're not looking at that. We're comfortable with our return and risk requirements within our
portfolio. That said, if something compelling comes along, that's the right economics and allows us to redeploy
into higher value capital opportunities, we would certainly look at it.

Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Maybe just on loan yields, I'm just curious where is loan pricing these days in terms of just what is the total add-on
yield? I know you guys typically talk in spreads, but just kind of curious as to, are you in the 7s for loan pricing
these days or just have to think about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Hey, Steve, the loan yields for the quarter was around [ph] 7.35%, for June. It was just about 7.7% (29:28).
We've been consistently receiving spreads in the mid-3s for the past several quarters. The new business, new
production we're putting on, it's coming at a higher spread than historical levels.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, great. And then, in terms of the cumulative deposit beta, I think I heard mid-50s earlier. It kind of sounds
like you guys think the margin maybe troughs here or maybe deposit costs peak in the fourth quarter, I should
say, and stabilized for 2024 is kind of how you guys are thinking about it right now? Just want to make sure I
heard that correctly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
I think that's a fair assumption. Also, we're starting to see we've been seeing this, but we started to see in the
second quarter a very nice ramp up in the generation of new accounts. So as an example, new depository
accounts were at the highest level they've been in the prior six quarters in two quarter – or second quarter of
2023. So I think we have the migration of non-interest bearing interest bearing, which is going to impact your beta.
You also have the ability to add new deposits as well. Those incremental new deposits probably come on a little
higher cost. But the engine that we've created obviously shows, as I mentioned, that we're at the highest level in
the last 18 months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Steve, one of the things I think that impacts that is the decline in some of the projected loan growth. We were
growing 17% in the first quarter, 10% this last quarter. As we guide towards the mid-single digits after the next two
quarters, the demand for deposits are going to decline within the organization as well. So that should have a
significant impact on what this forward-looking betas look like.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Appreciate all that and maybe just one more thing in terms of dynamic of slowing loan growth here. How
much do you think is customer conservatism versus wider spreads here going forward? Just kind of any sense
you have for the economy and how customers are?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Hey, Steve. It's really, both are a factor. Certainly the widening spreads has had customers relook at the
value of the projects and many are holding off and pausing until they see what the interest rate environment levels

out at. From the cautious standpoint, we're not seeing as much, certainly C&I companies are managing their
inventory tighter than they had been. But we're not seeing the same level of cautiousness.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Just a few follow-ups. I think most of my questions have been answered, but just back on the margin. Are you
– bigger picture, you guys optimistic on the margin beyond the third quarter? Is it returning to normal? It feels that
way, but I thought I'd ask it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think one of the interesting things is, is how we look at the margin. You go back over a two-year period,
the volatility in our margin has been about a 22% number versus about 30% for the peers. So I think, in an
inverted curve which are cyclical, these things happen, for us [indiscernible] (32:57) margin compression.
I don't anticipate operating in an inverted curve for the rest of my career, [indiscernible] (33:03) rest of the
management team does either. So, the margin will ultimately rebound and come back up to a more normalized
level. And when that happens, I think, the franchise value of the organization is going to increase dramatically.
We're opening up more accounts today than we've ever opened before when amazing individual vertical business
lines that we weren't in before.
And the balance sheets obviously shifted, three, four, five years ago, 17% of its balance sheet was in residential
mortgages. You look at the concentration that we have in C&I today and the diversification even within the CRE
portfolio, it's a very different balance sheet and we believe that there'll be definitely some benefit coming forward
as the interest rate environment normalizes.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. So control what you can, right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay, Mike, on slide 12, there's a comment about the last bullet. Additional variable expense opportunities.
What's an example of that, and what's the potential magnitude there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. It's some of the usage things, right, that we have discretion over. [indiscernible] (34:03) that could be
consulting costs. It could be the additional usage of contracts, because we're going to go through a core
conversion in the fourth quarter that might spill off, and we might have some additional savings there as well. But
it's also adding to knowledge. Having an organization that looks at cost and with a critical eye and tries to
eliminate everything that we don't really need to do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then, I guess, the last one on the allowance. Did you guys change your qualitative thinking at all in
terms of your reserve levels? I'm just curious, a gut check on do you expect a worsening economy? Do you feel
like a [ph] worsening economy is already inflected (34:50) in your reserves? Just give me some thoughts on that.
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
You know, I'll start off here. This is Mike. And then our Chief Credit Officer is here as well. So I'll have him fill in
where I get this wrong. But I think the first thing to note on this is, we did migrate the ratings on Moody's. So that's
the first thing to kind of take into account. And we went to a slightly higher percentage, 10% more on the baseline
and we reduced S-4 which is that more severe recessionary. Why did we do that?
As Moody's refines their estimates each quarter, the baselines started to capture more of the, if you will, negative
both GDP and unemployment numbers. And so, we've always been conservative in our ratings, I think, relative to
our peers on this. But as we've taken a look at their numbers, it became pretty apparent that the baseline would
capture more of that. So we did make that change, which has some bearing on allowance in the CECL model.
And then, I'll turn over to Mark.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Saeger A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Right. This is Mark Saeger. Yeah, Mike. That's absolutely accurate. We had been holding at the [ph] 50, 30, 20 on
– the 30 and 20 (36:00) on the two downside scenarios based off of a continued migration to a slightly more

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
negative conservative outlook on Moody's baseline, we did back that off. That being said, that was not a material
change in the overall weighting, because our movement of the 10% was offset by the more negative outlook on
the baseline.
So we view that as modest. We did not impose any additional qualitative overlays on the ALLL for this quarter, as
we did not see any material weaknesses in portfolio that warranted qualitative adjustments upwards where we are
looking at performance of portfolio in the future to see if that that may be necessary. But the performance of
portfolio continues to be exceptionally strong and does not warrant any qualitative overlays.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Interesting comment on the baseline being almost approaching us for. So that's a good comment. So
thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
