Paul Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thanks, Kristie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Fiscal year 2020 brought some
incredible challenges, what a year. In many ways, I'm glad to get it behind us. First, we had the unfolding of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Everyone started working from home almost overnight. We experienced social unrest in our
country, uncertain economic outlook, a presidential and congressional election and a reduction in force, which is
extremely rare at Raymond James.
On the other hand, while this year was one of my more difficult years in my career, in many ways, it was also
more rewarding because of the way our associates and advisors came together to respond to the crisis, really
reinforced our unique culture at Raymond James. We kept true to our guiding principles, our core value of
conservatism looking long term and focusing on serving our clients that resulted in great growth even during this
period of time.
And recruiting was very strong that new assets, great retention all resulted in record client assets under
administration. So, I want to take this opportunity to say thank you. Thank you to all of our associates and
advisors for their tremendous contributions and their unwavering commitment to serving their clients.
Now, let me turn to the financials starting on slide 3. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the firm reported net revenues of
$2.08 billion, net income of $209 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.50. Excluding expenses of $46
million associated with the reduction of workforce and a $7 million loss associated with the pending disposition of
certain non-core operations in France, adjusted quarterly net income was $249 million and adjusted earnings per
diluted share was $1.78. Return on equity was 11.9% and adjusted return on tangible common equity was 15.3%.
Quarterly net revenues grew 3% over the prior-year period and 13% over the preceding quarter, primarily driven
by higher asset management and related administrative fees, strong fixed income brokerage revenues and record
investment banking revenues, which were partially offset by the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates.
Quarterly expenses were higher due mainly to compensation expense associated with higher compensation
compensable revenues and reduction in workforce expense incurred during the quarter. While the loan loss
provision was higher on a year-over-year basis, it declined significantly from the preceding two quarters as the
economy and economic conditions tended to stabilize and credit quality of the loan portfolio remained resilient.
But given the high degree of market uncertainty, we still wanted to be prudent and adding to our reserves.
Looking at the fiscal year 2020 results on slide 4, we generated record net revenues of nearly $8 billion, but lower
short-term interest rates and higher loan loss reserves caused the net income to decline to $818 million. On an

adjusted basis, net income was $585 million (sic) [$858 million] (00:05:43), down 20% compared to the adjusted
net income in fiscal 2019.
Record revenues grew over the prior year as the continued growth of client asset along with record fixed income
brokerage and investment banking revenues offset the negative impact of lower interest rates. We generated
record revenues in the Private Client Group, Capital Markets, and Asset Management segments during the fiscal
year, reinforcing the value of having diverse and complementary businesses.
Moving on to slide 5, we ended the quarter and fiscal year with period in records for total client assets under
administration of $930 billion, Private Client Group assets in fee-based accounts of $475 billion and financial
assets under management of $153 billion. The strong client asset growth was predominantly driven by equity
market appreciation and our continued success in recruiting and retaining financial advisors across all of our
affiliation options.
During the fiscal year, we had a net increase of 228 financial advisors to end with a record number of 8,239, a
solid result particularly given delays in recruiting and onboarding of advisors during the onset of the COVID-19
crisis. During the fiscal year, financial advisors would go for $275 million of trailing 12 production at approximately
$49 billion of assets under prior firms affiliated with Raymond James domestically. That includes recruiting results
during the fourth quarter of $82 million of trailing 12 production and $13.8 billion of assets under prior firms, which
was by far our best quarter for recruiting during the fiscal year.
As for our net organic growth results in the Private Client Group during the year, we generated domestic PCG net
new assets of $49 billion, representing 6.5% of domestic PCG client asset at the beginning of the year. Based on
what we've seen, we believe this to be amongst the very best in our industry even including the e-brokers who
benefited from the surge of day and online trading during the year. Looking forward, we are continuing to
experience strong recruiting activity across all of our affiliation options as we are in fiscal year 2021. At the
quarter-end, net bank loans were $21.2 billion as growth of loans in the PCG clients was offset by a decline in
corporate loans.
Moving to the segment results on slide 6. The Private Client Group generated quarterly net revenues of $1.39
billion and pre-tax income of $125 million. Quarterly net revenues grew by 12% over the preceding quarter
predominantly driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees reflecting higher assets in fee-
based accounts, which will continue to be a tailwind for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This strong revenue growth
helped PCG's pre-tax income grow 37% sequentially, although it was down 13% on a year-over-year basis
primarily due to the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates.
The Capital Markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of $410 million and record pre-tax income
of $106 million, a truly amazing quarter for Capital Markets driven by broad-based strength across fixed income,
global equity and investment banking, as well as the Raymond James tax credit funds.
During the quarter, fixed income brokerage revenues continued to benefit from a high level of client activity,
particularly with small and mid-sized depositary clients. Record investment banking revenues were driven by the
strength in equity underwriting, M&A, and debt underwriting.
The Asset Management segment generated quarterly net revenues of $184 million and record pre-tax income of
$78 million. Record quarterly pre-tax income was driven by the growth of financial assets under management, as
equity market appreciation and net inflows into the PCG fee-based accounts more than offset the net outflows for
Carillon Tower associates.

Lastly, Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $161 million and pre-tax income of $33 million.
Compared to the year-ago quarter, net revenues declined primarily due to lower net interest income as lower
short-term interest rates caused net interest margin to decline 121 basis points compared to a year-ago period.
The quarterly loan loss provision of $45 million increased the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans
to 1.65%.
On slide 7, you can see the fiscal year results for all of our segments. The firm's record revenues were driven by
record revenues in the Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset Management segment, a reflection of our
attractive organic growth and consistent market share gains across businesses. Additionally, the Capital Markets
segment management segment generated record annual net pre-tax income, as both segments generate
significant operating leverage during the year. Meanwhile, the pre-tax income declined in both Private Client
Group and Raymond James Bank segments due to lower short-term interest rates and higher loan loss provisions
of the bank.
And now for a more detailed review of the financial results, I'll turn the call over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. I'll begin with consolidated revenues on slide 9. Record quarterly net revenues of $208 billion
grew 3% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Asset management fees grew 9% on a year-over-year basis and
16% sequentially commensurate with the sequential increase in fee-based assets. Private client group assets and
fee-based accounts were up 7% during the fiscal fourth quarter, which will provide a tailwind for this line item for
the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
Consolidated brokerage revenues of $495 million grew 10% over the prior year. The continued strength and fixed
income trading helped fuel this growth. For the year, consolidated brokerage revenues were up 8% to almost $2
billion lifted by strong institutional fixed income brokerage revenues of $421 million, which were up 49% over
fiscal 2019. While the fixed income business is continuing to benefit from high client activity levels, these
revenues are inherently difficult to predict.
So, I think a reasonable assumption for fiscal 2021 is that these brokerage revenues may end up somewhere
between the results in fiscal year 2019 and the record achieved in fiscal year 2020. But again, it is highly
uncertain and will largely be driven by market conditions throughout the year.
Account and service fees of $140 million declined 22% year-over-year, primarily due to the decrease in RJBDP
fees from third-party banks due to lower short-term interest rates, which I'll discuss along with net interest income
in more detail on the next two slides.
Consolidated investment banking revenues of $222 million grew 41% year-over-year, achieving a record result
driven by strong equity underwriting, debt underwriting, and M&A advisory revenues. For the fiscal year, we
generated record investment banking revenues of $650 million, which were up 9% over the prior year's record.
Really amazing results given the high degree of market uncertainty during the year. While our investment banking
pipelines are robust, closings will largely be dependent on conducive markets, which we can't necessarily count
on given we are still in the middle of a global pandemic.

Turning to other revenue, which was $57 million for the quarter. This line included $12 million of private equity
valuation gains, of which approximately $3 million were attributable to non-controlling interest reflected in other
expenses. Additionally, tax credit fund revenues finished the year with a very strong fiscal fourth quarter.
Moving to slide 10. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances, which are the primary source of funding for interest
earning assets in the balance of the third-party banks that generate RJBDP fees into the quarter at $55.6 billion,
increasing 7% sequentially and representing 6.7% of domestic PCG client assets.
On slide 11, the top chart displays our firm wide net interest income in RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a
combined basis as these two items are directly impacted by changes in short-term interest rate.
As you can see, the interest rate cuts have put significant pressure on this revenue stream, which on a combined
basis are down $143 million compared to the prior year's fiscal fourth quarter. This has had and is expected to
continue to have provided significant headwinds for a compensation ratio in pre-tax margin, particularly as these
revenue streams are not directly compensable.
On the bottom of slide 11, RJ Bank's NIM was 2.09% in the fourth quarter, just below the range we've guided to
last quarter. The sequential decline in NIM was predominantly caused by the decline in LIBOR as well as the
higher concentration of lower yielding agency-backed securities on the bank's balance sheet. But remember,
while the agency-backed securities reduced the bank's NIM, they do represent an increase in spread compared to
what we earned off-balance sheet with third-party banks. If LIBOR rates have bottomed out going forward, the
bank's NIM should really be impacted more by asset mix and market spread. But based on what we know now,
we are expecting the bank's NIM could be around 2% in fiscal 2021.
On the bottom right portion of the slide, the average yield on RJBDP fees up 33 basis points. While down
significantly year-over-year due to lower short-term interest rates, was flat sequentially. We expect this to remain
around 30 basis points in fiscal 2021.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 12. First, compensation expense, which is by far our largest expense.
The compensation ratio decreased sequentially from 69.6% to 68.1% during the quarter primarily due to record
revenues in the Capital Markets segment, which had a 56% compensation ratio during the quarter.
The year-over-year increase in the compensation ratio was primarily due to the negative impact from lower short-
term interest rates, as I explained on the last slide. During the quarter, we announced a reduction in force, which
is something we very seldom do given our strong culture and the value we place on stability at Raymond James.
But the reduction was unfortunately unavoidable given the significant impact of the unexpected interest rate cuts
in March. All else being equal, we expect the reduction in force to benefit the compensation ratio and consolidated
pre-tax margin by approximately 100 basis points starting in the fiscal first quarter of 2021.
However, it is important to remember that the compensation ratio is also impacted by revenue mix, given the
different compensation ratios in each one of our segments. PCG has the highest compensation ratio due to the
independent contractor channel where advisors received high payouts because they cover most of their overhead
expenses like real estate. The compensation ratio is also impacted by the level of recruiting activity as transition
assistance is amortized in the compensation line. For example, this year, advisor transition assistance and
retention amortization had an impact of approximately 340 basis points to the firm's overall compensation ratio.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
So, a lot of moving parts. But given near-zero short-term interest rates, we are confident we can maintain a
compensation ratio of 70% or better, especially after the reduction in force and that's utilizing conservative
assumptions relative to the record Capital Markets results we achieved in the fiscal fourth quarter in fiscal year
2020. I will touch a bit more on compensation on the next slide.
Onto non-compensation expenses. Non-compensation expenses of $408 million increased 17% year-over-year
as lower business development expenses were more than offset by a higher bank loan loss provision along with
$46 million associated with reduction in the workforce expenses and a $7 million loss associated with the pending
disposition of certain non-core operations in France. Other expenses also increased during the quarter due to
several items hitting during the quarter, including a reserve for state franchise taxes, the aforementioned non-
controlling interest associated with the private equity valuation gains, and a couple of other items.
I know many of you may ask what our guidance is for non-compensation expenses in fiscal 2021. Unfortunately,
there is just too much uncertainty to provide guidance on that line item. For example, business development
expenses and bank loan loss provision expenses are two items that will be heavily influenced by the COVID-19
pandemic and the economic recovery throughout the year.
What I can tell you is we are extremely focused on managing each and every single one of the controllable
expenses, while still investing in growth and high-service levels for our advisors and their clients.
Turning to slide 13, there's been a lot of focus on expense management over the past few years, so we thought it
was appropriate to take a minute to reflect on the trend. This chart depicts the year-over-year growth rate of
administrative compensation expense in the Private Client Group segment since fiscal year 2016.
We highlight this particular expense item because it incorporates the majority of the compensation growth
associated with the infrastructure buildup we have been focused on over the past several years, including the
majority of technology, operations, and risk management control areas as we fully allocate almost all these
expenses to the businesses and PCG is by far our largest business. As you can see, after short-term interest
rates started increasing at the end of 2015, we reinvested our large portion of the spread benefit into our
businesses to strengthen our platform.
About two years ago, we told you that we would start decelerating that growth, which you can really see this fiscal
year with a 4% growth rate. And after our recent reduction in force, we expect this growth rate to be even lower,
maybe even close to flat in fiscal year 2021. And remember, this administrative compensation also includes
growth-related expenses like new sales assistant that joined the firm with a recruited advisor, so we hope to see
this line grow over time just as long as we keep it lower than long-term revenue growth.
So, this slide really highlights two things. First, we use this benefit of higher spread to reinvest in that business
and ensure we have a platform that can support our future growth and we are glad we took advantage of that
window of opportunity as we wouldn't want to be playing catch-up with our infrastructure investments in this rate
environment. And secondly, the deceleration of these expenses reinforces our longstanding approach to
managing controllable expenses especially during difficult market environment.
Slide 14 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. Pre-tax margin was 12.3% in the fiscal fourth
quarter of 2020 and adjusted pre-tax margin was 14.9%. Again, I know many of you would want our guidance for
this metric, but there's just simply too much market uncertainty in the midst of this pandemic could give you
targets with any level of confidence. But the margins this quarter were obviously boosted by the record capital
market results as this segment generates a 26% pre-tax margin, which is a record.

On slide 15, at the end of fiscal fourth quarter, total assets were approximately $47.5 billion, a 6% sequential
increase. This increase was primarily attributable to shifting client assets from third-party banks to Raymond
James bank for the continued purchases of securities. Liquidity is very strong. Cash at the parent was more than
$2 billion, of which about $1 billion are excess cash over our conservative target.
But we are intentionally maintaining even more cash than we typically hold given the high degree of market
uncertainty. So, with cash at the parent of more than $2 billion, a total capital ratio of 25.4% and a Tier 1 leverage
ratio of 14.2%, we have substantial amount of capital and liquidity with plenty of flexibility to be both defensive and
opportunistic.
Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. In the fourth quarter, we
repurchased approximately 678,000 shares for $50 million, an average price of approximately $73.75 per share.
As of October 27, 2020, $487 million remained available under the board's current share repurchase
authorization.
In total, over the past five quarters, we returned nearly $680 million to shareholders through dividends and
repurchases under the board's authorization. With our strong capital liquidity position, we expect to continue share
repurchases of at least $50 million per quarter to offset share-based compensation dilution in fiscal 2021. And we
will certainly consider doing more buybacks during the year as well as appropriate.
On the next two slides, we provide additional detail on the bank's loan portfolio. Slide 17 provides some detail in
Raymond James Bank's asset composition. In the pie chart, you can see we have a really well-diversified portfolio
with a focus over the past few years to grow residential mortgages and securities-based loan to Private Client
Group clients as well as significantly increase the size of the securities portfolio, which ended the quarter at $7.7
billion or 25% of the bank's total assets. These securities are almost all agency-backed securities. So, we have a
much more diversified portfolio now than we did before the last financial crisis. The slide also highlights the
diversification we have within each segment of the portfolio.
Lastly, on slide 18, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. During the quarter, we
opportunistically sold approximately $340 million of corporate loans at the average selling price of 92% of our
value. In total, over the past two quarters, we sold nearly $700 million of corporate loans associated with
industries we believe are most vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. While we are now much more confident
with the remaining corporate loans in our portfolio, we will continue to be opportunistic in selling certain corporate
loans, but we've also recently resumed being opportunistic and deliberate in investing in new corporate loans that
are in sectors that we believe are less negatively impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.
Quarterly net charge-offs of $26 million were all related to the aforementioned loan sales during the quarter. The
quarterly loan loss provision of $45 million resulted in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans
to increase to 1.65%. And for the corporate portfolios, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of C&I loans
increased to 2.7%. And for CRE loans, it increased to 3.1%. While non-performing assets remained low at just 10
basis points of total assets in the fourth quarter, the amount of criticized loans increased, as we have still been
proactive in downgrading loans as we get more information.
But we have experienced positive trends with deferrals during the quarter. As of September 30, only 11 of our
corporate loans representing 1.7% of balances were on COVID-related deferral, which was down from 3.1% in
the preceding quarter. Similarly, residential mortgages on COVID-related deferrals declined from 2.6% of
balances in the preceding quarter to just 1.6% of balances at the end of the quarter.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
We implemented CECL on October 1, which we expect will increase our allowances by approximately $40 million
to $50 million with the majority of that increase attributable to recruiting and retention related loans to financial
advisors in PCG, which now require a larger allowance under CECL than it did under the incurred loss method.
Going forward, our allowances and provision expenses will be impacted by macroeconomic conditions as well as
individual loan performance using the CECL model. And as the surge in COVID cases in the past two weeks has
reminded us, we are not out of the woods yet.
Now, I'm turning the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. As for our outlook, we are extremely well-positioned entering fiscal 2021 with strong capital
ratios and quarter – and record for client assets and the number of Private Client Group financial advisors.
However, we will face continued headwinds from a full year of lower short-term interest rates and there's still a
high degree of uncertainty given the COVID-19 pandemic and upcoming presidential and congressional election.
In the Private Client Group segment, our financial advisor recruiting pipeline is strong across all of our affiliation
options, and the segment is going to benefit by starting the fiscal first quarter of 2021 with a 7% sequential
increase of assets and fee-based accounts.
In the Capital Markets segment, investment banking activity levels remain strong and we're cautiously optimistic
so long as the economic conditions don't deteriorate that that will continue. And in fixed income, brokerage
revenues have remained strong thus far in October, but we've set a high bar to keep up with for next year.
In the Asset Management segment, results will be positively impacted by higher financial assets under
management as long as the equity markets remain resilient.
And Raymond James Bank will continue to benefit from the attractive growth of mortgages and securities-based
loans to PCG clients.
Given the high degree of uncertainty, we'll continue to be conservative and cautious with adding to the corporate
loan portfolio and we will be ready and willing to resume more significant corporate loan growth when the
economic outlook is more certain. Our growth priorities remain unchanged. Our top priority is organic growth,
which is primarily driven by retaining and recruiting advisors in the Private Client Group. And as I stated earlier,
our annual organic PCG domestic net new asset growth of 6.5% in fiscal year 2020 has been best-in-class in the
industry despite the COVID-19 related challenges. Additionally, we are continuing to add senior talent in our other
businesses such as investment banking.
We also continue to actively pursue acquisitions. We will still be deliberate and pursue only transactions that are
of great cultural fit as well as a strategic and economic benefit. We are entering into more discussions than ever
as we see the year end coming closer and the economic uncertainty has brought more people to the table. As
Paul Shoukry mentioned, we are still continuing to repurchase shares to offset share-based compensation
solution and are prepared to increase repurchases as appropriate when the economic outlook is clear.
Before we open the line for questions, I want to thank all of our associates and advisors again for their invaluable
contributions during these trying times. I'm incredibly proud of our accomplishments and the tireless efforts to

support each other and our clients. We are entering fiscal 2021 well-positioned in all of our businesses and we
have significant opportunities for continued growth.
We have something special here at Raymond James, where we have the scale and scope of services to compete
with the largest firms in the industry, while at the same time having this unique advisor and client-facing culture
that's increasingly difficult to find in our industry. As long as we preserve that unique competitive advantage and
advisor-centric attitude, I'm confident in our ability to generate relatively attractive long-term returns for our
shareholders in any market.
With that, operator, I'd like to open it up for questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Certainly. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question
comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Hey.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I know you – hey. So, I know you don't have any guidance around pre-tax margins in the near term. I mean, I
noticed that there's a lot of uncertainty, especially on the non-comp side side. But I was wondering if you can help
us with where you think you can manage the business once we're past the loan loss cycle, but we still have lower
rates.
And as you speak to that, maybe you can also talk to the puts and takes out from the 14.9% adjusted margin you
have this quarter, and with the headwinds out from your – and those rates and in hiring, but it also sounds like you
have some more room on the expense side. So, if you can give us more details there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Like you said, a lot of moving parts. So, obviously, the record result in capital markets, which generated I
think a 26% margin, certainly lifted the firm's overall margins. And that's just a high bar going forward. And then
business development expenses, obviously still subdued given the COVID-19 pandemic and the provisions are
elevated. Hopefully, they're elevated. Hopefully, they get better going forward as we have more economic
certainty.
So, a lot of puts and takes, which is why it's hard to give you guidance here near-term. What I can tell you is if you
look historically at our pre-tax margin, last time we were in a kind of near-zero rate environment, we were
10


Raymond James Financial, Inc.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
generating roughly a 15% type pre-tax margin. Now, we're entering this period with higher recruiting results
coming into this period.
So, that leads to higher transition assistance amortization. I think the impact of that relative to that period of time
is about 100 basis points. So, we're not really ready to give targets yet. But if you just do that math, it will get you
to about a 14% to 15% type pre-tax margin. But again, that could be two years out, I mean, depending on market
conditions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think the other challenge is Private Client Group will have tailwinds with the 7% starting in their asset base into
the quarter. But obviously, capital markets have very, very strong results. And especially [ph] middle of (00:35:10)
the quarter, I mean capital markets is lumpy by nature of closings or lumpy by nature.
So, it's just challenging to come with a number. But again, we're razor-focused on expenses. We've operated in
that 14% to 15% margin when we had no help from interest rate not that many years ago, so in the same team.
So, we're focused on managing our expenses and on growth. So, it's just hard to give guidance given pandemic
may impact loan loss reserves, which will certainly impact the numbers, or the company continue to operate in our
portfolio, they won't be elevated. So, it's just too difficult to give a number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Then maybe on the securities side, you added about $2 billion to your securities for this quarter. But at the
same time, it looks like deposits at both third-party banks and RJF Bank were up quite substantially in the quarter
as you're getting a fair amount of deposit growth. Do you have some sort of target amount that you are
comfortable holding in securities? And can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the duration risk?
It's long [indiscernible] (00:36:23) from there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I think we still want to be more exposed to the short end of the curve than the long end of the curve just
given the floating rate nature of our deposits. So, we did grow securities substantially. But if you think about our
balance sheet priorities in terms of where we want to grow the bank, the first priority would be growing loans to
Private Client Group clients, both mortgages and securities-based loans, really because it has two-pronged
benefit.
The first is, it helps us strengthen our advisors, strengthen their relationships with their clients with really what's a
competitive mortgage- and securities-based loan offering. And it also generates a very good risk-adjusted return
for the bank. So, it's not sort of a win-win, which is why that's the highest priority and it fortunately has been
growing pretty consistently at an attractive rate.
Our second priority typically is growing the corporate loan portfolio, but obviously given the pandemic that we're in
the midst of, we've actually been selling loans as you know. And we're going to be very selective in adding new
loans that are less exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic.
And then really our third priority is growing the securities, particularly now when the incremental yield you get for
the duration exchange is paltry relative to the risk-return tradeoff. So, we're going to do that all in the context of
11

trying to keep the bank's standalone Tier 1 leverage ratio at around 7.5%, give or take, which is where it is now
after we've grown the securities portfolio right around 7.5%. And we could always – we have a lot more capital.
We have a 14% ratio at the firm overall, so we could always contribute more capital to the bank if one of those
three categories of assets that the bank generates higher volumes at attractive risk-adjusted return. So, that's kind
of how we're thinking about it. So, while we have a lot of capital and cash capacity to grow the bank more rapidly,
given where we are in the midst of this COVID-19 pandemic, I think we're going to be very patient in deploying
that capacity.

Hey guys. This is Michael Anagnostakis filling in for Steven. Congrats on a great quarter. Just wanted to start off
with one on the expense savings opportunity. I guess my question is based on the expense actions you're taking,
12

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
assuming some normalization of activity, how should we think about efficiency levels or how we're going to see
that impact flow through the expense run rate? And should we expect a slower pace of expense growth from
here? Thanks so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think what I said in my prepared remarks was that the reduction in the workforce would benefit the compensation
ratio and the pre-tax margin. All else being equal, which it never is, but all else being equal, it'd benefit those two
metrics by about 100 basis points starting in the fiscal first quarter of 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think that certainly the difference is we saw the expense chart that Paul talked about earlier. So, we are
managing expenses very tightly. So, certainly, we see this year on an apples-to-apples basis that growth as Paul
said could be [indiscernible] (00:40:44). So, we're managing it very tightly. Now, if the economy opens up and
there's more business development and [indiscernible] (00:40:52) certainly that will impact expenses. But as you
can see, the expenses of managing down it before the pandemic by the results last year and the expense from
the reduction in force really benefit starting this quarter. So, I think you're going to see tighter [indiscernible]
(00:41:13) to your business expense management given the environment just as we did years ago in a zero-rate
environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Anagnostakis Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
All right. Great. Thanks. My follow-up, maybe just pivoting over to M&A. We've seen continued consolidation in
the asset management space. Could you give some color around your appetite for potentially doing a deal in that
space or maybe other areas? Thanks again.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I think our priorities on M&A haven't changed. The first is, with focus on the Private Client Group, there's an
area of where – to our main business, but there aren't a lot of opportunities generally in that space that move the
needle. And our type of wealth management business, but certainly are active there and are proactive reaching
out. And then just the same, we continue to grow that business organically through recruiting and through
strategic niche acquisition, and certainly looking there. And Asset Management is also an area we'd look to add to
the products and opportunities.
So, those are the areas we focused on. But we're open in any parts that actually improve our businesses and
strategically will have a long-term impact. We aren't looking at deals for size. So, there's been [indiscernible]
(00:42:37) in the market that's really just to call a financial engineering or lower revenue or advisor or – and we're
looking at really staying true to our core businesses and growing and expanding our service offerings, not just as
being bigger for bigger sake.

Operator: Thank you. Continuing on, we now have a question from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please go
ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thank you very much for taking my question this morning. First question, just maybe staying on the capital
management theme for a moment. You mentioned that, yeah, obviously a lot of firepower in the balance sheet
and that you look to sort of pick up buyback as sort of things improve. Can you give us a sense of what
milestones you might be looking at at the macroeconomic level so you get that comfort? Or perhaps some kind of
valuation metric of your own stock that we can monitor to sort of see or anticipate some of your more than just the
offset of stock-based comp dilution?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I mean, that's a very complex question in terms of with long-term valuation metrics as we've looked to repurchase.
The difference right now is the environmental outlook, which is hard to steady. So, there's a lot of – there's also a
lot of negative implications where regulators look around share repurchases. And for those I'll call it public interest
in shareholder purchases.
So, [ph] in our (00:44:13) time right now, where as we look at wave two, which is obviously getting the country is,
when do we think [indiscernible] (00:44:19). And we want capital not just for defensive purposes, but we also
believe that there is a more difficult economic comp as we see in this period drag out a little longer, more interest
[ph] and keep (00:44:35) doing things.
So, that's going to be the judgment call. It's not clear what's going to happen in these next couple of quarters with
the pandemic and so until we get a view on that that we think we'd get solid economic returns off that, we're going
to hold back and make sure that we have plenty of capital to be both defensive and offensive. So, I can't give you
a [ph] straight (00:45:02) answer around it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then last and maybe just a follow-up question [indiscernible] (00:45:07), Paul. Just in
terms – appreciate all the guidance around expenses where you can. Given your very strong recruiting pipeline
and I appreciate this is a very fluid fiscal year for you. The business development costs in this particular quarter, is
this a fair run rate relative to the recruitment pipeline or is there some potential lift in that given the very strong
recruitment pipeline that you're speaking to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, the business development costs down 50% I think year-over-year just reflects a lack of travel,
client-related activity relative to normal activity levels. So, I would expect as we get through the COVID crisis for
business development costs too expensive to get much closer to where they were, maybe even going back to the
first quarter of the fiscal year even with that elevated recruiting. But again, it will depend on how much recruiting
we do going forward. But I would say, certainly, this quarter's number was very low.

And a lot of that too there are big numbers in conferences and things that have been postponed that we don't see
really coming certainly. We've moved back everything to the first half of the year, but now our [ph] determined
reward (00:46:28) groups are educational conference. These are important to us and our culture. But those
[indiscernible] (00:46:37) some point.
But we don't see them coming in these next few quarters. And true that this in recruiting, we've pulled out a
deferred recruiting. We have a lot of [ph] commitment (00:46:47) that have pushed back join dates because of
COVID and that breaks through. I think we'd expect some very, very robust recruiting. But I don't think that
recruiting line in itself is a big driver of short-term business development expenses.

Operator: Thank you for your question. Next, we have a question from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.
Please go ahead, sir.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Harris Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks, guys. So, really strong quarter for investment banking, you highlighted that. Can you guys maybe unpack
the drivers for us a little bit more and really just kind of interested to know like how broad-based the strength is
that you're seeing in investment banking or whether it's somewhat concentrated in a handful of transactions? And
then how are you feeling about the sustainability of the revenues that you're seeing in banking?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I can just tell you it's been pretty broad-based. Our largest group, tech services, and real estate have continued to
perform well, it continued to perform well. And I think their backlogs are very strong as well as the banking across
all of our sectors, which you can see from the industry is up. So, I would say our top-performing sectors have
continued to outperform and the other sectors are having good years also. So, it's pretty broad-based. And if you
look at backlog for – backlog is not any good, most of the deal closes, it's very, very strong.
So, again, we've seen deals shut off and we've seen deals accelerate. And I don't know if there'll be a rush at the
end of the year if there's a presidential and congressional changes, and anticipated tax rate changes, whether
that rushes deals to close at year end. So, it's just hard to tell. But I can just tell you the activity is broad-based.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Harris Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And just a quick follow-up for Paul Shoukry. I know there's a lot of moving parts to loan portfolio. You
want to be selective with C&I, but you could potentially see some growth in other areas. Maybe you'll sell some
more loans, maybe not. Given all of that, could we potentially see growth in the loan portfolio for fiscal 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
All right. I think it's possible especially depending on the growth in the Private Client Group loans, securities-
based loans. I think we hope to still continue growing that over 10% and the mortgage growth has been pretty
15


Raymond James Financial, Inc.
(RJF) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
strong as well. So, that's certainly possible. I think what we're trying to do going forward is if you look at the slide
that shows the combined interest – net interest income and the BDP fees from third-party banks, because you
have to really look at it on a combined basis.
What we're hoping is that this quarter, I hate to call it trough because you never know, but certainly the short-term
rates have sort of been fully reflected in the loan portfolio. All the floating rate loans almost all of them have reset.
And so we hope to grow that number from this point forward assuming cash balances remain relatively resilient at
the current level.
So, that's the hope. But again, if we don't grow loans this year as much as we can given our capacity for cash and
capital capacity, then that'll just give us more dry powder for the next year. And we're going to grow loans when
we're – especially the corporate loans, when we're comfortable with the sort of economic environment and the
lack of certainty. There's less uncertainty than there is now. And we're looking at this. We're making long-term
decisions.
So, if it takes two years to get to that level of comfort, then we'll have more dry powder then, and that rate of
growth will be higher then if we don't grow it as much this year. So, we're going to be patient and make the best
decision based on what we know in the economic environment. [indiscernible] (00:51:15).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
We are starting to see some [ph] corporate (00:51:19) opportunities that look like decent spreads and some [ph]
flow (00:51:23) and some – you go through cycles. And so, whether that continues or strengthens, I don't know.
But again, we're – I agree with Paul, we're going to be cautious on those. We are staying on the flow and looking
at those opportunities.

Global. Please go ahead.

James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Maybe just a question up on the recruiting a little bit more detail, if you could just sort of share
where you're seeing the growth. It does seem broad-based. But is there any kind of geographic concentration? Is
it mostly from the wirehouses still? And maybe a little bit of an update on sort of the West Coast where I think
you've been – have the least amount of penetration, how is that thing going in terms of ramping that up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
So, the color on recruiting, it's – we looked, and recruiting is great across all of our affiliation options from
employee independent to the RIA channel. So, we've been very pleased that the growth in all three. I'd say
recruiting has been broad-based as much as we focus southwest where we've continued to gain momentum.
There's still a lot of recruiting going in places where we're strong like the midwest and other areas.
So, that's very broad-based. The wirehouses continue to be the primary contributor to our recruiting pipeline,
although there are other firms really through periods of time also get [indiscernible] (00:53:08), but it's mainly
wirehouse-driven. And the recruiting outlook looks very, very good and [ph] like for a minute joined (00:53:16)
pipeline looks very strong.

And again, a part of that is due to deferrals, especially the employee channels. Our branches have been closed.
They're open now. But a lot of the folks during that period of time didn't want to move into a closed branch. So,
the employees lagged a little bit in independent channel during this last year. But we're seeing activity across all
the channels there.

James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just on – second question on the investment banking business. Obviously, it's
strong, pipeline strong. Is that an area that you're investing in to grow or is this just kind of reaping a good
environment? Just trying to get a sense of what you think of sort of the organic or market share growth that you
might be targeting in across investment banking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I'm sorry you guys haven't noticed the investment because we have a lot of focus on growing the M&A business,
acquiring a firm in Europe which is done terrific a few years ago that's really added to our cross border, adding a
lot of very, very senior bankers, in healthcare and other areas, and looking at boutiques and tuck-ins.
And so, I think both the environment is good. That's true. Earnings releases by everybody. But the reason that our
numbers were so good is we've invested in the bankers that made a big difference and we'll continue to, so –
especially in M&A where we are probably undersized given our size and our great capital market strength. We'll
continue to invest, particularly in that area. And hopefully, given the rest of the business and our good research,
we can continue to grow that.

Most have been asked here, but just a couple kind of clean up. So, first one on just the election next week and
then trying to think about some of the considerations to the extent there is an administration change and I
appreciate there's a lot of nuance in terms of what happens there. But are there any regulatory items that you're
kind of focused on in an administration change, whether it'd be the potential for more onerous rule out to the
17


Raymond James Financial, Inc.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
SEC's Reg BI? I'm not sure if it did well. Could [ph] reinsert itself of (00:56:07) that, that's in all in the conversation
or state, specifically you could feel more emboldened to disrupt kind of where the industry is moving towards. I'm
curious if there's any kind of chatter of that. And then just more broadly, thinking about the potential for higher tax
rates and any businesses that you guys feel like that could impact for you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, Devin, it's complicated. So, first, the world always seems to turn when parties change. So, despite the
changes, we have to – we all compete in the same environment. So, we feel very comfortable competing in
whatever that environment is. So, I think if there is a congressional and presidential party changes, certainly taxes
are the ones that will be – I mean I'm thinking most businesses shouldn't have a huge impact. Businesses will go
on. Our tax credit business will probably benefit from it. The higher the tax rate, more value of those credits. And I
think [indiscernible] (00:57:09) helping. Will still be targeted for the administration. So, think relative unless tax
rates go totally crazy, but the world will go on.
So, regulatory, we always monitor regulatory change and even with a – what is considered a business-friendly
White House, we've got some pretty big regulatory changes with the Reg BI. And so I think you're talking about
matters of degree. And could there be tweaks to that? Yes. It doesn't look like the number one – top one with the
credit nominee with the regulatory reform. So, it really more accounts to who's put into [indiscernible] (00:57:57)
office.
And a number of the key ones that people are in those positions for a couple of years. Even at the elections, they
usually set the tone on enforcement and other things. So, I don't think there's going to be a short-term impact no
matter what the election is. Longer term, certainly there could be.
So, I think it's all speculation. We were – the states we – you always worry about individual states because it
makes the business very complex, but most of those changes [indiscernible] (00:58:32) not come forward. That
depends. Major impacts to our business. So, it's an unknown, but we'll compete in whatever the environment is
and whatever the rules are.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks, Paul. And just to follow up here. Just want to [indiscernible] (00:58:52) kind of the expense
conversation, and just make sure that we're fully appreciating all moving parts. So, I guess first and foremost, is
the valuation that you guys referenced last quarter, is that now complete with all the changes and some of the
detail that you provided here, and then obviously the reduction in force? Or are there more things that you're
looking at internally that could also move the needle on the expense trajectory from this point? And then, also, I
just want to make sure that it doesn't feel like there's probably any big revenue considerations from [indiscernible]
(00:59:30), but just want to make sure that we're understanding that as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
So, I'd say that, first, [indiscernible] (00:59:37) not signing anymore. So, I mean – so, last time we really had any
kind of reduction in force was after [indiscernible] (00:59:46) a couple of years after the [indiscernible] (00:59:49)
acquisition where we did a small one, but we waited a couple years trying to get everybody employed. So, I think
that's behind us. So, there's nothing of that size.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Any first shift on the AFS portfolio? Wondering if you could help
us understand where currently investment rates are with an average three-year duration that's still fitting just
under 100 basis points. And secondly, I wonder if you were able to start opportunistic buybacks later this year.
Does that change your desire to allocate capital to growing that AFS portfolio at this pace?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, Kyle, you're right on with your kind of estimate on the yield. It's right around just under 1% for sort of the
three-year type duration. And in terms of the decision whether to buy back shares or grow the portfolio, we have
enough capital frankly to do both if we are comfortable doing both. So, we have a lot of capacity and flexibility and
certainly the ability to do both just as we have been over the last couple years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And just on the cash balances, I mean those continue to grow quite nicely. Just wondering if you can just
provide an update maybe on a long-term target for the percentage of those balances or how you're thinking about
the percentage of balances that you're comfortable migrating to the balance sheet over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I get a lot of variables in terms of the capital, the returns that we were getting on, the assets of refunding
with the cash. And frankly, what the demand is from third-party banks, which was very high in March when these
banks were seeing revolver draws. They needed the cash to cover those draws. And since then, there was – a lot
of those revolver draws have been paid back and the banking system is generally flushed with cash right now.
So, we are on a net basis seeing some banks still want that cash. But on a net basis, the demand is diminishing.
So, that's really the benefit of having a bank in our business, is it gives us a lot of flexibility. And if the demand
19


Raymond James Financial, Inc.
(RJF) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
from third-party banks continue to diminish and things continue to recover in the economy and we have good risk-
adjusted returns and the assets of the bank and invest then, then we would be comfortable putting in a large
portion of those cash balances on the balance sheet so long as it doesn't compromise the client's ability to get the
maximum FDIC coverage. We're one of the few firms that offer up to $3 million for a joint account of FDIC
coverage through our waterfall program. And so, it gives us a lot of flexibility to continue growing the balance
sheet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yes. And then lastly for me, and I'll leave it there. I just [indiscernible] (01:03:38) question, the reduction in force.
Should we expect any additional one-time charges this quarter? And I know you said it will impact the admin line
within PCG. Just wondering what other segments we could see some level of impact on the computation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, we took the vast, vast majority of the associated expense in that $46 million this quarter. So, I don't think
that there'll be any meaningful numbers kind of going forward related to the reduction in force in terms of costs.
And then in terms of – PGG is our largest business. Most of the support cost, control cost, risk management cost
gets allocated to PCG. But I think the reduction was fairly broad-based in terms of the businesses. So, I think
you'll just see it on a consolidated basis in the administrative compensation line item in each business. But Private
Client Group business is by far the largest consumer of that administrative expense.

Chris Allen Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Good morning, guys. Two quick ones. One, I'm wondering if the – if you've seen any changes [ph] comparing it
(01:05:04) to the recruiting environment just given some of the commentaries you heard from some of the big
banks and ideally some of them getting a little more aggressive on packages. Wondering if you're seeing any
change there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I'd say that, first, everyone – since I've been in this job, everybody asked that question and it's always
competitive, right? So, sometimes players change, sometimes even people say they're getting out of the market,
recruiting, make it out for a quarter or two and they're right back in. So, it's always been competitive. And firms
change or firms that have done better who paying a lot of money relative to what we pay for transitional
assistance. And I think we've kind of kept our great balance of being fair to the people coming over and having
them come over for the environment. So, we get outbid sometimes, yeah. But that's not new for us.

But what we believe is we offer the best home and the best tools and the best platform. So, it's competitive out
there. And sometimes, it's more competitive in the independent channels. People get aggressive. The employee
channel I think in this last quarter too, people have really kind of been more aggressive in what they're willing to
pay. And we continue to sell our long-term value proposition. So, it's always competitive. And we've done pretty
good at this for a long time now. So, we're keeping our focus and very happy with the great teams we're bringing
in.

Chris Allen Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah, and just another quick one. I saw a news article just in terms of you reorganized the [ph] cluster (01:06:46)
division just combining the broker, dealer and hybrid [indiscernible] (01:06:48) custody units. I'm just wondering if
that was done as looking more – to be more offensive just given the merger for – with [indiscernible] (01:06:58)
Ameritrade and [indiscernible] (01:06:59) on E*TRADE just in terms of the opportunity around the RIA custodial.
Any color there would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. It's a focused area of growth for us and we've had that division for a long time. We felt that eventually with
enough regulatory change, I think BI was one of the – I think acceleration of movement, which we saw before
June 30 and somewhat slowing down now. But the RIA channel has been the fastest growing percentage wise in
the industry for a long time. So, the move was really just to consolidate the scale of the businesses, the custodial
business and they're much more related than they're not. So, we want to combine to make sure that we have
more size and scale to focus on that for management there.

Thanks, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. I'll now turn the presentation back to Mr. Reilly to continue for his concluding remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, thank you all, for joining us. So, we know it's harder jobs are like ours are predicting what's going to happen.
Remember, a lot of years where we could just kind of draw a line and look at trends and be pretty much tell you
what was going to happen. And certainly, that's not this environment right now. So, we'll try to give you as much
guidance as we can when we think we can see it. We don't want to make up numbers or make up things just to
help you put in the model that don't have a base.
So, I think with the outlook, it's more difficult. Having said that, I think you can see the commitment to expense
reduction that we've talked about. You can see it coming through last year. It certainly is better this year. And we
are really focused on growth. We've still been focused on growth. And the one thing if you could really manage
your expenses and continue to grow, you get pretty good financial results. So, we think long term, we're doing the
right thing. We've got to focus. And as we get more clarity, we'll try to give it to you, and hopefully happen now,
let's say soon, we can give you good – better targets than we could in the middle of this. Hopefully, not a bad
second wave of the pandemic.
