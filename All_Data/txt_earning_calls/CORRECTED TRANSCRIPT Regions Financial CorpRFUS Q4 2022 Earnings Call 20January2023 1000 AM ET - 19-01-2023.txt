Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. John and David will provide high-
level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement
disclaimer and non-GAAP information, are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These

John M. Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Let me begin by saying
that we're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. Earlier this morning, we reported full-year
earnings of $2.1 billion, reflecting record pre-tax pre-provision income of $3.1 billion, adjusted positive operating
leverage of 7%, and industry leading returns on both average tangible common equity and total shareholder
returns.
Our results speak to and underscore the comprehensive work that's taken place over the past decade to position
the company to generate consistent, sustainable, long-term performance. We have enhanced our credit, interest
rate and operational risk management processes and platforms while sharpening our focus on risk-adjusted
returns and capital allocation.
We made investments in markets, technology, talent and capabilities to diversify our revenue base and enhance
our offerings to customers. For example, investments in our Treasury Management products and services led to
record revenue this year. Similarly, our Wealth Management segment also generated record revenue despite
volatile market conditions. And now we're seeing positive results of our comprehensive strategy. Over the course
of the year, we grew revenue and average loans while prudently managing expenses, further illustrating the
successful execution of our strategic plan.
So, as we enter 2023, it is from a position of strength. Our business customers have strong balance sheets. They
have benefited from population migration, and many continue to carry more liquidity than in the past.
Our Consumer customer base remains healthy. Deposit balances remain strong and credit card payments remain
elevated. The job market continues to be solid, with approximately two open jobs available for each unemployed
person across the Regions footprint.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
We have a robust credit risk management framework and a disciplined and dynamic approach to managing
concentration risk. Our portfolios are more balanced and diverse than at any point in the past. We have a strong
balance sheet that's well-positioned to perform an array of economic conditions. We have solid capital and
liquidity position to support balance sheet growth and strategic investments.
And most importantly, we have a solid strategic plan, an outstanding team and a proven track record of
successful execution. So, as we look ahead, although there is uncertainty, we feel good about how we're
positioned.
Now David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average loans increased 1% sequentially, or 9% year-over-
year. Average business loans increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting high-quality, broad-based
growth. Average consumer loans declined 1% as growth in mortgage, EnerBank and credit card was offset by the
strategic sale of consumer loans late in the third quarter and continued runoff of exit portfolios. Looking forward,
we expect 2023 ending loan growth of approximately 4%.
From a deposit standpoint, as expected, deposits continued to normalize during the quarter, consistent with a
rapidly rising rate environment. Average total consumer balances were modestly lower, primarily driven by higher-
balance customers seeking marginal investment alternatives. Meanwhile, the median consumer balance remains
relatively stable, still about 50% above pre-pandemic levels.
Normalization was more pronounced in the average corporate and commercial deposits, which were down 2%
during the quarter. As anticipated, our business clients continued to optimize the level and structure of their
liquidity position. We experienced remixing away from noninterest-bearing deposits to other options both on- and
off-balance sheet, including those offered through our Treasury Management platform.
Ending deposit balances have declined approximately $7 billion year-over-year, in line with our previously
provided 2022 expectations. Looking forward, we do anticipate further deposit declines of approximately $3 billion
to $5 billion in the first half of 2023, reflecting continued Federal Reserve balance sheet normalization, seasonal
trends and late cycle rate-seeking behavior. We expect to experience stabilization of deposit balances midyear,
with the potential for modest growth in the second half of the year. Our deliberate approach to managing liquidity
allows for deposit normalization and growth in the balance sheet without the need for material wholesale
borrowings in the near term.
So, let's shift to net interest income and margin. Reflecting our asset-sensitive profile, net interest income grew to
a record $1.4 billion this quarter, representing an 11% increase, while reported net interest margin increased 46
basis points to 3.99%, its highest level in the last 15 years. While deposit repricing continues to accelerate, the
cycle-to-date beta remains low at 14%. Importantly, our guidance for 2023 assumes a 35% full cycle beta by year-
end. There is uncertainty regarding full cycle deposit betas for the industry. However, we remain confident that
our deposit composition will provide a meaningful competitive advantage.
Growth in net interest income is expected to continue until the Federal Reserve reaches the end of its tightening
cycle. Once the Fed pauses, we would expect deposit costs to continue increasing for a couple of more quarters.
This equates to 1% to 3% net interest income growth in the first quarter and 13% to 15% growth in 2023,
assuming the December 31 forward rate curve.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
Earlier in 2022, we added a meaningful amount of hedges focused on protecting 2024 and 2025. The swaps
become effective in the latter half of 2023 and 2024 and generally have a term of three years. Activity in the fourth
quarter focused on extending that protection beyond 2025. We will look for attractive opportunities to continue to
expand this protection.
We have constructed the balance sheet to support a net interest margin range of 3.6% to 4% over the coming
years even if interest rates move back towards 1%. If rates remain elevated, our reported net interest margin is
projected to surpass the high end of the range until deposits fully reprice.
So, let's take a look at the fee revenue and expense. Reported noninterest income includes $50 million of
insurance proceeds related to a third quarter regulatory settlement. Excluding that, adjusted noninterest income
declined 9% from the prior quarter, as stability in Wealth Management income and a modest increase in card and
ATM fees were offset by declines in other categories, mainly mortgage and capital markets.
Service charges declined 3% due primarily to three fewer days in the fourth quarter versus the third. We expect to
offer a grace period feature to cover overdrafts around midyear 2023, and when combined with our previously
implemented enhancements, will result in full-year service charges of approximately $550 million.
Within capital markets, increases in M&A fees were offset by declines in all other categories, including a negative
$11 million CVA and DVA adjustment. Despite an increase in servicing income, elevated interest rates and
seasonally lower production drove total mortgage income lower during the quarter. With respect to outlook, we
expect full year 2023 adjusted total revenue to be up 8% to 10% compared to 2022.
Let's move on to noninterest expense. Reported, professional and legal expenses declined significantly, driven by
charges related to the settlement of a regulatory matter in the third quarter. Excluding this and other adjusted
items, adjusted noninterest expenses increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Salaries and benefits
increased 2%, primarily due to an increase in associate head count during the fourth quarter and higher benefits
expense.
Equipment and software expenses increased 4%, reflecting increased technology investments. The fourth quarter
level does provide a reasonable quarterly run rate for 2023. We expect full year 2023 adjusted noninterest
expenses to be up 4.5% to 5.5%, and we expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage of
approximately 4%.
From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance remains broadly stable while experiencing expected
normalization. Net charge offs were 29 basis points in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the third quarter
consumer loan sale, adjusted full year net charge offs were 22 basis points. Non-performing loans remained
relatively stable quarter-over-quarter and were below pre-pandemic levels.
Provision expense was $112 million this quarter, while the allowance for credit loss ratio remained unchanged at
1.63%. The increase to the allowance was due primarily to economic conditions, normalizing credit from
historically low levels and loan growth. These increases were partially offset by the elimination of the hurricane-
related reserves established last quarter.
Just to remind you, we believe our normalized charge-offs based on our current book of business should range
from 35 to 45 basis points on an annual basis. However, due to the strength of the consumer and the businesses,
we expect our full year 2023 net charge-off ratio to be in the range of 25 to 35 basis points.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
From a capital standpoint, we ended the quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at an estimated 9.6%,
reflecting solid capital generation through earnings, partially offset by continued loan growth. Given the uncertain
economic outlook, we plan to manage capital levels near the upper end of our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range
over the near term.
So, in closing, we delivered strong results in 2022, despite volatile economic conditions. We are in some of the
strongest markets in the country. And while we remain vigilant to indicators of potential market contraction, we will
continue to be a source of stability to our customers. Pre-tax pre-provision income remains strong. Expenses are
well controlled. Credit remains broadly stable, and capital and liquidity are solid.
Now, with that, we'll move to the Q&A portion of the call.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank
you. Our first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Hi, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
In terms of your deposit beta, regarding that 35% data assumption by year end 2023, what is your – maybe help
us think about what your assumption is around noninterest-bearing mix as a percentage of total deposits? How do
you see that trending through the year? What's underlying that assumption? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. John, it's David. So, what we did, we're at 39% noninterest bearing right now. We've always had more
noninterest bearing than most everybody. That's just the nature of our deposit base. We said we would continue
to see deposit run-off this year somewhere in the $3 billion to $5 billion range. And for our guidance, we've taken
all that out of NIB. So, you should expect that percentage of NIB to decline somewhat during the year. Now, that's
just what we put in the guide. We could see some mix changes from that NIB and maybe that's the most harsh it
could be, so that's why we put it in the guide. So, I don't know if there's a follow-up there, but.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. No, that's helpful. And I think that the color on the beta provides some of the additional detail. But just
separately, if I could just hop over to credit for my follow-up. The – can you give us a little bit of color around what
6

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
drove the increase in charge-offs in the quarter? It looks like that may have been in C&I, but want to get a little bit
of color around what you're seeing there. Are you seeing any stresses in certain pockets of your loan categories
that you're watching that are starting to generate some losses? And then also what drove the 14% increase in the
criticized loans? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, John. This is John. So, we did see a little uptick in business services charge-offs in the quarter related to a
handful of credits. We've identified couple areas or a couple segments of the portfolio, where we see elevated
stress at the office, healthcare, consumer discretionary, senior housing, and transportation, on the small end of
trucking in particular, we're seeing elevated levels of – or elevating levels, I should say, of classified loans in
particular.
So, to the second part of your question, we are seeing some normalization in the portfolio. Classified loans are
increasing toward levels that we would expect to be more "normalized". And the categories in which that – we're
seeing that change are the five identified. But there are some odds and ends in the portfolio as well as inflationary
impacts and rising rates affect isolated customers. In general, we still feel very good about credit quality, and as
David said, we're guiding to 25 to 35 basis points of charge-offs in 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
And, John, I'll add, if you look at page 19, we tried to help you with the areas that John just mentioned in terms of
the higher-risk segments. And you can see on that page the strength of the allowance to cover those increases in
the criticized level that we have listed in the supplement. And we don't necessarily have loss and everyone those
– that migrated into criticized but what we do see, we have already embedded in the reserve and it's factored in,
as John mentioned, in our guidance of 25 to 35 basis points in charge-offs for 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Yeah. Thanks, David. I appreciate that. If I could just ask one more on that. On the reserves, you pretty much kept
it stable this quarter. Can you maybe discuss the likelihood of incremental builds here or do you think it fairly
represents the scenarios of outlook that you're looking at here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, we certainly believe it represents what we think is the loss content that exists today. Obviously, every
quarter we have to reassess the economy, the quality of the portfolio at those times. So, we think we have it
covered. The only bill that you would see from this standpoint that we know of would be related to new loan
growth. And we're going to have some of that. We said we would grow loans about 4% end-to-end during the
year. So, we'll need to provide for that. But we think at 1.63% is a good coverage ratio for the risk that we have in
our portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Based on our current economic assumption.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, good morning, guys. I just want to follow up on the funding side of the balance sheet. Can you talk a little bit
about – you guys have had that ability to just keep your loan-to-deposit ratio in a good spot. And just wondering if
you kind of help us understand what you expect to do over time in terms of your wholesale debt footprint,
including long-term debt, and what that would imply then for what you expect to do with the securities book over
time as well. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we continue to have one of the lowest loan-to-deposit ratios. I think you were leading to that. We're in
great markets. We continue to work on growing accounts, whether it be checking accounts or operating accounts.
That's the hallmark of our whole franchise is the strength of that deposit base. So, we will continue to leverage
that deposit base in terms of our funding mix, at least for the first half of the year. We don't see the need to go into
any wholesale borrowings. We have plenty of access to that should we need it. Most of our peers, I think, have all
tapped wholesale funding already. So, we're being able to leverage that, and that's where we give you the pretty
strong guide in terms of our NII growth for the year of 13% to 15%.
So, we'll see what the deposit flows are. As we mentioned to John earlier, the deposit outflows we see that we put
in our guide is $3 billion to $5 billion. Now, remember, we said $5 billion to $10 billion. This past year, we were at
$7 billion. So we've been estimating it pretty well, and we've taken to offer our guide all of that out of NIB. So, we'll
see what happens during the year, but don't expect us to be looking for wholesale funding until at least the
second half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q

Okay. And then just to follow up, you're going to do that grace period, and we saw you reiterate the $550 million of
service charges. Can you just kind of just give an update on the state of the consumer there and behavioral
changes and any other learnings and findings that kind of continue to make you confident in upholding that $550
million zone of service charges? Thanks.

John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, Ken, we continue to see consumers maintaining good deposit balance levels. Spending is up
modestly, but we think being managed very carefully by our consumer customer base, we feel good about the
health of the consumer overall.
With respect to overdrafts and the changes that we've made to benefit customers, we've seen about a 20%
decline in the number of customers who are overdrawing their accounts on a month-to-month basis, which we are
happy about. Ultimately, the objective is to help customers better manage their finances. And so, I would say, all
in all, we feel good about our guide and good about the impact that the changes that we've made have had on our
consumer customer base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, Ken. Let me add that embedded in the service charges is Treasury Management. And Treasury
Management has had a fantastic year. If you look at the fourth quarter for Treasury Management, we were up 7%
fourth quarter of 2022 to fourth quarter 2021. And if you look at the entire year, we were up 9% in TM. So, that's
been a positive to us. It's helped bolster that downward trend of service charges due to all the account changes
that we've made and will be a strength for us going into 2023. It gives us confidence, as John mentioned, that we
can meet the $550 million in service charges for the year.

question.

John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Morning, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Just a big picture strategic question, obviously, you've done an amazing job growing net interest
income and getting the rate call right. It seems like three for three here. But, I guess, the flip side is the kind of
revenue mix has become more dependent on rates and the balance sheet, right, as you think about the fee
composition. So, anyway, long story short, the question is, what strategic opportunities do you have to grow the
fee revenues and maybe something that's more from an acquisition point of view to accelerate that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, we've been, as you know, active making non-bank acquisitions, particularly adding to our capital markets
capabilities. And we're pleased with – despite the fact that we had a bit of a soft quarter in the fourth quarter,
really pleased with the contribution that those capital markets investments are making to help us continue to
9

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
strengthen relationships with customers and grow noninterest revenues up pretty dramatically over the last six or
seven years.
Likewise, we are excited about the investments we've made on the consumer side, whether it be the acquisition of
Ascentium Capital, which is part of our Corporate Banking Group, EnerBank, which gives us a chance to grow
loans to homeowners, mortgage servicing rights that we've acquired, which have been helpful.
And then in the wealth space, we've made some acquisitions that have been modestly incremental, helpful to us,
and we continue to look for opportunities there as well. So, we are, I think, positioning ourselves as we continue to
accrete capital to making additional investments as we see those opportunities arise. We're consistently looking
and I think you can look for us to continue to try to build on the investments that we've already made.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Matt, let me add that – so, the fact that we've been able to grow NIIs is actually a positive thing. We
recognize it does lower the percentage of noninterest revenues in total, but we're very proud of the fact that we've
been able to manage our balance sheet in this manner. More importantly, we're trying to take the volatility out of
that line item. And so, if you look at our ability to hedge, we're locking in what we believe to be a very strong
margin range of 3.60% to 3.90% over time regardless of what the rate environment does. And so, that gives us a
lot of stability there.
And if that means we have higher NII and the percentage of NIR is a bit lower than they've historically been, we're
okay with that. To John's point, we are going to look to use our capital for some non-bank acquisitions like you
have seen us do, nothing too big, but just to bolster the NIR strength to make us more resilient in just about any
environment that we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Understood. That's helpful. And then just somewhat related, I've been asking a lot of your peers the same
question, but you all seem to be building capital kind of well beyond what I would have thought that you would
need. And you've talked about kind of the upper end to 9.25% – 9.75% CET1, and that's not new. But I guess the
question is, why are you and others potentially all building what seems to be well in excess of what you need for
CCAR? Are you anticipating something from CCAR changing? Is there kind of pressure behind the scenes from
rating agencies, regulators, or are just all the banks deciding on their own to be a little more conservative given
the cycle where we are? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, Matt, we can't speak for the other banks. I would say, for us, it is a bit of an uncertain time. We think
there potentially are opportunities to continue to make non-bank acquisitions will arise. We were fortunate enough
to make three in a short period of time at the end of 2021. And just operating at the upper end of our range gives
us some flexibility. And we'd like to continue to maintain that given the uncertain environment that we're operating
in.

And if you look at CCAR degradation in capital was one of the lowest in the peer group. So, we don't need capital
to take care of the risk, embedded in our balance sheet is really opportunistic opportunities we're looking for. And
frankly having a little bit more capital, Matt, doesn't hurt us from a return standpoint. We generated over 30%
return on tangible common equity and so having upper end of the 9.75% won't impact in any meaningful way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. A couple of questions. One, just on the loan growth outlook, I know you indicated you expect ending balance
to be about 4% up year-on-year. Could you just give us a sense as to how you're thinking through the dynamics of
which pieces of the loan growth are likely to accelerate, be on the high side, lower side, and then how much
longer that run-off portfolio is going to impact the numbers? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we expect loan growth to slow just with general economy slowing. I think our growth opportunities will
manifest itself in the corporate banking group, commercial and corporate banking as line utilization likely goes up
a bit. I think there will be some opportunities in the real estate. We did have some growth of real estate, primarily
multi-family, still happy with that. And we do have one of the lowest concentrations of investor real estate
compared to the peer groups. But we look at utilizing our capital selectively with the right customers, doing the
right things, in particular, like I said, multi-family.
On the consumer side, our EnerBank acquisition we had in the end of 2021, as John mentioned, is doing well for
us. We're looking for that to have opportunities to continue to grow. And mortgage, while it's going to be
challenging again in 2023 because of the rate environment, although it's settled back a bit, it will give us some
opportunity to grow a bit in consumer side.
As you mentioned, we do have some run-off portfolios. Our last one – probably by the time we get to the end of
this year, we're probably not having a discussion about exit portfolios anymore.

Yeah. I would just add, despite the fact that we expect the small business customer to be under some pressure in
more challenged economy, we're seeing real opportunity through the Ascentium Capital platform, making loans to
businesses on business essential equipment. We're able to leverage that platform, which is very specialized in
nature through our branch system in our existing customer base. And over 35% plus of our branches in 2022
originated loan through Ascentium Capital. We'll see more of that grow I think and again, another opportunity to
leverage an acquisition into our existing customer base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. That was going to be one of my follow-ups, just trying to understand Ascentium in this dynamic and the
driver that it is for you. And I guess the underlying question here is, is it – what's the average size of this loan, an
Ascentium loan? Is it more of a small business size or medium or maybe give us some color around that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. It is a small business. It's loans originated on equipment that is, as I said, business essentials. So, the
thesis is that that business owner is likely to pay that loan first because he has to have – he or she has to have
the equipment to operate the business. The average sized loan is about $75,000, and the term would be three to
four years on average.

Okay, great. And then just lastly, follow-up on the funding question that came up earlier, I mean, we're hearing
from others that borrowing from federal home loan banks is interesting even though the base rate sticker price
might look a little higher, you obviously get some dividend back from the swap, you also get the fact that you don't
have to pay the FDIC. So, I'm just wondering, is it at all attractive to you at some point to lean in more there or
not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, I think we'll need to evaluate with that closure when we get to the point where we needed. We still have
opportunities. We've had a $2 billion to $3 billion worth of corporate deposits that are moved off our balance sheet
to seek higher rates that we weren't willing to pay. Those are our customers. We own their – still have their
operating account. They've just moved their excess cash elsewhere. So, there is an opportunity to go back to
those customers first before we need to seek other wholesale funding. But I think we have all avenues. We have
term debt, too, that can help us with the FDIC as well. We'll just have to evaluate the total cost of all of our
opportunities at that time, which as I said earlier, is really going to be in the second half of the year.

your question.

John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning, Stephen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning. So, it's hard to pick apart anything in this quarter, results were fantastic. I guess the one question I
get from people is as we start to see maybe some normalization in credit is how do you really highlight for folks
how much different your franchise is today versus pre-cycle ? I know you've laid some of that out in mid-quarter
presentations, the shift to investment grade and so forth. But how would you combat that pushback from some
folks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think balance and diversity is the first thing I would point to. When you look at pre-Great Recession, our
balance sheet, whether it be on the right side or the left side, assets or liabilities, we had concentrations in certain
asset classes and we were very dependent on interest-bearing deposits for funding. If you look at the reshaping
of our balance sheet over time, our – the liability side of our balance sheet, I think, is really strong and provides,
as we've talked about to this point, the foundation for our outperformance, and we expect that will continue.
On the asset side of the balance sheet, we have only – less than 10% of our outstandings are in investor real
estate. That's down significantly from pre-crisis levels. And we also, I think, have been very, very committed to
concentration risk management. We have a very active and ongoing credit risk management process, which we
believe will produce much better results than we have previously delivered. We're committed to consistent,
sustainable, long-term performance, and that requires that we manage credit risk well. At the end of the day, I
know we've got to deliver and we intend to do that, but we think we're well-positioned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
I would add that we also developed, not too long ago, a new tool. We call it [ph] R Click (00:35:15), which doesn't
mean anything to you. But what it does is it analyzes the cash flows of each of our customers. And we built that
and developed that tool to give us an idea of a product and service that a customer may need from us that they
don't have. What we found is it gave us such good information on cash flows every month that it gave us an
earlier indicator of potential credit stress. And that's part of what you're seeing when you see us move things into
criticized categories. We can be more proactive because we have better information to manage credit risk
management through that tool.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. That's extremely helpful. And maybe just one other question for me there is loan growth, the 4% guide, I
completely respect, all the shifts and concerns in the environment that may take that down there. But you put up
11% growth this quarter. Utilizations continue to increase. Where could you outperform that 4%, I guess, if the
environment maybe wasn't as bad as we might fear? And how do you think about that shift you've talked about
into capital markets, and what could really drive that, pushing some of those customers back into that space?

John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
So, we're currently modeling about $2 billion, I think, in credit outstanding that could move back – could move off
the balance sheet if capital markets open. That's a rough number, but that's – give you some indication of a
"headwind" if the capital markets do open. So, that could be a plus or minus to answer your question, and I think
would be the one area where we probably would see more growth than we anticipated if that did not happen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Our line utilization still below historical levels. Every 1 point increases about $600 million in outstanding.
So, if we get people drawing on their lines, perhaps that could be helpful. We'll see what the rate environment
looks like with regards to mortgage. We'll see what the economy looks like for consumers to improve their home
and leverage EnerBank. So, there are some opportunities for us to outperform those numbers if the economy kind
of continues along its current path, it's still fairly healthy and inflation's coming down. So, I think we have some
opportunity to outperform there.

Yeah, the specific page on 17, on the right-hand side, we're talking about those customers that had less than
$1,000 in their account. And that compared to the end of 2019, we have – they have six times the balances. A big
driver is that cohort was the recipient of a lot of stimulus. That stimulus could have come in the form of absolute
transfer payments. It could have come in the form of minimum wage increases. Those are permanent. So, what
we've seen is that our customers actually are making more money and they're keeping it – they're keeping their
spending under control, even though we have inflationary pressures.
So, that cohort has had more wage growth than most everybody else. And we don't see it going away. We're a bit
surprised and we're watching it every month to see if there's a change. But I think the slide was fairly consistent
with what we showed you last quarter as well. So, from a – you're really talking about just the consumer on page
17, but business customers continue to have more liquidity as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q

I got it. So, the wage growth, they're having better wage growth than most people on this call then, right, David?

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Moving on to slide 19, in the high-risk industry segments, a couple of questions, one, can you share with us – and
maybe you addressed this already in the earlier comments on the slide, but in the office space, is it mostly the
Class B and C that – or Class B that you're more focused on than Class A? And then, second, could there be
other industry segments that could show up in this slide 6 months from now or 12 months from now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Gerard, I'd say with respect to your question on office, that would be accurate. We're focused on, let's say,
the non-Class A. 82% of our portfolio is Class A. 63% is in the Sunbelt. About 36% of our portfolio is single tenant.
So, the portion that we are concerned about would be Class B space. A good percentage of it is also in suburban
markets, 74%, I think, in suburban markets.
In terms of industries or segments that we have some concern about, I would say that we're still watching senior
housing closely. I think it's performed okay post-pandemic, but an area that we had some concern about rising
cost, availability of labor, things that impact that particular segment. And then consumer discretionary, as people
continue to feel the pressure of rising costs, and/or the uncertainty in the environment, we think that – and as
unemployment begins to moderate a bit, we think that consumer discretionary is an area that could be impacted.

Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first one, I was hoping you could provide a little bit
more details on, I guess, at slide 7, in one of those footnotes, specifically how the $40 million security hedge
benefit in the fourth quarter will, and I'll put in quotes there, "migrates to loan yield", as those hedges on loans
mature. And I guess from a high level, trying to make sure I understand the impact of that $6 billion-plus hedge on
securities that matured last quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure. So, what we did at the end of December of 2021 is we wanted to add some more sensitivity to the
fourth quarter. We had some hedges that were maturing in that fourth quarter that received fixed swaps, but we
wanted to move that and have those effectively terminate a quarter earlier. We could have torn those up, but it
would have taken a lot of effort to do so because there are a bunch of small notionals in there and the cost and
time to do that, really there's an easier way to do it, which is we purchased a pay-fixed swap for that quarter. And
so, when that sensitivity came back, it generated about $40 million in the quarter.
Now, our sensitivity naturally comes back in the first quarter because we have received fixed swaps that are
maturing right at the end of the year. So, that sensitivity came back naturally in the first quarter and that's why you
won't see a decline due to this $40 million that we had in the fourth quarter. That is also why we've been able to
give you guidance that we're going to grow NII in the first quarter, somewhere between 1% and 3%. So, it's not a
cliff. You don't need to worry about having a cliff effect for it. Does that make sense?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
It does. Yeah. Then as a follow-up, and I don't mean to be too cute, but I've had a few people ask me, if I look at
your 1Q and full year 2023 NII guide, does – is the fourth quarter appears lower than the first quarter. So, maybe
could you just talk about kind of the trajectory of NII as you think about it today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, we've given you guide for the year of 13% to 15% up. We've also given you a guide from the fourth quarter
to the first quarter growth of 1% to 3%. Now obviously, there's more pressure as after the Fed stops raising rates
for a quarter or two, you're going to see deposit cost continue. They lag. So, you're going to continue to see
pressure after that. It's going to affect everybody in the industry that way.
And so, you'll see that decline at some point quarter-over-quarter during the year. So, that's why it's harder just to
extrapolate fourth quarter. But we'll see where the Fed goes. We're – our guidance is predicated on the
December forwards. If that changes and – we'll come back and update our outlook. But that gives you enough
information to be able to model and do your sensitivities. But yeah, there will be some declines in NII based on
the forwards sometime during 2023.

Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
I had a follow-up on capital. You guys had a nice bump up in ratios this quarter. And just given the loan growth
outlook you're talking about, it seems like you'll be at the top end of that target range for CET1 by the end of 1Q. I
know the buyback hasn't been a big priority for you recently, but at what point do you think that it might make
sense to turn it back on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, as we think of capital allocation, before I get there, let me point out one thing. We do have the impact of
the regulatory change that will hit us in this first quarter, as everybody. That's about 10 basis points working the
other way.
So – but your question is broader. How do we think about capital allocation, including repurchases? So, first off,
we want to use our capital to support our loan growth. We want to pay a dividend in the 35% to 45% range. We've
been at the low end of that, so we would like to operate over time and at least in the middle of that. We want to
use some of our capital for non-bank acquisitions, in particular to bolster our noninterest revenue as we
discussed, I forgot who asked that question.
17


Regions Financial Corp.
(RF) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
And then, the kind of – we use the share repurchase as the toggle, would keep our capital where we want it to be,
which we said would be at the upper end of our range of 9.75%. We just think that's prudent with uncertainty –
overly negatively affect our return. So, if we go meaningfully over that, we could turn on share repurchases, and
we'll just have to see how that – the capital generation should be very strong in 2023, and we have should have
enough to do all things I mentioned. And if we can't put our capital to work doing a non-bank acquisition, then we'll
give it back to the shareholders.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. Appreciate the color there. And then back on the $3 billion to $5 billion deposit run-off outlook you talked
about earlier, I was glad to hear you – you seem to go conservative with – assuming all of that run-off was in
noninterest-bearing deposits. I was curious regarding the big picture what you're seeing in the book that gets you
to that $3 billion to $5 billion range. And how sensitive is that to a stronger move up in Fed funds if we end up
seeing that? And then how are you thinking about funding that run-off, if that's going to come from the securities
book, which is lower rate, or if you're assuming some of that or most of that comes out of cash at this point in your
NII book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, we have plenty of cash right now to take care of that run-off. So, that's not big deal. That $3 billion to $5
billion, there's some corporate changes in there that'll be seeking rates. There's some consumer changes that are
seeking rates.
Historically, movements like this happen late cycle. So, we're getting there. We all think that we're getting towards
the end of the cycle. And so, people will look to capture that upside so they can lock in the best rate before rates
start going the other way.
So, how much conservatism we have in there, we'll see. We had a pretty big run-up in deposits, $40 billion during
the pandemic. And we're holding on to quite a bit of that, more so than we originally thought. But I think it'd be
prudent to – we think it's prudent to put in this run-off of $3 billion to $5 billion and again conservatively all in NIB.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
Good morning. Morning. Could you speak to concerns that we could see the mix of time deposits and noninterest-
bearing deposits return potentially not just to pre-COVID levels but back to pre-GFC levels in this environment?
You've given a lot of great detail on the strength of your deposit franchise, but it'd be great to hear your thoughts
on sort of that risk both broadly at the industry level and more specifically for Regions as we look at from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, you're breaking up a little bit. But I think what your question was, is how we think about time deposits
versus noninterest-bearing deposits and where will we settle out over time. So, we're sitting here today at 39%
noninterest-bearing. There have been some movements out of that to – from – because we were over 40% into
CDs. So, we do believe there's going to be some remixing. That's built into our beta assumption of 35% through
the end of the year.
We still think we'll have more NIB than most everybody because that's the nature of our deposit book. Very
granular deposits, in particular on the consumer side, where we have leading primacy and that makes the
difference. So, money goes in, money goes out. They're not seeking rate. They use it as their – that's their
operating account. And so, we believe that we will continue to see some decline in the NIB. Again, conservatively,
put $4 billion out of that, we think there's probably a chance that there'll be – it will all come out at NIB but we
thought that was the best thing to do from a guidance standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's very helpful. Thank you. And then separately, I wanted follow up on your comments around the NIM
protection that you put in place. How would you respond to the view that the downside protection that banks are
putting on in this environment doesn't make a lot of sense because of the negative carry associated with it, since
the forward curve, discounts everything that we see in the current environment, you're effectively just investing at
whatever the yield curve is – wherever yield curve is at the moment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, the most important thing to remember is our hedging strategy is not meant to generate increases in NII. It is
a risk reduction measure. It's a hedge. Is to protect us in low rates. When you have a deposit franchise like we do
that has lower cost than our peers and that's the way it's been historically, as rates come down, we don't have a
mechanism to protect our net interest margin because we can't lower deposit cost much – as low as our peers
can. Therefore, we have to do it synthetically. And that's what the hedge program does.
And we set these up generally forward starting, so we don't have negative carry until they start or the risk of
negative carry until they start. And frankly, if we do at that time, that means rates are higher and the rest of our
book is earning that much more and we're okay with that. What it means is, yes, it costs us a little bit in NII but we
have leading margin, so we're okay. And you can't think of it as a trade as some people talk about it as being a
trade, that's not what it is. It's a hedge to protect us in low rate.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Question on loan growth. I'm just curious how much competitive retrenchment you're seeing from
the banks you compete with most often and how offensive are you willing to get for credits that look really
attractive [indiscernible] (00:53:30)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, I would say, first of all, plenty of competition out there. And we don't – while there are certain segments,
particularly real estate, where there are some competitors who are not as active today for a variety of reasons, in
general, the market is very competitive, whether it be large banks, regional banks, smaller banks that we compete
with. And so, we've got to be actively calling on our customers and our prospects and being very diligent in our
activities, making sure that we're in the market in front of customer. When we're doing that, we get opportunities.
With respect to how aggressive we want to be, we don't change our approach to how we think about credit risk
management, how we think about pricing and structure. We want to win because we have expertise, because we
provide really good ideas and solutions to customers. And we think that that resonates and as a result has helped
us continue to build on growth in our portfolios.

to build a balance sheet and income statement, and importantly, a culture of risk management that will allow us to
