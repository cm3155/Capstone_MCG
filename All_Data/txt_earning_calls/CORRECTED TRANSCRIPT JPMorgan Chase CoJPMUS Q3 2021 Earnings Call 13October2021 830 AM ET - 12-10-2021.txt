MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings
Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the
presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and
CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum.
Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the
disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $11.7 billion, EPS of $3.74 on revenue
of $30.4 billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 22%. These results include a $2.1 billion net
credit reserve release which I'll cover in more detail shortly as well as an income tax benefit of $566 million.
Adjusting for these items, we delivered an 18% ROTCE this quarter.
Touching on a few highlights. It was another strong quarter for Investment Banking including an all-time record for
M&A. And while loan growth remains muted, we see a number of indicators to suggest it has stabilized and may
be poised to begin more robust growth across the company and particularly in Card. And consistent with last
quarter, credit continues to be quite healthy, in fact, net charge-offs are the lowest we've experienced in recent
history.
On page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $30.4 billion, was up $500 million or 2% year-on-year. Net
interest income was up 1% with balance sheet growth and higher rates primarily offset by mix and lower CIB
markets' NII. And NIR was up 3% driven by solid fee generation across Investment Banking and AWM largely
offset by net securities losses in Corporate versus gains in the prior year and lower revenue in Home Lending.
Expenses of $17.1 billion were up 1% year-on-year on continued investments and higher volume and revenue-
related expenses predominantly offset by lower legal expense and the absence of an impairment in the prior year.
And credit costs were a net benefit of $1.5 billion driven by the reserve release but it's also worth noting that net
charge-offs of just over $500 million were approximately half of last year's third quarter number.
Let's go to reserves on the next page. We released $2.1 billion this quarter driven by less severe downside
scenarios as the macro environment continues to normalize. Reserves stand at $20.5 billion which still accounts
for elevated uncertainties surrounding COVID and the current labor market dynamics including the expiration of
expanded unemployment benefits. Now moving to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter
with a CET1 ratio of 12.9% down modestly primarily on higher RWA. The firm distributed $8 billion of capital to
shareholders this quarter including $5 billion of net repurchases and the common dividend was increased to $1
per share.
With that, let's move on to our businesses starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 5. CCB
reported net income of $4.3 billion including reserve releases of $950 million on revenue of $12.5 billion down 3%
year-on-year. Deposits were up 3% quarter-on-quarter indicating some deceleration as excess deposits are
stabilizing. Notably contributing to this growth, we ranked number one in retail deposit share based on the FDIC
data and we're the only large bank to show meaningful share growth, up 70 basis points year-on-year.

Similarly, client investment assets were up 29% year-on-year and while market performance was a driver, retail
flows in both advisor and digital channels were strong. Touching on spend, combined credit and debit spend was
up 24% versus the third quarter of 2019 and in line with last quarter. Within that data, travel and entertainment
spend was up 8% versus 3Q 2019 and very closely tracked the patterns of the Delta variant within the quarter,
softening in August and early September and reaccelerating in recent weeks.
Card outstandings were up 1% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter, benefiting from higher new account
originations. And while the payment rate is still very elevated, it's come down from the highs and revolving
balances have stabilized, and when we look inside our data, we see evidence of excess deposits starting to
normalize and segments of the population that traditionally revolve. So as a result, we're optimistic about the
growth prospects of revolving Card balances.
Moving to Home Lending, average loans were down 6% year-on-year, but up 2% quarter-on-quarter with portfolio
additions now outpacing prepayments. It was another strong quarter for originations totaling nearly $42 billion, up
43% year-on-year, reflecting record purchase volume and share gains in the refi market. And in Auto, we had
$11.5 billion of originations second only to last quarter's record. So overall, loans ex-PPP were up 3% quarter-on-
quarter on the growth in Card and Home Lending I just mentioned.
Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 5% year-on-year driven by investments in the business including marketing. And
more generally, we continue to see that the acceleration in digital adoption during the pandemic has persisted
with active mobile users up 10% year-on-year to almost 45 million. So with that, looking forward, we are
encouraged by our household growth and balance sheet trends. However, we expect it to take some time for
revolving credit card balances to return to pre-pandemic levels given the amount of liquidity in the system. In the
meantime, credit losses and delinquencies remain extraordinarily low. In Card, on a year-to-date basis versus
2019, low charge-offs more than offset lower NII.
Next, the Corporate & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $5.6 billion on revenue of $12.4
billion. Investment Banking revenue of $3 billion was up 45% versus the prior year and down 12% sequentially. IB
fees were up 52% year-on-year driven by strong performance in Advisory and Equity Underwriting and we
maintained our number one rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 9.4%.
And Advisory was an all-time record quarter benefiting from the surge in M&A activity and we almost tripled fees
year-on-year in a market that doubled. Debt Underwriting fees were up 3% driven by an active leverage loan
market primarily linked to acquisition financing. And in Equity Underwriting, fees were up 41% primarily driven by
our strong performance in IPOs. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the overall pipeline is healthy and the M&A
market is expected to remain active. And if so, IB fees should be up year-on-year but down sequentially.
Moving to markets, total revenue was $6.3 billion, down 5% compared to a record third quarter last year. Notably,
we were up 24% from 2019 driven by the continued strong performance in equities and spread products. Fixed
income was down 20% year-on-year due to ongoing normalization across products particularly in commodities as
well as an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in our derivatives portfolio.
Equities was up 30%, a record third quarter, with strength across regions and reflecting higher balances in prime,
strong client activity in cash, as well as ongoing momentum in derivatives. In terms of outlook, keep in mind that it
will be a difficult compare against a record fourth quarter of last year, but the current environment continues to
challenge our ability to forecast revenues. Wholesale Payments revenue of $1.6 billion was up 22% or up 10%
excluding gains on strategic equity investments, and the year-on-year growth was driven by higher deposits and

fees, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 9%,
primarily driven by growth in fees on higher market levels.
Expenses of $5.9 billion were flat year-on-year as higher structural and volume and revenue-related expense as
well as investments were offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $638 million, driven
by the reserve release I mentioned upfront.
Moving to Commercial Banking on page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.4 billion. Revenue of
$2.5 billion was up 10% year-on-year on higher Investment Banking and Wholesale Payments revenue. Record
gross Investment Banking revenue of $1.3 billion was up 60%, primarily driven by increased large deal activity
with continued strength in M&A and acquisition-related financing across both corporate client and middle market
banking. Expenses of $1 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly due to investments and higher volume
and revenue-related expenses.
Deposits were up 4% sequentially, mainly driven by higher operating balances. And loans were down 1% quarter-
on-quarter. C&I loans were down 3% but up 1%, excluding PPP, driven by higher originations. And it's also worth
noting that consistent with last quarter, we are seeing a slight uptick in utilization rates in middle market. And
those among larger corporates seem to have stabilized, albeit at historically low levels. CRE loans were flat with
modestly higher originations in commercial term lending, offset by net payoff activity in real estate banking.
Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $363 million, driven by reserve releases, with net charge-offs of 6 basis
points.
And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of
$1.2 billion with pre-tax margin of 37%. Record revenue of $4.3 billion was up 21% year-on-year as higher
management fees and growth in deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit margin compression.
Expenses of $2.8 billion were up 13% year-on-year, largely driven by higher performance-related compensation
as well as distribution fees. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $33 billion continued to be positive across all
channels, asset classes and regions with notable strength in equities and fixed income. AUM of $3 trillion and
overall assets of $4.1 trillion, up 17% and 22% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by higher market levels
and strong net inflows. And finally, loans were up 3% quarter-on-quarter with continued strength in custom
lending, securities-based lending and mortgages, while deposits were up 5% sequentially.
Turning to Corporate on page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $817 million, including $383 million of the $566
million tax benefit that I mentioned upfront. Revenue was a loss of $1.3 billion, down $957 million year-on-year.
NII was a loss of $1.1 billion, down $372 million primarily on limited deployment opportunities as deposit growth
continued. And we realized $256 million of net investment securities losses in the quarter compared to $466
million of net gains last year. Expenses of $160 million were down $559 million year-on-year primarily driven by
the absence of an impairment on a legacy investment in the prior year.
On the next page, let's discuss the outlook. Our full year outlook for 2021 remains largely in line with our previous
guidance. We still expect NII to be approximately $52.5 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $71
billion. But as you'll see on the page, we've lowered our outlook for the Card net charge-off rate to around 2% as
delinquencies remain very low. So to wrap up, we're pleased with this quarter's performance as we approach
what we hope is the tail end of the pandemic. The strengths of the company both in terms of our diversified
business model as well as our fortress balance sheet, talent, and culture have enabled us to perform well through
this difficult period while continuing to serve our clients, customers and communities.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
As we look ahead and the environment normalizes, new challenges will undoubtedly arise, but we feel confident
with the position of the company and the strategy going forward.
With that, operator, please open the line to Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: And our first question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. John, please
proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning, Jeremy. Wanted to ask about the net interest income guidance for the year, it seems to imply a
nice step up in NII for the fourth quarter to roughly $13.5 billion. Was wondering what do you expect to be the
drivers of that sequential step up and would you see the fourth quarter NII as a good starting point for us to think
about our 2022 NII forecast?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. John, good question and good calc there. It's true. That is quite a bit of sequential growth. If you do the
math, it suggests about $350 million. And in reality, if you think about what we've been saying about the outlook
for increased revolve and deployment and so on, the increase is non-intuitively high and so, just to explain, within
that there are a couple factors.
So one, there's actually a meaningful amount of markets NII growth between the third and the fourth quarter
which in general we sort of encourage you to ignore and there's also some sequential increase in NII from PPP
forgiveness contributing to the fourth quarter number. So if you strip those two out, you still see a little bit of
modest growth which is a little bit more consistent I think with the overall story that we've been telling which is that
the real acceleration in NII especially from higher Card revolve is a 2022 item.
In that context, then, if you take that sort of lower number and think about annualizing that, I think it's fair to
assume that that would be a sort of lower end estimate for the 2022 number in light of what we believe will
happen in terms of especially Card revolve. But obviously we'll give you a little bit more color about 2022 on next
quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And as a follow up, your cash balances continue to grow and you've been conservative on liquidity
deployment. Could you update us on your thinking around liquidity deployment, pacing that, and what factors
you're balancing?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
Yeah, totally. So at the highest level I would say that nothing has really changed meaning we're still all else equal
happy to be patient. We still believe in a robust global recovery. We still are a little bit concerned about inflation I
think relative to the consensus and all of that contributes to a willingness to be relatively patient about
deployment. But it's also fair to say that relative to last quarter, rates are obviously higher. We start to see central
banks around the world normalizing their policy stance a little bit. So the market implied rates are coming a little
bit more in line with our view and given that, it wouldn't be surprising if we saw some more opportunities for front-
end deployment cash and cash-like activity as well as possibly some duration management.

James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Research Partners
Hey. Good morning. Just first on loan growth, as you noted, Auto has been strong, Card's starting to show signs
of life. But it looks like outside of acquisition finance, C&I still seems a little weak, and we've got ongoing supply
chain issues. So as we think about the big picture, how are you seeing, I guess, loan demand trends playing out
and what are you expecting as the next 12 months progresses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. So let's go through loan growth because obviously that's one of the areas that everyone's interested in. So
if we start with Card, which is obviously the one that's going to matter the most in terms of NII impact, as you said,
we see some signs of life, and we believe that recovery is strongly underway, and it seems hopefully like delta is
really fading. So that's going to help. If you just look forward just to the holiday season, we would expect to see
normal seasonality and normal growth there.
And the question really for Card, as we've talked about a lot, is whether that growth in spend and in Card
outstandings translates into revolve. But as I noted in the prepared remarks, when we look inside the data and we
look at the customers who have both deposit accounts with us and our Card customers and we look at those who
would typically be the ones that are most inclined to revolve, we actually do see slightly faster spend down of the
excess deposit balances there. So that makes us relatively optimistic about both the potential for Card
outstandings to grow with higher spend but also for increased revolve and lower pay rates as we go into next
year. It's going to take time obviously but that is the core view.
In Home Lending, broadly, we expect that this quarter's trend with portfolio additions outpacing prepayments to
continue. And then in C&I which you mentioned, just a reminder, right, that as you go to the higher end of the
spectrum in terms of the size of the C&I customers, we're eager to lend to them as a key part of the franchise, but
from a financial performance perspective that's more of an outcome rather than a goal. But we do, as I noted
upfront, see a little bit of an uptick in utilization rates amongst smaller corporates. So that's kind of consistent with
the theme that we've been seeing which is that the smaller you are and the less likely you are to have had – to
7


JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
have benefited from the wide-open capital markets the more likely you are to be borrowing. We do hear a lot
about supply chain issues from that customer segment. So it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out.
And then in CRE, we see quite a robust origination pipeline as we've sort of fully removed any pandemic-related
credit pullbacks, and we're leaning into that. And we do expect to see a little bit of net loan growth going forward.
And then finally, I would note that we do see some loan growth in markets, actually, and we generally discourage
you from focusing too much on NII and loan growth within markets. But it is an indicator that there are some
opportunities there that we're taking advantage of in the usual kind of nimble way that you would expect us to do
in markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Research Partners
Okay. That's all very helpful. And maybe just a follow up on the expense side, you and your peers have all seen
higher expenses this year, higher capital markets and incentive expense and increased investment spend. But as
we think about going into next year of capital markets activity normalizes as many expect, can we start to see
expense growth slow? Or are there other considerations to think about, whether it's investment spend or inflation
pressures that we should think about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. So it's a little bit of an all-of-the-above story, I would say. So first of all, we're still in the middle of budgeting,
and it's sort of a little early to be giving you 2022 expense guidance. We'll do more of that next quarter. But
realistically, expenses are going to be up next year.
Now, to your point about capital markets-related expenses, it's obviously true that we pay for performance and in
light of the very strong performance over the last couple years in both banking and markets, we have seen
increased compensation expense on the way up. And therefore, as a function of the amount of normalization that
you see in 2022, you're going to see that come down in line, all else equal.
Obviously, I would point out that I think that the amount of growth in that number that we've seen through the
pandemic is less than a lot of people would have expected, actually. And therefore, on the way back down, you
would also potentially expect less participation, not to mention just the timing dynamics associated with the
treatment of stock-based compensation vesting. So all of that aside, at the same time, we are still investing. We
still see significant opportunities. We still see marketing opportunities in Card. And, yeah, labor inflation is a
question. You saw us raise wages in parts of the US at the entry level that just came into effect this September.
And as we look out, we see a lot of churn, and as Jamie was saying, it's good stuff. It's normal, it's
understandable in this environment, but labor inflation is definitely a watch item for us.
So when you put all that stuff together, as I say, we'll update you more next quarter, but that's sort of how we see
the expense outlook for next year.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. There were a couple events during the quarter that I wanted to ask about, and specifically, how has the tech
strategy evolved. One, you made the announcement that you're changing the retail bank core system entirely to
the public cloud, and that's a big change. And Jamie, I would love to hear your comments on that. And then,
second, your expansion in the UK with digital banking, what metrics are you shooting for?
And third, your recent FinTech acquisitions, to what degree – are there synergies among the acquisitions in
addition to JPMorgan? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Okay, Mike. Hang on. I'm writing down your questions because I don't want to lose track. Okay, so let's start with
the cloud first. So yeah, you will have seen some press coverage around our partnership with Thought Machine.
At a high level, there's actually nothing new here. We've actually been committed to the cloud for a long time, and
by the way, when I say cloud, I think we're talking about both private and public cloud. Our core strategy involves
really leaning into both and being very nimble across both, and I think that's very important for us as a regulated
institution from a resiliency perspective.
But the reasons for – and that's all part of our overall tech modernization roadmap and a lot of the investments
that we're doing that you've heard all the leadership of the company talk about.
When it comes to Thought Machine in the Consumer space, there are five main reasons why we did that, and it's
all the normal reasons why you do cloud stuff and you do tech modernization. We want to be able to innovate
quickly and bring products to consumers faster. We want to be able to run multiple products on the same
platform. As I mentioned, resiliency is critical. Increasingly, we want to be able to run the bank much more in real-
time rather than based on batch processes. And obviously, APIs are central to the entire strategy in this
environment.
So that's what I would say about that. Now...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Thought Machine is basically the core general ledger. It's not all the other stuff around Consumer. And when you
do these conversions different than conversions of the past, you can do them – you can schedule pieces do part
at a time, not all at once like a big bang which we used to have to do when we did big mergers and stuff like that.
So I just put it at lower risk for the company. But the core strategy hasn't changed at all.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. Okay. And then, Mike, international consumer and acquisitions I think you asked about. So in terms of
international consumer, you will have seen that we launched – it's obviously early days to give meaningful
updates on that, but you will have noted actually that we've just rebranded Nutmeg as a JPMorgan company just
a couple days ago, so all of that's proceeding at pace and it seems to be pretty well received. I think the offering is
seen as differentiated and innovative. So we'll have more to say about that over time.
Generally...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Can I just – again [ph] just to add to that, (00:26:34) this is a 10-year game plan. This is not that we're going to
worry that much about metrics in the next month or two. And this is a long-term work to try to get this thing right
because if we're ever going to be retail overseas it's going to be digital, and so we're going to be very patient. And
at one point, Mike, we will report some metrics here so you can see them, but they're not going to be material to
the firm's numbers for years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. It's going to take time, for sure. So, but just more generally in terms of the acquisition strategy, we've talked
about this a little bit before. We're not claiming that we have some overarching top-down acquisition strategy. I
think broadly we're just doing things that make sense. But there are some themes that you can detect around bolt-
on and adding capabilities.
Just for the sake of argument, if you start with AWM, you see a pretty consistent theme in there of ESG-related
capability additions. You've mentioned already international expansion and the potential for growth, and it will be a
long game, as Jamie says. And then, yeah, there's definitely a FinTech narrative a little bit in terms of some of the
stuff that we've done in the CIB. And then within Consumer, most recently, the collection of things that we've
done, I think, is unified by the theme of providing more integrated and holistic experiences to our customers.
We've always been really proud of the value proposition that we offer, especially in the Card product, but we think
we can take it up even another notch with some of the stuff that we're doing around lounges and cxLoyalty and
stuff like that. So I think I touched on everything there, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
You certainly did. And just a follow up. I mean we see the results, the marginal efficiency in the businesses where
you're growing has improved, and we just don't have the why. So how much of that is tech-driven versus other
reasons? I mean I guess you have metrics internally that we just don't have. But your marginal efficiency is what?
Or your unit costs are going down. Or any additional color as to the why the marginal efficiency is improving?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. So, I mean, I think reasonable people can differ on how you talk about this stuff, especially in terms of what
parts of the expense base you see as a little bit more fixed versus a little bit more floating. I would have said that
in reality, marginal expense increases as a function of most types of marginal revenue are actually lower than a
lot of people think. So the sort of operating leverage that you see, especially in the type of environment that we've
10

had with really big increases in revenue in the capital markets areas and the NIR side, is actually relatively
consistent with what I would have expected. But a little bit to your point, Mike, what is also true is that we're a big
organization. There's a scale play here. We have a big fixed cost base. And a lot of the modernization agenda is
about making sure that that doesn't creep and that it's as expensive as possible so that it can be as nimble as
possible and that marginal efficiency over time is as good as possible. But that's a long play there.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
All right. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Let me just add, Mike, one of the things you think about, one is people worried about the forecast for next year
and stuff like that. We're playing the game for 10 years here. So we're going – and we're not going to disclose
certain things like margin by product or stuff like that because it's competitive information. But the long game, we
are competing with some very large talented global players. We're not even in banking today. And we are going to
compete in that. So even some of these acquisitions are more around that than around just what I consider
traditional banking.
And so and in my whole life, just so you know, we've been modernizing technology. Every year, of every month,
of every quarter that's like a permanent state of affairs. Obviously, now it's to the cloud and stuff like that. Those
things are critical to do to be competitive going forward. That was true, by the way, 20 years ago.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask if you can expand a little bit more upon Card fees and Card revenue rate.
We all certainly expected the marketing expenses to kind of go up inside that line. And just wondering if you can
help us understand how much of that was captured in the third quarter and just what your general outlook is for
the fee line and the underlying overall revenue rate. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. Thanks, Ken. So you're right. Part of the drop in the revenue rate this quarter is a function of higher Card
marketing spend, which you would have expected as a result of what we said last quarter in terms of the
importance of getting our fair share of the growth in spending as we emerged from the pandemic and the fact that
we're out in the market with a lot of offers that are seeing good uptake and we're seeing nice growth there. So
that's expected. And I think that Card marketing number will actually remain elevated, and if anything tick up a
little bit sequentially just based on how the amortization there works. So you should expect to see that continue.

But, in addition, this quarter we have just an adjustment to the rewards liability, which is contributing to the drop
this quarter as well. So that is not something that we see continuing. So that should come out of the run rate as
we look forward.

going forward?

Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. I mean, as you know, we don't really manage the Card revenue rate. So it's not a number that I'm eager to
guide to. But I think if I remember correctly, I think the rewards liability adjustment this quarter was of the order of
something like $180 million. So we'll confirm that. But I think that's right.

Okay. Thanks. If I might just ask Jamie. You made a comment yesterday about the supply chain hopefully easing
by next year around this time. What are you just hearing from your partners around the world in terms of the log
jams and the potential for that to open up from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah, I'm not hearing much different than you're hearing. I'm just – I know that the over focus over time is so
extraordinary sometimes in the press that people forget the big picture. The economy is growing 4% or 5%, what
people are buying has changed, which has also hurt supply chains a little bit. There's not one company I know
that is not working aggressively to fix their supply chain issues. Sales are still up. Credit card, debit card spends
still up. Consumer's in great shape and capitalism works. I doubt we'll be talking about supply chain stuff in a
year. I just think we're focusing on it too much and it's simply dampening a fairly good economy. It's not reversing
a fairly good economy.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Yeah, two questions. One just following up on the Card discussion that we just had regarding the fees and the
$180 million on the – roughly $180 million on the rewards adjustment. I mean it still leaves us with a pretty big
decline Q-on-Q. And I'm just trying to think through that a little bit because I know marketing rewards, et cetera, is
up. But was there anything in particular that would have driven a one-timer that is unlikely to persist or not? I
realize that cash back is a little more expensive, so maybe that's a piece of it and it's a one-time move. Or is it
more a function of, hey, we're going to be ramping our offerings here, and so you should expect that the forward
look is a step-down from what you had been seeing in 2Q?

Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. So, Betsy, in short, it's really the latter. So the only thing that is one-time-ish in nature, for lack of a better
term, is the rewards liability adjustment. And the rest of it really is marketing spend. And we see that as a critical
investment in this moment. It's a moment of high engagement with the product and we're very committed to
making those investments. And so that is going to remain elevated and, if anything, tick up a little bit as we look
forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then separately, I think today is the last day of the Vice Chair of Supervision, Randy Quarles
term as Vice Chair of Sup and Reg. And so the question is, how should we be thinking about how you are
positioning for an environment where maybe these rules don't change, right, like the LCR, the SLR, other things
that we have been hoping might have some changes in them? Should we be anticipating that in order to help
deliver the growth that you're looking for that we should anticipate more pref issuance going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. So I think – obviously, we're a little disappointed that we haven't seen some of the changes on the non risk-
sensitive size base constraints that we'd expected. But we're still hopeful that that will come soon. We know the
staff is hard at work on the Basel III end game, and that's complicated stuff and it may be the case that some of
those things are connected. And our strategy on pref issuance has been to try to balance, giving ourselves the
capacity that we want to deal with the SLR constraint without over-issuing, and therefore, being stuck with high
cost prefs that aren't callable for five years. So that's part of the reason why we're operating a little bit above our
CET1 target right now, and we're just going to continue to be nimble in that respect.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. So in the spirit of your thought on not overly focusing on the near term, I heard your
comments on payment rates in Card, 4Q seasonality, optimism about revolving card balances. So is there an
implicit comment within there about buy now, pay later and the impact it may or may not have? I'd love to get your
perspective on [ph] kind of (00:37:15) this old, but I guess new payment option, might have on the card industry
overall. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So BNPL, everyone's talking about it. It is funny how layaway's back in the e-commerce
checkout lane. And obviously, we're looking at it. Everyone's talking about it. And it's a moment for us as a
company where even though for any given thing that's emerging, you can easily convince yourself that it's kind of
not a threat. We're in a moment of taking all types of potential disruptions, especially FinTechy-type disruptions,
13


JPMorgan Chase & Co.
(JPM) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
quite seriously. And in the case of BNPL, it's obviously particularly high profile because of the growth that we've
seen, although it's a relatively small portion of the overall market.
I'll remind you that we have our own very compelling offerings that speak directly to the installment payment
experience in the form of My Chase Loan and My Chase Plan, which we get really good feedback on the
customer experience there in terms of kind of post-purchase experience. You can select eligible purchases on the
app and then move that to installment plan if you want. But, yeah, we acknowledge that it is downstream of the
point of sale, which potentially raises some questions about whether we should be looking at moving a little bit
more upstream there.
But even more generally when you take a step back, what we're really trying to do in the Consumer business here
is think about what is the actual customer need that is driving the growth in BNPL and how can we respond to it in
a strategic holistic way across all of our customers and not sort of too narrowly and too reactively just respond to
BNPL. But it's obviously a thing that we're looking at and it's quite interesting.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
...you saw a firm come out and it's no longer just about BNPL, they're going to have a debit card and a cash
banking account. So these are all different forms of competition which we have to respond to. And so that's why
when we talk about like expenses, we will spend whatever we have to spend to compete with all these folks in our
space.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I appreciate all that. Maybe one other comment – or to get your thought on the right perspective to think about
China and Evergrande and what people care about most is, is there an expansion across border? Meaning, is this
contained within their market? Is the funders – that will have some marks within their market or do you see any
domino effect in crossing borders? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. So, look, obviously everyone is looking at Evergrande. Let me just start by saying that for us in terms of
direct Evergrande exposure is absolutely de minimis. So that's one piece. As you would expect, we've also looked
at sort of more indirect exposures in terms of the broad general properties sector as well as exposures of financial
institutions that we deal with to the China property sector. And in general, those exposures were all very modest.
So we're obviously watching it closely and continuing to look for read across and do what you would expect us to
do. But we're not terribly concerned right now about the impact on us.

I think in terms of cross-border contagion, I don't hold my own opinion on this in particularly high regard, but it
does seem like this was pretty well telegraphed by the Chinese authorities when they talked about their three red
lines. So it's a process that's being managed. And I would say that the better view right now is that it will be
contained. But of course, it's the market, so we'll see what happens.

proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow up on two themes that were discussed, one around FinTechs and the
regulatory changes, a lot of focus on the change in leadership at the regulatory agencies. Jamie, you've talked
about in the past in terms of the regulatory arbitrage when you look at big tech nonbank players. I think BNPL is a
good example of that. Do you think as we have new leadership at the regulatory agencies, they are alert to this
arbitrage and do you think we see a clamp down or is it too late for really them to create a framework that would
level the playing field?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
I don't expect that there will be beneficial changes that help banks. But I think that we just have to compete with
the hand we're dealt and not expect anything like that. And I think that you're going to have some people clamp
down more on banks and maybe some people regulate FinTech based on products or service, something like
that, but I'm not expecting any relief.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. Yeah. And I was just wondering if there'll be increased scrutiny of the nonbank players relative to the banks
but point noted. And I guess just on a separate question, Jeremy, we didn't see any build in the CET1 when I look
at the numerator. Anything going on there this quarter that impacted it and with the stock rate is at 2.4 times
tangible book, just remind us how important are buybacks here as opposed to just keeping some dry powder as
the economy gets better?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. So I mean the answer to how important buybacks are is that they're at the end of our capital hierarchy as
we often say, right? So organic growth, including acquisitions, sustainable dividend, and only then do we look at
buybacks. And in light of the SCB environment that we're in where we don't have a Fed-approved buyback plan
anymore and if we just simply have to comply with the minimums in BAU that gives us quite a bit of nimbleness
which is an important thing to preserve in light of a world where we do hope for loan growth next year and where
acquisitions are still potentially on the horizon. So nothing really going on this quarter other than the little bit of
RWA growth in the denominator, and we're just really going to stay nimble there.

But is there a case to be made, Jeremy, in terms of just holding some dry powder in excess capital given your
macro outlook as opposed to buying back stock at current valuations?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. I think the valuations, as the stock goes up, you should expect us maybe one day buy less. And we don't
need dry powder. We have an extraordinary amount of capital liquidity, I mean extraordinary. And we earned $40
billion pre-tax a year. I mean how much dry powder do you need? We have $1.6 trillion of cash and marketable
securities. We have well over $200 billion of equity. We can issue preferreds. We can issue debt. We can issue
stock, if we had to something. So I don't think we need dry powder. I think our capital cup runneth over where it is.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Good morning. So, Jeremy, you provided some helpful detail on the drivers of loan growth by category. Just
looking ahead, is your expectation that loan growth begins to keep pace with GDP or economic growth? Or is
there anything that would actually justify more meaningful acceleration in lending activity, whether it's just greater
pent-up loan demand, normalization of the Card payment rates, or something else?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Good question, Steve. But I think you're sort of potentially leading me into giving fairly detailed loan growth
guidance for 2022, which I am not really in a position to do. But let me see if I can answer this at a high level. I
mean, we've talked a lot about spend, which we believe in, driving Card loans higher. So that's one piece. And the
revolve story within that as a function of the spend down in cash buffers, especially in our revolver – the revolving
segment of our customers. And obviously, as you know well, if you kind of think about our NII as the sum product
of the NIM and the outstandings and the various loan categories, it is really disproportionately Card that drives
things.
In the meantime, if you move a little bit away from Consumer to the larger wholesale system, in a world where,
even if tapering starts relatively soon, if that plays out over roughly eight months at $15 billion of decrease a
month, you still, if you do the math, wind up with another $0.5 trillion of QE. So we are dealing with a system that
has a lot of surplus liquidity. And so in that context, realistically, it's hard to imagine seeing a lot of wholesale loan
growth, at a minimum, but frankly that's not really a big driver of performance for us. So I don't know if that helps,
but it's a good question.

Thanks, Jeremy. It absolutely helps. And just one clarifying question on the FICC commentary. You noted this
quarter's result included an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in the derivatives portfolio. I was hoping you could
help unpack what that adjustment actually entails, what prompted it? And could you help size the impact in the
quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
I could help unpack it, but it would take another 20 minutes which we don't really have. It's just bog-standard
liquidity valuation type stuff in the derivatives book in terms of as we revise our assumptions about what the
potential transaction cost would be associated with transferring certain types of positions. It's normal course stuff
that just happened to be a little bit bigger. I think fixed income was down 20%, and I think without that it would
have been down 15%. So if that helps.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, guys. Was hoping to follow up on the capacity to deploy liquidity. And I guess just to kind of lean in a little bit,
if we look at the growth in deposits, I know some of them are kind of considered noncore, but take out the loan
growth and the growth in securities book since COVID, you've got about an extra $500 billion of deposits. And
how much of that do you think can be deployed into securities, and understanding that you expect loan growth to
pick up so that will go to some, but is there a way to size that $500 billion capacity in terms of buying securities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah, so I think there's a lot of factors that play into what the deployment decision is in any given moment.
Obviously, as you said, loan growth, but also, we always make these decisions on the long-term economic basis,
not for the purpose of generating short-term NII. And so when you do that, you have to think about capital
volatility, drawdowns, and frankly, whether or not you see value. And that, if anything, is probably the biggest
single factor right now.
As I talked about earlier, it is true that the market has come a little bit more in line with our views, at least from a
rate perspective, and that may lead to a little bit more deployment, all else equal right now. But when you start
talking about spread product, for example, in light of the liquidity environment that we're in the QE numbers that I
mentioned a second ago, that remains very, very compressed and there's just not a lot of value there.
So we're always – we always try to be long-term economically motivated there considering all the scenarios,
considering risk management, considering the convexity of the balance sheet, and looking at value and being
tactical there. So that's really how I would think about that.

Yeah, I mean, understood on a near-term basis, but I think a lot of investors are sitting here saying if the 10-year
or really any part of the curve hits that magic point for you, what is just the capacity? So, for example, if the 10-
year gets to say 3% and you're confident it's not going to go to 5%, do you have $100 billion of capacity? Is it
$300 billion? Just any way to frame it longer term, appreciating that it's not what you're looking to do at this

Jeremy Barnum A

Yeah, I mean, I got the question. I got why you want to know. I guess I just feel – think like for a company of our
sophistication and given how carefully we think about this stuff, the idea of a particular target at which we would
deploy a particular amount, of course, Jamie is right, but it's always going to be situational. It's always going to be
a function of why the rate is where it is. I mean, in your question you alluded to, it's like if the 10-year note is at 3%
and we're sure it's not going to 5%, but then where's the rest of the yield curve? What are the other options?
What's going on in that moment? So it's – there's – we're always going to be situational and tactical about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And then can I just squeeze in, you've announced a bunch of kind of what most of us would
characterize as relatively small acquisitions, some this quarter and obviously looking back for the full year. Is
there something – is there a way you can kind of size the capital impact of that? I know most of the terms weren't
disclosed individually, but any way to frame kind of the capital and financial impact?
And then just lastly, remind us like what is the driving force when you look for a deal? Because some of the deals,
you kind of look at, and you're like, how does that fit into broader JPMorgan Chase? Thank you.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning. Jeremy, you were saying that when we were talking earlier about the potential SLR
changes and such, and we haven't seen anything and Quarles is leaving today, but you mentioned about maybe
the Fed is focused on the Basel III end game that's coming very soon here. Can you share with us from your
guys' perspective, what are you focusing in on with the Basel III final rules and regulations that could affect your
growth going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. So I think – I mean the thing about the Basel III end game is that you need to essentially deal
simultaneously with the Basel floors, the Basel standardized floors, and the Collins floor. So you need to
simultaneously – so from the perspective of the staff that's working on this stuff, they have a tough challenge to
simultaneously put in place a US rule which is Basel-compliant while also complying with the Collins floor,
standardized RWA minimum. So that's complicated and it's hard. And it's quite technical. And it sort of explains
why it's taking a little bit longer than we might have otherwise thought.
In terms of the impact of that on our long-term growth, I mean, at a high level it's unlikely to be significant. I think
that the related point is whether or not there are some changes as part of that or contemporaneously with that to
these sort of non-risk sensitive, size-based constraints like G-SIB and SLR where, obviously, most prominently in
the case of G-SIB, it's really getting pretty extreme in terms of the growth in the score for reasons that really have
nothing to do with what the original design of the metric was, and to a very significant degree, are driven by the
expansion of the system that we've seen in the last 18 months. So that's why we believe that that should be
addressed, as was contemplated in the original rule.
And so across all of those potential changes you could see us doing a little bit of optimization in response to
those. You can imagine that Basel III end game in terms of standardized and advanced and the impact on
different products might make some things a little bit more capital efficient and others a little bit less capital
efficient at the margin. But we're a big diversified company and we're pretty good at navigating this stuff. So when
we have clarity, we'll make the necessary tweaks.

Very good. Thank you. And then, obviously, you and the industry have seen really good deposit growth on a year-
over-year basis. I think your deposits were up 20% all-in. You talked specifically about retail being the number
one market share in retail deposits. When the Fed ends QE, assuming it does sometime by the middle of next
year, and I'm not asking you guys to forecast what your deposits are going to be. But just higher level, should we
anticipate that deposits could actually decline or no that they are going to be so sticky even with the liquidity that
19

everybody carries that we shouldn't really see a decline in deposits after QE ends let's call it second half of next
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. So I think there's a couple of factors in here. So let's, for the sake of argument, set RRP aside for a second
and hold that constant. If you just look at the impact of QE on system-wide deposits, we talk about tapering, but
as I said earlier, tapering still involves another $0.5 trillion of system expansion between now and the end of
tapering – or rather between the start of tapering and the end of tapering.
If the Fed follows the same type of trajectory that it followed last time, there would be an extended pause between
the end of QE and the beginning of QT. And again, setting RRP aside for a second, it would only really be with
the beginning of QT that you would expect the size of the system deposit base to start shrinking. And I think the
timing last time, if I remember correctly, was something like 22 months between the end of QE and the beginning
of QT. Now, of course, RRP could bounce around and there could be other factors but, at a high level, that's how
we're thinking about it.

I would just add my two cents. I think they'll have to go quicker than that and they'll have to reverse some of it. So
you're talking about we've still got to increase deposits for a year and then there would be a fairly large reduction
over a two or three-year period which we should be prepared for.

So the plan is on schedule. Move-in date, I think, 2025. There are no material expense – of course, there's
duplicate expenses and we have to sell the building and stuff like that, but there's nothing material to our
shareholders that we need to disclose. Operator, any other questions?

Operator: Our next question – yes, sir. That is coming from Andrew Lim from Société Générale. Please
proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Lim Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So you talked, Jamie, about how you're focusing on inflation.
Just wondering if you could outline what you're looking at exactly, metric-wise, across your businesses to signal to
you that inflation is actually materializing as a concern and how would that pan out versus your expectations. And
in terms of [ph] like (00:59:16) how we deal with this, if it does materialize as a concern, is there anything that you
can do to try and protect the bank against inflationary forces there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. Well, I mean, I think we should look at the big picture here, which I think is always important. I mean two
years ago, we were facing COVID, virtually a Great Depression global pandemic, and that's all in the back mirror,
which is good. So by hopefully a year from now, be no supply chain problem. The pandemic will become
endemic. And I think it's very good to have good healthy growth, which we have.
And I think it would be good to have unemployment at 4%. It's good that there are jobs that are open. I think it's
good that wage is going up along. And I think there's too much focus on – and none of this changes how we run
the business, which is we add clients all the time, consumer, card, auto, deposits, real estate, small business,
large companies, and stuff like that, which is really the underlying thing that drives JPMorgan. It's not whether
they take your revolver from 25% or 27%.
So having said all that, yeah, and I'm not focused on inflation. We simply are pointing out – well, first of all, you
have inflation. It's 4%. It's been 4% now for the better part of a couple of quarters. And it's, in my view, unlikely to
be lower than that next quarter or the quarter after that. And the only question is does it start to ease after that
with supply chains and wages, and more people looking for work, or does it continue to go up? And of course, we
prepare for probabilities and eventualities, and one of those probabilities is that it might go higher than people
think and that they'll have to tamp down. I doubt that'll happen before late 2022.
In the meantime, I think it's unbelievable that we're getting out of this thing and we have 4% unemployment, and
you can have good growth with some inflation, and that's okay. I think that people are always focusing too much
on immediate concerns. If you have inflation of 4% or 5%, we're still going to open deposit accounts and checking
accounts and grow our business.
I also should point out, because it's just always in the back of my mind, of our $30 billion of revenues, $20 billion
is subscription revenues, Asset Management, Commercial Banking, Consumer Banking, which is pretty good,
Wholesale Payments, Securities Services, Custody. And so we're pretty proud with the people who've
accomplished all this, if you look at the actual underlying numbers we're getting earnings per second, more
customers, more accounts, more share. And at the end of the day, that is what drives everything.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Lim Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Okay. That's great. So it seems like you're taking a benign view that it's manageable. It's not going to get out of
hand which is fair enough.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
No. It's the opposite. I'm telling you I don't – it's the opposite. I'm telling you I don't know. We're prepared for all
eventualities. There may be a fat tail of inflation. And one of the things about our balance sheet, you guys talk
about liquidity and stuff like that, one of the fat tails that a bank should be worried about is high inflation and high
rates. And being very liquid protects us more against that than other things.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Lim Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Right. Got it. Thanks for the clarity on that. And just a short follow-on question, Jeremy. Could you update us on
the amount of excess provisions you've got versus your base-case economic scenario? You've given that number
in the past and perhaps a bit of color and also on how that base case has changed over the quarter if it has
indeed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Yeah. So I think the base case – the central case has probably actually gotten a tiny bit worse quarter-on-quarter
in light of the revisions in GDP outlook. But, as you know, the framework also involves looking at probability
weighted scenarios. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the sort of less extreme downside scenarios
contributed a bit to the release this quarter.
In terms of sizing the overall balance, again, as I said in the prepared remarks, they remain a little bit elevated
relative to what they would be if we had this type of economic performance with none of the COVID-related
unusual features, i.e., uncertainty about the virus as much as we are optimistic about that right now, or uncertainty
about labor market conditions or the fact that even though a lot of the essentially all the federal level
unemployment assistance has now rolled off and most of the states have too, there's still some forms of
assistance. The mortgage foreclosure moratorium, student loan stuff, rent moratorium, stuff like that that don't roll
off until later in the year, so there's a number of factors in the environment that are still unusual which do
contribute to slightly elevated reserves relative to what we would otherwise have. And as things play out, those
will develop.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jamie Dimon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Jeremy, just really quickly. I've got to go because I'm out of town I have meetings I have to go to. But you guys
should continue. And folks, thanks for listening to us. We'll talk to you all soon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum A
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
All right. Thanks, Jamie.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And by that, we have no further questions waiting.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Okay. Thanks very much.
