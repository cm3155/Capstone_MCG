Thank you, Julianna. Good morning and thank you, Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our
earning call. I will begin the review of our financial results with slide 3 of our presentation. This morning, we
reported net income of $238 million and earnings per share of a $1.66 for the first quarter of 2022, both up by
37% annualized from the fourth quarter of 2021. The first quarter results were an excellent start to the year.
Highlights include record loans and deposits and acceleration of both loan and revenue growth and expanding net
interest income and positive operating leverage. All of these factors drove pre-tax pre-provision income growth of
28% linked quarter annualized and pre-tax pre-provision profitability of 2.1% in the first quarter.
We returned 1.6% on average asset, 16.5% on average equity and 18% on average tangible equity for the
quarter. All of our profitability ratios expanded. Our high returns reflect our strong financial performance and the
strength of East West business model. Our loan portfolio is well-diversified between the major loan categories of
commercial, commercial real estate and residential mortgage. Our deposit base spans consumer, small business
and corporate commercial accounts. Looking forward with robust pipelines, strong asset quality and a balance
sheet that is well-positioned for rising interest rate environment, we are confident in our ability to execute and
deliver strong growth and earnings for the rest of the year.
Slide 4 presents a summary of our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2022, total loans reached a record high of
$43.5 billion, an increase of 17% annualized as of December 31, 2021. Now excluding Paycheck Protection

Program loans, total loans of $43.2 billion, grew by $2 billion or 20% annualized. Accordingly, based on our
current pipeline and year-to-date results, we are updating our loan growth outlook for the full year to a range of
13% to 15%, up from 12% previously. All our major loan portfolios grew this quarter with the strongest growth
from commercial loans, excluding PPP, followed by commercial real estate.
Total deposit reached a record high of $54.9 billion as of March 31, 2022, up by $1.6 billion or 12% annualized
from December 31, 2021. Deposit growth this quarter was primarily driven by non-interest bearing demand
deposits, which grew to a record $24.9 billion and made up 45% of total deposit as of March 31, 2022, up from
43% from December 31.
Turning to slide 5, quarter-over-quarter, our book value per share declined by 2.5%, largely due to a negative
change in the accumulated other comprehensive income. This change reflected the impact of rising interest rate
on investment securities valuations, and such fluctuations do not have an impact on our earnings or our
regulatory capital ratios. In the exhibit on this slide, you can see our strong capital ratios. As of March 31, 2022,
we had a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.6%, a total capital ratio of 13.9% and a tangible common equity ratio of
8.5%, which provide us with meaningful capacity for future growth. East West Board of Directors has declared
second quarter 2022 dividend for the company's common stock. The quarterly common stock dividend of $0.40 is
payable on May 16, 2022 to stockholders of record on May 2, 2022.
Moving on to a discussion of our loan portfolio, beginning with slide 6, C&I loans outstanding excluding PPP were
record $14.5 billion as of March 31, 2022, an increase of 27% annualized from December 31, 2021. Total C&I
commitments were $20.7 billion as of March 31, sequentially up by a 19% annualized. Our C&I loan utilization
rate increased to 70% as of March 31, up from 69% as of December 31. This is a first quarter-over-quarter
increase in our utilization rate since the first quarter of 2020 when the pandemic began.
Overall, first quarter C&I growth was well diversified across our learning teams, geographies and specialized
verticals. All of our C&I industry segments grew in the first quarter except the oil and gas. Going into the second
quarter, we expect loan growth to be equally well diversified. Slide 7 and 8 show the details of our commercial
real estate portfolio, which is well diversified by geography and property type and consists of low loan to value
loans. Total commercial real estate loans was $17 billion as of March 31, 2022, up by 20% annualized from
December 31. Growth was broad based and all of our commercial real estate segments by geography and by
property type grew in the first quarter. We saw strongest net growth in the industrial, commercial, real estate and
multifamily loans.
In slide 9, we provide details regarding our residential mortgage portfolio, which consists of single family
mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Residential mortgage loans were $11.6 billion as of March 31, 2022,
growing by 11% annualized from December 31. During the first quarter, we originated $1.1 billion of residential
mortgage loans. This origination volume is up 9% quarter-over-quarter and unchanged year-over-year.
I will now turn the call over to Irene to a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement.

Thank you, Dominic. I'll start with our asset quality metrics on slide 10. I'm pleased to report that asset quality of
the loan portfolio continue to be strong [ph] in this first (00:09:55) quarter. The total criticized loan ratio decreased
by 8 basis points sequentially, 1.92% of loans held for investment. Criticized loans of $833 million were essentially
unchanged from December 31. Quarter-over-quarter, non-performing assets decreased by 9%, down to $94

million. The non-performing asset ratio improved by 2 basis points, down to 15 basis points of total assets as of
March 31.
On Slide 11, we present a component of our allowance for loan losses. Our allowance totaled $546 million as of
March 31, or 1.26% of loans excluding PPP, compared with $542 million or 1.32% as of December 31. The
quarter-over-quarter increase in the allowance reflects loan growth, whereas a decrease in the coverage ratio
reflects an improving forecast and improving asset quality. Quarter-over-quarter, net charge offs declined and
were $8 million, down from $10 million in the fourth quarter. The first quarter net charge-off ratio was 8 basis
points of average loans annualized, an improvement from 10 basis points annualized for the fourth quarter.
During the first quarter, we reported a provision for credit losses of $8 million compared to a reversal of $10
million for the fourth quarter, and no provision in the prior year quarter.
And now moving on to discussion of our income statement on slide 12. This slide summarizes the key line items
of the income statement, which I'll discuss in more detail on the following slides. In non-interest income, as part of
the interest rate contracts and other derivatives line item from mark-to-market adjustments, which were a positive
$7.6 million in the first quarter compared with $300,000 in the fourth quarter of 2021. These primarily relate to
favorable changes in the credit valuation adjustment or CVA. On this slide, these CVA marks are included in the
other line item of non-interest income. Amortization of tax credit and other investments in the first quarter was $14
million, compared with $32 million in the fourth quarter.
Quarter-over-quarter variability in amortization of tax credits partially reflects the impact of investments that closed
in a given period. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 was 20% compared to 21% for the fourth
quarter. We currently expect that the 2022 full year effective tax rate will be in the range of 18% to 19%. The
quarterly effective tax rates on a go forward basis will decline as more tax credit investments close and projects
go into service. Correspondingly, the tax credit amortization expense will increase over the course of the year. For
the second quarter of 2022, we currently expect to book a tax credit amortization expense of approximately $37
million.
I'll now reveal the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin starting on slides 13 through 16,
and we'll start with the average balance sheet. First quarter average loans of $42.1 billion, excluding PPP, grew
by $1.8 billion or 19% annualized. The strong loan growth across all asset categories drove a favorable mix shift
in average earning assets quarter-over-quarter. In the first quarter average loans made up 72% of average
earning assets compared with 69% in the prior quarter. First quarter average deposits of $54 billion declined by
$291 million or 2% linked quarter annualized, primarily due to a decrease in non-interest bearing demand
deposits, partially offset by increases in average interest-bearing checking and savings deposits. Demand
deposits made up 43% of our average deposits in the first quarter, compared with 44% in the fourth quarter and
38% in the year ago quarter.
Turning to slide 14, first quarter 2022 net interest income of $416 million was the highest quarterly net interest
income in the history of East West, growing by 10% linked quarter annualized. Excluding PPP, net interest
income grew by 15% annualized in the first quarter. Income related to PPP loans was $5 million in this quarter.
The GAAP net interest margin of 2.87% expanded by 14 basis points quarter-over-quarter. As you can see from
the waterfall chart on this slide, the net interest margin expansion in the first quarter was driven by strong loan
loss, which resulted in the favorable earning asset mix shift, as well as higher yields on loans and other earning
assets.
Turning to slide 15. The first quarter average loan yield was 3.63%, an increase of 4 basis points quarter-over-
quarter. The average low yield comprised an average coupon yield of 3.48%, plus yield adjustments, which

contributed 15 basis points to the overall loan yield in the first quarter. As of March 31, the spot coupon rate on
our total loans was 3.55%. The positive impact of rising interest rates on our portfolio will be more evident in the
second quarter average loan yield, as 33% of our loans are linked to the prime rate, which did not increase until
mid-March. In this slide, we also present the coupon spot rates for each major loan portfolio for the last three
quarter and periods. 65% or $28 billion of our loan portfolio is variable rate, and most of these loans will be
repricing on a monthly basis.
Also note that, of our $28 billion in variable rate loans, $3.1 billion have fully index rates below floors as of March
31, of which $1.7 billion or 50 basis points or less from their floors, and another $700 million, or 50 to 100 basis
points from their floor rate. Turning to slide 16, our average cost of deposits for the first quarter was 10 basis
points, unchanged from the fourth quarter. The spot rate on total deposits was 11 basis points as of March 31, up
by 2 basis points from December 31. We are starting a rising interest rate cycle from a position of strength with
record level of demand deposits for East West Bank, strong liquidity, loan to deposit ratio of under 80%.
Turning to slide 17, total non-interest income in the first quarter was $80 million, up from $71.5 million in the fourth
quarter. Customer-driven fee income and net gains on sales of loans were $65 million, an increase of 3% linked
quarter or 11% annualized. Quarter-over-quarter, customer-driven interest rate contract revenue increased,
reflecting improved customer demand as interest rates rise, wealth management fees, net gains on sales of SBA
loans and deposit account fees also increased quarter-over-quarter.
Moving on slide 18, first quarter non-interest expense was $189 million. Excluding amortization of tax credits and
core deposit intangible amortization, adjusted non-interest expense was a $175 million in the first quarter, down
$3 million, or 1.5% sequentially. During the quarter, decreases in legal expense and overall operating expenses
more than offset increased compensation and employee benefits, which is typically seasonally higher in the first
quarter due to higher payroll taxes and related expenses. The first quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 35%,
compared with 37% in the fourth quarter and 39% in the year ago quarter.
And with that, I'll now review our updated outlook for the full year of 2022 on slide 19. For the full year of 2022,
compared to our full year 2021 actual results, we currently expect year-over-year loan growth, excluding PPP of
approximately 13% to 15%, reflecting year-to-date performance, current loan pipelines, which are very robust.
Our updated outlook is an increase from our previous outlook up 12% loan growth. Year-over-year, net interest
income growth, excluding PPP in the range of 22% to 24%. This is an increase from our previous outlook of net
interest income growth of 17% to 19%.
Our updated outlook reflects loan growth as well as the impact of anticipated Fed funds rate increases on our
asset sensitive balance sheet. Underpinning our interest income assumptions is a forward interest rate curve as
of March 31, 2022, with Fed funds expected to reach 2.50% by year end. Adjusted non-interest expense growth,
excluding tax credit amortization up 8% year-over-year, which narrows our previous outlook of expense growth in
the range of 7% to 8%. As our revenue grows from rising interest rates, we expect to reinvest a portion back into
our business, investing in people and technology to support our strategic initiatives. We expect our revenue and
expense outlook to result in positive operating leverage year-over-year.
In terms of the credit items, for 2022, we currently expect that the provision for credit losses will be in the range of
$50 million to $60 million. This is higher compared with our previous outlook, which was for provision for credit
losses under $50 million. We continue to anticipate a modest year-over-year improvement in the full year net
charge-off ratio, which was 13 basis points of average loans in 2021. We now expect that the full year 2022
effective tax rate will be approximately 18% to 19%. This is higher compared with our previous outlook, which was
for an effective tax rate of 17% to 18%. Our outlook includes impact of tax credit investments. It also factors in the

increased income we now expect. There will be quarterly variability in the tax rate due to timing of tax credit
investments placed into service.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Dominic for closing remarks.

Thank you, Irene. Well, in closing, we are off to an excellent start for the year, and look forward to delivering
strong financial results for our shareholders in 2022. Global volatility notwithstanding, we are well positioned to
navigate the current environment. Our credit quality is strong. Our balance sheet is asset sensitive. We have
strong capital and ample liquidity to support growth. But most importantly, our associates are focused on
providing superior banking service to our customers. I wish to thank them for their efforts and excellent results.

Just firstly, I mean, it sounds like you're relatively optimistic for the loan growth outlook. Would love to hear a little
more detail around just how borrower demand played out during the course of the quarter. And have you seen
incremental supply chain snags impacting customer sentiment since the war began at the end of Feb? And just in
terms of, when you think about loan growth from here, if you could give us a sense of CRE versus C&I versus
residential, how you think that mix playing out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
In terms of the loan growth, we are looking at our pipelines. If I look at the current pipelines, a lot of the C&I loans
that we are working on, whether some of the private equity or entertainment, technology and healthcare, and
other general manufacturing and consumer goods and so forth, all of these business that we've been working on
with the clients. So it's all in the process of trying to make it happen in the second quarter. So we feel pretty good
about what's coming, and then how to what extent that business will or will not be affected by the external
environment.

We feel pretty good about a lot of the deals in the pipeline, really would not be having much impact by, for
example, this Russia-Ukraine war, is so tragic from a humanitarian perspective, but there's really, hardly any
bearing to our customers' business that we're dealing with. And that's one for the C&I. For the commercial real
estate, again, we have clients that are in the midst of maybe closing deals that we are working with. And so those
are the deals that we feel pretty certain again in the second quarter would be closing. Same thing for the single
family mortgages.
What's in our pipeline is something that we expected that to be funded. It takes certain period of time to get loans
funded. So we feel pretty good about what we expect to be coming out in the second quarter. Obviously, the
longer the horizon, the harder for us to predict. You ask us about what would your fourth quarter loan growth
would be like. Well, at this point, we don't have as much visibility as we have for the second quarter, because
second quarter we see the numbers that we're working on, it looks very healthy. But how, let's say, the third and
fourth quarter will develop, I think that external environment will have a lot to do with it, and then we'll see how it
goes.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

Okay. And just one bigger picture question, Dominic, if I may. There's a lot of chatter for a bank that has cross-
border presence in China, there's been a fair amount of discussion on de-globalization, potential for further
deterioration in US-China relationship. How do you handicap and protect the bank from a risk standpoint? The
fact that [indiscernible] (00:25:35) sentiment around the stocks. Would love to hear how you think about managing
risk if US-China relations were to deteriorate further.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, we don't necessarily protect bank from these challenges. We actually excel in these challenges. East West
have always done extraordinarily well whenever there are some things that from a perception standpoint looks
bad, and in reality we actually have come out way ahead of our peer banks. But let me just address your concern
maybe one by one, first and foremost, I've said it before, our Greater China, including China and Hong Kong loan
portfolio is only 5% of our total loans, and 95% of our loans are domestic in the US, and that includes like
commercial real estate, that's as local as you can get, because as real estate you cannot move it, which is 39% of
total loans, and residential mortgage is 27% of our total loans.
So our loan portfolio in China, Hong Kong, also is very well diversified by industry, ranging from general
manufacturing, consumer goods, technology, entertainment, to digital media, et cetera. And the credit profile of
these customers also is excellent, with strong balance sheet and high level of liquidity across all of our loan
portfolio. So I will say that, in both China and US, it all comes down to diversification and granularity are the most
important factor for us to manage risk. So I feel pretty good about you look at so much of our – 95% of our total
loan portfolio out of that are based in US, and majority of them are either residential or commercial real estate.
And then many of the domestic C&I loans from entertainment, our private equity, healthcare and digital media are
all domestic in nature.
So the exposure from China is very minimal as to begin with. And even within China, that 5% are very, very
strong credit quality business and is also well-diversified. So from that perspective, we feel very, very comfortable
where we are today. Now, but going back to what I talked about, we don't necessarily look at, we need to protect
from the US-China dynamic. We actually excel is that, when we look at US-China scenario, we actually always
find opportunities when people shy away from it. And the fact that you have seen what we have done in the last
four years, in fact, I would say five-and-a-half years now, ever since the beginning of the Trump administration

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
that US declared trade war against China. Yes, there is clearly disruption to the international trade per se. But
East West was able to find our niches and we continue to have pristine asset quality that we didn't take any
losses due to this sort of trade tariff that went on for few years.
And we continue to find way to grow the business. So I looked at it as, when you looked at where we are today,
and then we can reflect back on maybe, for the last 30 years I've been involved with East West Bank, and in
1991, so we doubled our size during the [indiscernible] (00:29:32) financial crisis in 2009. We doubled our size
during the global financial crisis. Well, today, we weren't able to just double our size in one year, but since the
Trump administration started taking on the reign in US in 2017 to today, we've doubled our size also. We took a
little bit longer, but we doubled our size organically. So all I'm trying to get at is that East West Bank always will
find a way to grow our business, and we have history to demonstrate that in 30 years and that's facts, that's not
rhetorics.
And the other thing I wanted to point out is that, going back to your concern about deglobalization or maybe
decoupling between US and China, if you talk to the expert in the business, by the way, I'm talking about even
political expert, the US Trade Representative, Katherine Tai; Janet Yellen, who is the Secretary of Treasury,
Raimondo, who's the Secretary of Commerce, and each and every one of them have never once declared that
US wanted to decouple. In fact, they all continuously highlight that engagement. But we do need to find a way to
more effectively engage with China. Those are the kind of words coming out from these sort of expert in the area.
There are other experts, obviously, that you see it from the media that talked about, yes, US, China, we need to
decouple, and so forth and de-globalization, but those are the folks that are selling books and selling military
weapons.
So really on that, the same, like the one who actually we need to run the business. We at East West Bank, we are
expert in terms of managing our book of business. We understand US-China relationship better than most
everyone in the country. We're in the risk management business. So we feel very confident about where we are
today in terms of the credit quality and the potential risk of the US-China decoupling, which quite frankly is
extremely unlikely. And in addition to that, we also feel that, besides the unlikelihood of decoupling, that
globalization in the world is also extremely unlikely. It took about 40 years or so for the world to work together with
China to create a supply chain infrastructure. It's not that easy to de-globalize it in five, 10 or even 20 years.
And it's something that once people really understand the nuances and exactly what it takes to build this supply
chain, and they understand that it's never going to be that easy to have this decoupling, I think that US-China
would just have to continue to work through their differences. And there are challenges in terms of philosophical
differences, values and so forth. They're going to need to find a way to work it through. What we've noticed just
recently, China, in fact, The People's Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on April I
think just issued 23 measures to help business impact by the pandemic, and six of those measures directly
related easing of cross-border trade and payments. So those are kind of things that China has been working on to
try and to make sure they can get the economy going also.
And every now and then, when we see these kind of opportunities comes out, those are opportunities that East
West also will be able to take advantage of. And the key things for us when we get down to the end is that, we are
a bank that have very unique value proposition. We understand that business, and we have shown for many
years and have proven for many years, we know how to navigate through this US-China relationship, and
continue to be able to have sustainable growth. And we feel very confident that in the next many years we'll
continue to be able to outperform our peer banks because of this unique value proposition.

Hey. Great. Thanks for the question. Dominic, I just wanted to dig into the guide a little bit, really good outlook. I'm
having a little trouble getting to your net interest income. I think my notes suggest it should be a little bit higher
given the growth in the margin setup. So I guess the question is, what are the assumptions embedded for deposit
growth, deposit betas, maybe the missing component is the size of the balance sheet, but it feels like the guide is
awfully conservative.

Well, Chris, I'm glad to hear you say that. We're very tired, and I wanted to just start by saying we're very positive
on the outlook, and our ability to execute, as Dominic mentioned, the pipeline is very strong, particularly as we're
going into the second quarter. With that said, though, I think we're also realistic of the increased kind of macro
uncertainty, with the war, rising rates as well, although we have no direct exposure to the war in Europe. So with
that said, and when we're modeling out, when we also use multi scenarios as far as looking up, we share during
the last call that we started this year when we thought rates were going to increase 100 basis points at a deposit
beta assumption for the full year of 30%.
So we're definitely higher from that, Chris, as we're modeling for the full year given rates are expected to increase
a bit more than that. And also related to that, I would say that, when we're looking on the asset side, I think we're
trying to be conservative as far as we're positive about the loan growth. But in this type of rising rate environment
without any credit issues, I think we're trying to be conservative about kind of any kind of spread pressures that
might be there. With that said, I just want to say, we are starting this environment, a rising rate environment, from
a position of strength, best ever at East West, record DDAs 43% of average deposits, 45% at period end, and
then a loan deposit under 80%. And we've talked about it before, we have operated and comfortable operating up
until low 90s.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thank you for that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. One thing I want to point out also at is that, we normally, East West Bank normally built momentum more
like in the third and fourth quarter, and in the first quarter, normal, I wouldn't call it a struggle. First quarter
normally is like a [indiscernible] (00:37:30). But this year, I think we are in a much substantial better position. We
have a very strong quarter and we feel that our pipeline in the second quarter looks pretty decent. And so once
you get two strong quarters in a row, and pretty much we feel pretty good that for the rest of the year, it's hard to
not have strong financial performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thank you for that. I guess my follow up would be, the beta helps, Irene, on the increase in betas. What
are you assuming for deposit growth, because we've seen some of your peers with commercial books have
notable kind of chunkiness. This quarter, I was just wondering, but you guys had double-digit growth. I'm just
trying to get a little bit more color on what you're assuming for just deposit flows.

Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. We are not assuming the same level of deposit growth as we are on the loan side, as we just talked about.
Realistically, we don't think we need it. And also, realistically, in this kind of environment, the kind of deposit
growth that we had in 2021, 2020, probably not likely to occur. So we are expecting a lower level of deposit
growth. But still, I would also comment that all our team leaders, all our RMs, and our cash management sales
team, are all very busy bringing in and core deposits, which we expect to continue to grow from retail and
commercial customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Let me just also highlight that we have not de-emphasized deposit growth, despite the fact that we have
this kind of loan-to-deposit ratio. But we are getting all our frontline people to focus on growing core deposits.
Core deposits we want every time, every – any day. But what I'm looking at is that, if you look at the deposit
growth last year, in fact, the last two years, we actually accommodated our clients' excess liquidity quite a bit. We
really did not need that kind of deposit growth for the last two years, but these are good clients. They have
tremendous excess liquidity, and we are more than happy to accommodate them. But I just don't see that our
clients will continue to have this kind of excess liquidity. So we do expect that the deposit growth would taper
quite a bit from last year.

David Rochester Q

I was wondering if you could just dig into the non-interest bearing deposit growth for the quarter, that was
exceptional. And it is, as you guys have noted previously, or I guess, Chris have noted previously, that not that
many of your competitors were able to put up numbers like that this quarter on that trend. So just wondering, is
that primarily the treasury management guys efforts that are driving that, or is there anything else that's driving
that growth? And then how are you thinking about that going forward? And then I have a follow up after that.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
Yeah. Dave, there wasn't anything really unusual as far as the nature of the deposit growth. Some of our
customers with the activity they have honestly and their businesses, balances were up, especially compared to
the average for the quarter point to point, nothing unusual or no industries or anything specific. But as I
mentioned, the teams are hard at work bringing in core deposits. So that's something we expect to continue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. So you're expecting to continue to see that non-interest bearing growth remain pretty healthy here in the
near term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Maybe, I'll clarify. I definitely expect we will be bringing on more core deposits. Core deposits, operating
accounts and with that, growing DDA balances. With that said, there is a certain amount of liquidity that with the
rising rate environment, there may be disintermediation into other asset classes, other deposits, and I think we're
realistic about that. But overall, growing core deposits, customers, that's something we're very positive about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
How are you guys thinking about using the earnings credit rate from here to keep that growth going in non-interest
bearing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Certainly that's a factor for some of our clients, Dave. The way that we look at it, we're very practical to
these [indiscernible] (00:42:11), whether you pay out of interest expense or non-interest expense, we view it the
same way. So, we all look at that in a different way. We look at the economics of that.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, that's a great question. Overall, there wasn't anything unusual. I'll draw your attention to slide 17 of our
deck, where we break out the mark to market. Now, that's not unusual, but it fluctuates and quarter over quarter,
and the marked – positive mark to market was higher for the CBA adjustment. But aside from that, from a core fee
income perspective, FX, wealth management, the IRC and the deposit accounts, we expect to continue to grow
that year-over-year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then on the securities portfolio, it looks like was that a reclass of securities into held-to-
maturity or you actually buying different product class to start building that out. And how should we be thinking
about the breakdown of securities and the growth of that going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, great question. During the quarter, in fact, effective February 1, we transferred $3 billion of our AFS
securities into HTM on a go forward basis. And just depending on the duration, there may be new securities we
purchase into held-to-maturity. Quarter-to-date for the second quarter, there's been a little bit, but not significant.
So that mix, I don't think it will change dramatically the pace of what we'll buy into that, depending on rates and
depending on kind of our expectation around what's happening with that in our portfolio. We'll buy more, but
probably at a lower level.

Operator: Our next question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Irene, maybe just following up on that question on the securities book. Is
there an appetite to maybe run that, that securities portfolio lower as a percentage of earning assets and
potentially fund some of this loan growth going forward from there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, absolutely. I think that is something we would evaluate, just kind of depending on kind of what the spreads
that we're earning and what makes sense as far as our overall balance sheet. As you know, we generally look at
the securities book really to make sure that we have enough of liquidity and we're not necessarily trying to balloon
that out. But certainly with the rising rate environment, this is something that we're having more discussions with
our ALCO committee as well as far as what the right mix is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, very good. And just following up on the loan growth, you guys are off to a very strong start, 20% linked
quarter annualized with C&I commitments up 20%, which is very positive leading indicator on the potential growth
near-term. I know there's obviously a lot of visibility into the fourth quarter, but just wondering why the loan growth
guide is in a little bit stronger than that mid-teens levels? Is it just general conservatism or do you see something
more substantial to slow down the loan growth going forward?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I think as we said earlier, we look at where we are today, we are very pleased that the fourth quarter
momentum continued to spilled over into the first quarter and then looking at second quarter, still got a lot of legs
going. I mean, so that's all good. And then what I like most about it is that, it's coming from all different sectors.
So, this whole thing that we worked so hard for the last ten years to get more granular to more diversified portfolio
is working exactly what we planned almost a decade ago. And so, multiple engines are all producing and then we
always looked at it, and one particular period of time, maybe a few of them would do better than the others. And
then everything's kind of evened out, but well, it just happened that the last two or three quarters in a row that we
actually have multiple factors, multiple units all going strong.
Now, that said, as I said earlier, we have inflation today that is at a somewhat of a unprecedented situation for the
last decade or two. And then we also have – this war going on between Russia and Ukraine, which while I said
that we have no bearing to East West Bank business, the fact is, it is clearly a fact of macroeconomic
environment. And so, when we start looking at all these different things and the pandemic is not over yet. We do
need to have to be realistic about to what extent, how would interest rate spike by the Fed would affect, for
example, the residential market. And to that extent [indiscernible] (00:48:11) some point of time, the rate get high
enough that make it not likely for people to do transactions.
So, we look – we take that into effect and I would say that I don't want to get too overly excited about what just
because it's momentum going so strong now that maybe by the fourth quarter, we're still seeing that kind of
momentum. Now, I do have one way to look at it from a positive note is that, one, there is maybe a less mortgage
origination for single family. There is less paydown too. So, net-net, the growth rate may not be that negatively
impacted even with a rate hike. Same thing for commercial real estate. We're not going to originate as many CRE,
I would think, in the second half of this year. However, there'll be less paydown. So, net-net, our loan growth may
still be very strong. But that's what we hope the direction is going to be. But without having a lot of clarity about
the interest rates spike impact, how exactly does Russia and Ukraine situation would develop and to what extent
will affect the overall global supply chain and how pandemic would actually continue to have new variants coming
up, all of that, if we start looking at it, I do feel that we wanted to make sure we're being prudent to project the
second half of the year.

Hey, I had a few questions on loan growth. Some of the answers may have been implied in some previous

maybe potential upside there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I think that's also the power we [indiscernible] (00:51:03), right. We're going to be able to grow without
utilization increases and that's [indiscernible] (00:51:07).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got it. Got it. And then for CRE, that was strong as well. I want to know how much of the growth in the first
quarter, how much of that would contribute to slower paydowns?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
There definitely was a decrease in paydowns in the first quarter, especially compared to if you look at the back
half of last year, but I would also say we had increased originations. So, the combination of both, Brandon.

Operator: Our next question comes from Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vilas Abraham Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, everyone. [indiscernible] (00:51:48) Vilas Abraham for Brock, I just wanted to dig into resi mortgage for a
minute. I get that your business model is a bit different than most. But even given that the origination volume
seems pretty resilient here, just flat year-over-year when most competitors are down. Is there a share gain
happening there? Is there any other color you can offer around that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, actually, relatively speaking, I mean if you recall going back to our earnings release for the last few years,
residential mortgage always that the leading category in terms of our loan growth, always outgrew CRE or CNI for
the last few years. And actually two quarters in a row, residential mortgages are falling behind compared to the
other two relatively, relatively speaking, and which is obviously by nature if you look at the external environment, I

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
would expect that residential mortgage growth will continue to be more challenging. As you look at it, we used to
have like 20-plus-percent growth a couple of years ago, we're down to 11% in the first quarter and we expect that
the second quarter maybe down even a little bit more. And then I would expect that even by the fourth quarter
maybe down to single digit, so that's the way I looked at it is that the external environment and make the
refinancing very challenging and it may also discourage homebuyers to purchase home when rates spike to over
five [indiscernible] (00:53:39) over 5%. It would be like when you get to even 6% or something, it's going to be
very discouraging for homebuyers to buy home.
So, the likelihood that we do a lot of resi refi or purchases is low. Now that said as I just said earlier, paydown will
drop substantially because for the last few years we just churned a lot of the loans, like we originate in high
volume. We also have paydown in a high volume, simply because many of our existing customers just refinance
their mortgages for a lower rate and we just do a lot – a bunch of work for [ph] the same net (00:54:19) number.
So, I looked at it in 2022, particularly the latter half of the year. I would say that the origination volume should drop
substantially. However, the paydown also would drop substantially. Hopefully, we'll still have some net growth but
we'd pretty much expect that in 2022 the majority of the loan growth will be coming from C&I and CRE and less so
from single family mortgages.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vilas Abraham Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. That's very helpful. And just as my follow up and maybe slightly bigger picture question, so this rate hike,
rate hike cycle has barely started and the efficiency ratio at East West is already – looks to already be below
where it was when the last hike cycle was well underway. So, just wanted to see if you could help us understand
just what may have changed in the profile here that's helping you guys achieve such stellar efficiency and maybe
even a sense of how low it could reasonably go over time? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, we never manage the bank to the efficiency ratio. I think that's something that we've made clear on these
calls. And that certainly isn't something that's in any of our metrics or our drivers. But with that said, and also
related to that, we have continued to make the investments that we think are appropriate for the bank, for our
clients, for our strategies. And I think those continued investments and successful investments are part of the
reason our efficiency is low, if you look at it. The other side of it really is if you look at our balance sheet and the
composition, simply we're well-positioned right now for a rising rate environment. Credit is also very benign,
although obviously not factored into the efficiency ratio. But nonetheless, the additional kind of operating costs
related to a credit cycle are not here.
So, I think it's the combination of all of these factors. But certainly, that's something that will be very important for
us as we go forward. We're continuing to make the investments that we think are appropriate and then also reap
the reward on the revenue side.

Thanks. Good morning. My questions have largely been asked and answered. But just regarding the guide on the

factors, any changes to the CECL model that are driving that number any harder.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A

scenarios as far as for CECL calculation. So, just evaluating that and with a little bit of the uncertainty for the
future. With that said, I think I said in our prepared remarks as well, credit quality is very benign, continues to be.

Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, good morning. First question just on the trade finance portfolio, can you just remind us how big that portfolio
is at the end of the first quarter and how that portfolio has performed from a growth perspective with the supply
chain disruption freeing up to some degree?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, in terms of that portfolio, I think that it's going, it's just going fine. I mean, we have not have much – for the
last four years, we have not had much growth in that portfolio. I mean, naturally so from a trade finance
perspective, I mean, there's a couple of reasons. One is that with the trade tariff plus the pandemic that affect the
supply chain. And also, we have to recognize that the international trade finance business, it's really something I
would say is more or less like an older business model. With the advance in technology, we have less and less of
that, that require the traditional international trade finance from banks. A lot of the payments today done
electronically are much easier and faster.
So, we at East West Bank, actually, while we are actively involved with the cross-border banking business, a lot of
our cross-border banking business actually are involved with some e-commerce and then to digital media and
entertainment business and private equity business. And then most of those business that there are cross-border
elements but not necessarily require us to provide letter of credit support and so forth. Yeah, so that's what we
are. But the business is still going solid and I don't know, Irene, do you have any numbers that you wanted to
share?

Irene H. Oh A

million.

Matthew T. Clark Q

Okay. Thank you. And then just a housekeeping item. I think you gave us the amortization expense for the
upcoming quarter of $37 million. How should we model that for the full year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So, Matt, for the second quarter, we gave you the $37 million. And then if you look in our slide deck on the outlook
slide, we also provide for you our expectations for the full year amortization expense in the range of $110 million
to $125 million. And it's a range because it kind of depends on when projects close and go into service and kind of
the mix of the projects. So, I would say is that picked up second half of the year and at this point probably split it
evenly between the two quarters.
