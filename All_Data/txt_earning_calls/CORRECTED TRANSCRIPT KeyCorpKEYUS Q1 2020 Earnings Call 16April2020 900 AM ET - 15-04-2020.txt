Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Hello and welcome to KeyCorp's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. As a reminder, this call is being
recorded.
At this time, I'd like to pass it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Chris Gorman. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, KeyCorp
Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call.
Joining me on the call today are Beth Mooney, our Chief Executive Officer; Don Kimble, our Chief Financial
Officer; and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer.
Slide 2 is our statement of forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our
presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.
I'm now turning to slide 3. It is an extraordinary time with the spread of COVID-19 causing a heavy human toll
throughout the country, and has impacted all of our daily lives in ways none of us could have anticipated. Despite
the unprecedented challenges we are facing, I've been encouraged by our collective strength and resiliency and
I'm confident that this resiliency will carry us through this crisis.
So let me start by giving you a brief overview on where things stand here at Key. First, our business resiliency
plans are in effect and we have maintained our operational effectiveness across our organization. In every
decision we have made, the health and safety of our clients, colleagues and communities in which we operate
have remained our top priority.
Secondly, we are committed to playing a critical role in providing capital and assistance to our clients and
supporting broader initiatives to strengthen our economy. To-date, we have approved over 11,000 credit
extensions and more than 38,000 applications have been submitted through the newly introduced Payroll (sic)
[Paycheck] Protection Program.
I'm now moving to slide 4. I want to address our financial outlook which in the near term will be impacted by the
economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, we are operating from a position of strength. Our
business model and clear strategy position us well during this period of economic and financial stress, but
importantly will provide us with significant opportunities through the recovery phase. I want to affirm our long-term
targets have not changed. And on the other side of this crisis, we expect to continue to deliver positive operating
leverage and strong financial returns.
In this environment, credit quality also plays a critical role. Although some would continue to view Key through the
lens of the financial crisis, the reality is that we are a different company today in terms of our strategy, our risk
profile and our leadership team.
We have significantly reduced our exposure to high-risk sectors and industries, and have positioned Key to
perform well through all phases of the business cycle, including highly stressed environments like the one in
which we are operating today. Our moderate risk profile also informs our credit decisions and the way we
underwrite loans. Don will share more detail with respect to our credit measures and our adoption of CECL.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
The final section of this slide focuses on capital and liquidity, both clear strengths for our company. Key, along
with other major banks, have participated in several rounds of government-mandated stress tests since the
financial crisis. These tests have shown that Key would remain well capitalized through periods of severe
economic and financial stress, while continuing to support our clients. Our liquidity position also remains strong
with a combined $50 billion in liquid assets and unused borrowing capacity.
Let me close my remarks by reaffirming our confidence in the long-term outlook for our company. Although our
industry clearly faces near-term challenges, we believe the steps we have taken over the past decade to
strengthen and reposition our company will set Key apart.
We have a consistent and targeted business strategy focused on relationships. We have a strong capital position
and disciplined approach in the manner in which we deploy our capital. We have significant sources of liquidity.
We have dramatically de-risked our company over the last several years. And also, we have a management team
that is dedicated to helping our clients and our communities manage through these challenging times.
And finally, since this is Beth Mooney's last earnings call as CEO, I want to acknowledge the outstanding
leadership she has provided our company. Beth will offer a few remarks after Don, but I just want to say it is not
lost on any of us that our strong foundation and clear sense of purpose is in no small part due to Beth's leadership
over the past nine years. As I have said before, I could not have asked for a better partner, and we wish her well
in the next stage of her journey.
With that, let me turn the call over to Don to report on the quarter.

Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Thanks, Chris. I'm now on slide 6. This morning, we reported first quarter net income from continuing operations
of $0.12 per common share. The current quarter's results have clearly been impacted by COVID-19 pandemic
whose impacts include provision expense exceeded net charge-offs by $275 million. Timing is everything.
In the first quarter CECL, we experienced the impact of a global pandemic. Through February, our credit quality
and economic outlook resulted in a stable allowance for loan losses compared to January 1 level. The vast
majority of the increase reflects the changed economic outlook.
Market-related valuation adjustments totaled $92 million. These adjustments include $73 million of reserves on
our customer derivatives, reflecting the market-implied default rates given the significant increase in credit
spreads. The remainder of $19 million is due to trading losses or portfolio marks, once again related to the
widening credit spreads in the market.
One other area of impact was our investment banking debt placement fees. The actual results for the quarter are
approximately $40 million below our expectations in the pipeline from just a month ago. I'll cover many of the
remaining items on this slide in the rest of my presentation.
Turning to slide 7, total average loans were $96 billion, up 7% from the first quarter of last year, driven by growth
in both commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans reflect about $7 billion in growth in the month of
March alone, including increased line draws and short-term liquidity facilities provided to customers.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
It's important to note that approximately 70% of the C&I draws in March came from investment-grade customers.
Consumer loans benefited from the strong growth from Laurel Road and our residential mortgage business.
Laurel Road originated $600 million of student consolidation loans this quarter, and we generated $1.3 billion of
residential mortgage loans. The investments we have made in these areas continue to drive results and
importantly adding high-quality loans to our portfolio.
Linked-quarter average loan balances were up 3%. For next quarter, line draws and other commercial loan
growth are expected to slow from the March level. We will, however, show strong growth, reflecting the impact of
the PPP program.
As Chris mentioned, we have processed over 38,000 applications representing $9 billion of requests and the
fundings are occurring quickly. This program is critical to our customers and we are pleased to support these
efforts.
Importantly, we have remained disciplined with our credit underwriting and we have walked away from business
that does not meet our moderate risk profile. We are a different company than we were a decade ago. We remain
committed to performing well through the business cycle and we manage our credit quality with this longer-term
perspective.
Continuing on to slide 8, average deposits totaled $110 billion for the first quarter of 2020, up $3 billion or 3%
compared to a year-ago period and down 2% from prior quarter. The linked quarter decline reflects the expected
reduction in several temporary deposit balances early in the quarter.
Growth from the prior year was driven by both consumer and commercial clients. It's also important to note that
deposit flows since February have funded the loan growth, continuing to support our strong liquidity position.
Total interest-bearing deposit costs came down 14 basis points from the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of
lower interest rates and the associated lag in pricing. We would also expect deposit costs to continue to decline
approximately 30 to 35 basis points in the second quarter. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base
with consumer deposits accounting for 65% of our total deposit mix.
Turning to slide 9, taxable equivalent net interest income was $989 million for the first quarter of 2020 compared
to $985 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $987 million in the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 3.01%
for this quarter compared to 3.13% for the first quarter of 2019 and 2.98% for the prior quarter.
Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased $2 million, driven by an improved balance sheet mix
and strong loan growth. Our net interest margin for the quarter reflects the improved balance sheet mix.
Looking into the second quarter, as a result of expected originations of the PPP loans, we would expect net
interest income to increase from the first quarter level. Net interest margin should decline as the yield on these
loans is lower than other loan products.
Moving to slide 10, Key's non-interest income was $477 million for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $536
million for the year-ago quarter and $651 million in the prior quarter. The current quarter clearly reflected the
impact of the pandemic on our market-sensitive businesses.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
Other income, a negative $88 million for the quarter, reflected $92 million of market-related valuation adjustments.
This included $73 million of reserves for our customer derivatives due to significant increases in credit spreads.
The cumulative reserve recorded for this portfolio now exceeds the total losses recognized in this area through
the Great Recession.
The reserves will come down if credit spreads narrow from March 31 levels. The remaining portion of the market-
related valuation adjustments include $19 million of trading losses or marks, also driven by the increased credit
spreads.
Two other areas of note, operating lease income for the quarter included an $8 million valuation adjustment. And
consumer mortgage income reflected $1.3 billion of originations with higher gain on sales levels offset by $9
million of MSR impairment. Going into the second quarter, we would not expect further meaningful market-related
valuation adjustments. Most other fee income categories would be down slightly, reflecting lower activity levels.
Investment banking and debt placement fees are challenging to predict at this time.
Now turning to slide 11, expense levels trended down this quarter as the results reflect the benefit of efficiency
improvements and lower variable compensation. Adjusting for notable items in the prior quarter compared to the
year-ago period, non-interest expense declined $6 million despite the addition of Laurel Road in April 2019.
Compared to the prior quarter, adjusting for notable items, non-interest expense declined $27 million. Lower
incentive compensation costs correlated to revenues contributed to this decline. Business services and marketing
both were down seasonally this quarter.
Turning to slide 12, CECL was adopted January 1 of this year, resulting in an increase to our allowance for loan
losses as of the end of the year of $204 million, consistent with previous disclosures. Through February, our
CECL reserves remain very stable, reflecting the credit quality of the portfolio, and the economic forecasts were
consistent with the start of the year.
By the end of the quarter, the economic outlook changed considerably, reflecting the expected impact of the
pandemic. While no one knows the depth or duration of the economic downturn, we updated our CECL reserves
to incorporate a severe downturn in economic activity with the recovery beginning late in the year. This change in
economic outlook resulted in provision expense exceeding net charge-offs by $275 million.
As we progress through the current quarter, we will better be able to refine our outlook, including the potential
depth and duration of the downturn. It should also provide additional insights into the benefit from the various
programs implemented by our government to help our customers and the economy.
Now turning to slide 13, despite the build in our allowances, our credit quality metrics remain strong as of March
31. Net charge-offs were $84 million or 35 basis points of average of total loans in the first quarter, which
continues to be below our over-the-cycle range of 40 to 60 basis points.
Non-performing loans were $632 million in the quarter, reflecting a $45 million increase from our reclassification
resulting from the adoption of CECL. Adjusted for this reclassification, NPLs increased $10 million from the prior
quarter.
Non-performing loans represent 61 basis points of period end loans, flat with the prior quarter and prior year.
Criticized loans increased modestly, reflecting the impact of market conditions and loan rating changes in our oil
and gas portfolio.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
During March, the increase in commercial line draws and temporary liquidity facilities generally related to our
highly rated customers. At the end of the quarter, the percent of our commercial loan book outstanding to
investment-grade customers actually increased by 200 basis points.
One other area we continue to monitor is the level of assistance requests from our customers. As of the end of
last week, we had received approximately 11,000 requests from our retail customers, about 0.7% of accounts. We
also received approximately 800 similar requests from our commercial customers. While this is still early, request
levels have been less than we originally expected.
Turning to slide 14, we received questions about the exposure to certain industry or customer groups given the
current environment. Included on this slide is a summary of those areas. As you can see, most of those areas
represent a small portion of the overall portfolio and are diversified by type and geography.
We have implemented an enhanced monitoring process, providing more active reviews, often weekly, of
relationships that might be more vulnerable to the current environment. The outstanding balances shown are of
March 31, and reflect some of the draw activity that occurred late in the quarter.
Now on to slide 15, capital ratios this quarter reflected the impact of the balance sheet growth and lower earnings.
Most of our planned capital actions for the quarter were completed before the economic outlook turned. As a
result, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 8.95% as of March 31, down 49 basis points from year-end. This level
is slightly below our target range, but well above the stress capital buffer levels required by the Fed.
Our capital target was established to provide sufficient capital to operate in stressed environments, recognizing
we would be operating at levels below the target as we experience the impact of those environments. This capital
level provides a sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs, and based on
our current outlook, maintain our dividend.
As a reminder, our capital priorities continue to be to support organic growth, to continue our strong common
dividend, to repurchase shares with excess capital. The new guidelines for the stress capital buffer are also
helpful in addressing our capital actions. As announced earlier, we suspended our share buybacks through the
second quarter.
On slide 16, we provided our best insights and high-level comments for the second quarter. Given the uncertain
economic outlook for the full year, we have removed our guidance for full year 2020. There is still a wide range of
scenarios on the depth and duration of the economic downturn. Also impacting this will be the benefit of various
programs to help bridge the retail and commercial customers.
As we move through the second quarter, we expect to have more clarity on the economic impact of COVID-19
and the support provided to our clients, allowing us to provide more visibility on our full year outlook.
Loan growth should remain strong, reflecting the balances as of the end of the first quarter, the production levels
expected from the PPP loan program and continued strength in our commercial and consumer loan originations.
Deposits will show good growth, driven by both consumer and commercial areas. This growth would support
much of the loan growth noted above.
Net interest income is expected to be up from the first quarter level driven by growth in loans. We expect net
interest margin to decline, reflecting the dilutive impact of the PPP program. For non-interest income, we would

not expect further meaningful market-related valuation adjustments. Most other fee income categories would be
down slightly, reflecting lower activity levels.
Investment banking and debt placement fees are challenging to predict at this time. Non-interest expenses are
expected to be relatively stable for next quarter. Net charge-offs should increase slightly to around the lower end
of our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points. The environment continues to change rapidly, which can impact the
outlook in the comments we've provided.
Finally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets. Given the economic downturn, we would not
expect to achieve all these targets this year. However, as we emerge from the current crisis, we expect to be back
on the path that would lead us to operate within these targeted ranges. Importantly, we have not wavered from
our commitment to achieve our long-term targets.
Before we turn the call back over to the operator, Beth would like to add some closing comments. Beth?

Beth Elaine Mooney
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, KeyCorp
Thank you, Don, and good morning. It's with a lot of mixed feelings that I approach the end of my time at Key and
as I've said before, being the CEO of this great company has been the privilege and the highlight of my career.
And I will always be proud to have been part of this team.
I've also enjoyed meeting many of you on the line today and recognize the important work you do for our industry.
I've been at Key for 14 years, and 9 years of those as our CEO. And I've worked with some incredibly talented
and dedicated individuals. And collectively, we have created a different company, financially strong, values-based
and dedicated to providing unparalleled service to our clients, never more important than the times we find
ourselves in.
In addition to serving on Key's board of directors, I also had the privilege of serving on the boards of some of the
leading industrial, technology and health care providers in the country, which provides me with a vantage point
across a large part of our economy. And while I recognize the near-term challenges, I continue to see strong
underlying business that will weather the current environment and lead us through to the recovery phase.
Let me wrap things up with a comment on our CEO transition. Chris will assume the role as KeyCorp's CEO on
May 1, and our transition has been very smooth and seamless. I am confident in Chris, and in our leadership
team, and indeed, of all of our teammates, who are fully engaged and committed to not only navigate the current
environment, but ultimately take our company to the next level and deliver value for all of our stakeholders.
And with that, let me turn the call back to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go to the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you for taking the question. So first, Beth, congratulations and best wishes in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Beth Elaine Mooney A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, KeyCorp
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. So the question I wanted to ask, Don, maybe it's most appropriate for you. Just a little more detail, please,
on the assumptions that went into the CECL reserve, maybe anticipated GDP contraction, unemployment, et
cetera. And then maybe just a follow-up. What, in your mind, would it take to require a repeat of the level of
reserve build from the 1Q in future quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. Great question, Scott. And as far as our economic scenarios, we used a number of the recent Moody's
scenarios to forecast, to inform our CECL reserve, that each of these scenarios included a severe reduction in
GDP and a significant increase in unemployment levels. I would say that our outlook assumed GDP will be
negative through the third quarter and still be in the high single-digit range as far as negative GDP impact, and
then also unemployment would also be in the high single-digit level through the end of the year. Only a modest
recovery in the fourth quarter is assumed. And we have tried to incorporate some impacts from some of the
programs that have been in place from the government, but it's difficult to fully estimate what those are at this
point in time.
As far as the increase that we experienced this quarter, we've really gone from an outlook that would have shown
GDP growth in the 1% to 2% range and unemployment levels in the 3% to 4% range to where you're seeing both
of those have a significant or severe reduction as far as our economic outlook. And so don't know how to predict
whether to see that type of a return again or not, but I would say that we'll have to continue to assess that
throughout the quarter, and as we wrap up the June results, we'll be in a position to better assess that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, perfect. Thank you. And maybe just final question. Maybe a little more visibility into what's actually
happening with the line of credit draws that you're seeing. I'm assuming they've been largely redeposited but you
guys I think have really unique seasonality in your deposit flows anyway. So the first quarter I think tends to be
kind of weaker for you guys, so it makes it I guess a little less obvious from the outside what's going on. So
maybe just any additional color there, please?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, Scott. You're absolutely right. If you look at the average balances especially on the deposit side, you see a
downward trend from fourth quarter to first quarter. That really was driven by significant temporary deposits that
were in place throughout the fourth quarter. We knew they would go out in early first quarter, and they did. As I
mentioned on the call, we've seen deposit flows match the loan growth from end of February to now. We've seen
over $8 billion of inflow over that same time period and about $8 billion of loan growth. We saw about $6 billion of
line draws and about $1 billion of liquidity facilities that were used to replace commercial paper borrowings for our
customers, and on the line draws we're seeing a good percentage of those re-invested or re-deposited back into
our bank for deposit flows. And so that's part of the reason why we're seeing the strong deposit growth in the
month of March and early April.

I wanted to start on slide 14 where you guys are calling out the select commercial portfolios. Based on the weekly
monitoring you're now doing, can you give us a sense as to the magnitude of cash flow disruption that you're
seeing in these segments? And maybe if you know how many are participating in government programs would be
helpful too.

Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. As far as those industries, but I'll ask Mark to comment a little bit later as far as cash flows, but I would say
generally for the areas that we are monitoring, we have seen cash flows continue to be a little bit higher than what

we might have expected for certain areas including commercial real estate and other activities. As far as the
assistance, as I mentioned before, just through the PPP program we had 38,000 customers request those loans
and we're well on our way as far as getting those through approval of the SBA and onto funding, and so we have
over 90% of those applications already through that approval stage. As far as additional insights on cash flows,
Mark, anything else you would add on those higher risk areas?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark W. Midkiff A
Chief Risk Officer, KeyCorp
I think you noted or Chris noted that we've had approximately 800 customers that have come to us asking for
some level of deferral in the commercial categories, and so I would – I'd make that comment. That's been inside
of a couple billion dollars.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, KeyCorp
Steve, the only thing I would – this is Chris. The only thing I would add, obviously most impacted would be things
like consumer behavior, restaurants, sports, entertainment, leisure, travel obviously very significantly impacted.
And on the other side of the equation, leveraged lending, we always talk – any time we talk about portfolios we
always talk about any place there's leverage. That portfolio wouldn't necessarily have seen the kind of impact
from cash flows that some of the others had.
Q – [05V30N-E Steve Alexopoulos]>: Right. Thank you. And given the large reserve increase this quarter, can
you give us a sense of what the reserves are on these buckets that you're calling out in the slide, the specific
reserves?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
We haven't shown the reserves on those categories. We'll see if we can add that in future disclosures. In our slide
deck we do show the reserves by loan category, and so I think that's helpful just to get some insight as to how
that reserve compares to the current levels of charge-offs. And it's also a good benchmark to show compared to
other peers because we think that by loan category they're fairly consistent with what we've seen so far for some
of the larger banks that have announced already.

Steven Alexopoulos Q

Okay. And finally for Beth, you spent the last several years changing many aspects of KeyCorp, right? Top to

our risk profile as well as our liquidity and being good stewards of our capital. And we did it to position ourselves

for stronger financial performance and then, importantly, to prove that this company would indeed weather a
downturn both as a company that could absorb its credit portfolio marks and risks and indeed be a top performer
and perform better than the median, and to also make sure that we couldn't extend capital and support our
customers through this downturn – whatever downturn it was, and apparently here we are. And as you can tell, in
the face of this we indeed are extending that support both through the PPP program as well as line draws, and I'm
highly confident with the team, with the positioning of this balance sheet, with our risk profile and what will be our
future performance.

Great. Thanks. I guess maybe starting off with loan growth. Obviously, Don, on an end of period basis it's really,
really strong. I'm sure you've had conversations with some of your larger borrowers. How do you envision those
balances trending over the next couple quarters? I mean, is this just a temporary drawdown? Is this something a
little more permanent? Thanks.

Christopher M. Gorman A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, KeyCorp
Ken, it's Chris. We, as you can imagine, through this time period have been talking to a whole bunch of our
customers. As it relates to these larger investment grade companies that you're referring to, first, we're getting
obviously a significant amount of deposits. But as the markets continue to stabilize, and they clearly have by a
whole lot of metrics, I look for a lot of that to be taken out probably in the bond market probably in the next couple
quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. And then I guess maybe just in terms of – second question in terms of the drawdowns. How many of
those borrowers – I know you said 80% is – are investment grade. But how many of those borrowers have, like,
clearly defined borrowing bases or collateral that they're borrowing against versus we hear some of the very large
drawdowns? They may not have, like, specific collateral agreements like you would on sort of your middle market
customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, KeyCorp
So by definition, the biggest drawdowns are large investment grade companies that have access to capital. Ken,
people that are on a borrowing base would be constrained obviously by their ability to generate receivables and
inventory to, in fact, generate additional availability.

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, that makes sense. And then just last question. How are you guys reserving for troubled loans or so to
speak trouble loans where you are providing forbearance but they just aren't being classified for or as troubled? I
mean, is that something you can build into your CECL reserves today or is that something that we see
development materializing over the next couple quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Our CECL reserves do anticipate that kind of migration given the economic outlook we have. And on the
commercial side, even though we will be giving forbearance we would still be evaluating those credits as far as
having those appropriately risk-rated, and that risk rating will be reflected in the future CECL reserves that are
established for those credits and anticipated with this adjustment as well. On the consumer side, it's going to be a
little bit more challenging for as many of those might be even more based on delinquency status given some of
the forbearance that are done more on a bridge capacity. It might be a little bit lagged as far as the impact on
those credits.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Just wanted to ask a question about how we should look at your last DFAST results as a potential guide in terms
of the severity of losses this cycle. So a two-part question. One is that over nine quarters, in your last DFAST you
submitted in your company-run test something – an over 6% nine-quarter credit loss rate in C&I. And I'm

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
wondering what you see that's different in both positive and negative in terms of what could be playing out in this
actual recession versus the scenario in that last test. And also, you closed Laurel Road after your last DFAST,
and I'm wondering where do you see stress losses here, and is it as simple as taking that reserve from slide 23
and putting it over to consumer direct balances and saying okay, according to this reserve KeyCorp is implying a
3% loss rate as of balance sheet date on this portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
So a full question, Erika. I'll try my best to follow-up on that. But one, I would just offer up that as far as our
severely adverse scenario that we just submitted to the Fed just this quarter as a matter of fact, it would have an
economic scenario that will be much more dire than what occurred during the 2008 through 2010 time period, and
in that scenario we would've had about $4 billion of credit losses during that nine-quarter time period. If you take a
look at our total reserves that we have, both the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded loan
commitments, that totaled about $1.5 billion and so this is about 40% of those combined losses that are
recognized in that.
The biggest difference there is the duration of that stressed period, that it would have assumed severely adverse
impact on GDP and unemployment but they would've been sustained for a very long time period. Our current
assumptions that we have is that we start to see that recovery in the fourth quarter of this year, and so it's a much
shorter impact. And that duration is much more important as far as losses and especially on the consumer side as
opposed to just a V-shaped type of recovery some of the initial assumptions might have included. So I would say
that's the biggest gap as far as the difference between that severely adverse scenario and what we're showing as
far as reserves as of March 31.
And as far as Laurel Road, that's only a component of the overall direct consumer loan portfolio. And I would say
that the loss content that we're seeing from that, the performance of that portfolio continues to be very strong and
we're very pleased with it. Highly focused on doctors and dentists and that's the group right now that we want to
be able to support and bridge them through this time period, and the Laurel Road customer base and programs
we offer are very helpful to be able to accomplish that. So not seeing any outsized and expected stress loss for
that portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. Very helpful. And my second question is given the magnitude of interest rate reduction late in the first
quarter, could you perhaps help quantify the level of net interest margin compression that you expect for second
quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
For second quarter, there's going to be really three components that drive that interest rate margin compression.
Keep in mind that we do expect net interest income to be up, but the PPP program should have about a 7 basis
point, plus or minus, negative impact on margin, that the loans have a contractual rate of 1%. But by the time you
would factor in the loan fees associated with that, it's something just a little north of 2% which is still a low-yielding
loan for us in this environment.
Second would be the increased liquidity levels, that we're currently maintaining north of $3 billion in cash each
night and at the Fed just to make sure that we have robust levels of liquidity given potential changes in overall
14

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
funding mixes and what have you. And that's probably up from $0.5 billion to $1 billion, and so that increased
liquidity will put pressure on NIM, not on NII but have pressure on NIM. And then I would say that the remaining
pressure on net interest margin would probably be in that low to mid type of basis point range difference because
the rate decline occurred late in the quarter. And while we said that our deposit rates will be down 30 to 35 basis
points, that still would not translate to north of a 40% beta on that change. And so that's something that will put
some near-term pressure on margin as we see the lag impact of deposit pricing coming through.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And if I could just please sneak in one more. There's clearly a significant amount of demand for bank
balance sheet. And I'm wondering with your common equity Tier 1 ratio at 8.95% what is the level that you're
comfortable drawing this ratio down to as this demand for balance sheet continues, and is there anything you can
do in terms of RWA mitigation to offset some of the demand from your customers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. As far as our outlook, right now we would say, and Chris highlighted this as well, that the commercial loan
growth should be muted this quarter compared to what we experienced in the first quarter, and we're not seeing
the active increased request for draws or other funding coming through from those customers. Second, we are
seeing strong loan growth but a lot of that coming from the PPP program which has a zero risk-weighted
component to the extent that it is fully guaranteed and will be fairly short-term in nature, and so that shouldn't put
any pressure on that. And then the consumer loan growth that we're seeing, about half of it is coming from
residential mortgage which is also a low risk-weighted asset and then the other half from Laurel Road.
And so we don't think we'll see as much pressure on the RWA as what we did this last quarter, but the growth we
saw at the period end cost us over 40 basis points of RWA because of that rapid increase in some of those
balances so we don't see that as an impact for us going forward.
I would say that as far as what level are we comfortable at, we'll continue to monitor it. But what I had said is that
that's slightly below our longer-term targeted range but that was with the expectation that when things are a little
more stressed we could see that drop a little bit below that level. And so we do believe that we have sufficient
capital to continue to play through and support our customers and support our current dividend outlook based on
our current earnings projections as well. So we think that we're in good position there but that's something we'll
continue to evaluate as things would evolve.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Back to the reserve, I appreciate the color you gave in terms of how you're thinking about the through-cycle loss
content, that your reserve is at approximately 40% of that new level that you calculated of the through-cycle
losses. I know other banks this earnings season have also talked about that relative size, about 40% ballpark, but
they've also been indicating that they expect potential incremental loan loss reserve additions of size in coming
quarters. Can you just talk about the likelihood of taking additional sizable increases in the next couple quarters
because when you look at it, you would think that you might need to be higher than 40% of that expected loss rate
in this type of crisis? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Great question. And I wish someone could help provide some clarity on the depth of the recession, the duration of
that recession and what kind of impact all these programs are having, but we couldn't be more pleased with what
we're seeing from the Treasury and from the Fed and from others to help provide that bridge support for our
customers, and we think that will have a meaningful impact on their ability to continue to operate going forward
and bring that economy back up to the level it needs to be. But we don't know what's going to happen between
now and June 30. But as far as other comments, if you look at the economic forecasts that have come out in early
April, they probably are a little bit more negative, more about the recovery rate as opposed to the depth of the
actual recession and so more going toward a U-shaped scenario as opposed to a V-shape, and so we'll have to
continue to assess that.
I think it will be too premature for us to speculate as to how much that reserve change could be at this point in
time. But if we do see more negative economic forecast as of the end of the second quarter there could be
additional pressure on reserves at that point in time, but it's just too early to tell, John. Sorry about that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
No, it's okay, Don. All right, thanks. And then I know you've cited the balance of the PPP loans and that you're
seeing a healthy amount of appetite there, and it looks like we might get an upsizing of the program so I got to
assume that you're going to see greater demand over time for that. What are your plans for those loans on the
balance sheet? Are you looking to sell them and is it going to be the secondary market? Is it going to be the Fed,
to their facility? How should we expect that that finds its way on and off your balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Well, one, we're very excited about that program. And we were out early and I think, Chris, we had over 130,000
outreach efforts to customers and had over 50,000 customers at least express some interest in understanding

what the program is and, as we mentioned, over 38,000 applications. And so that's a huge percentage of our
customer base and very pleased we've been able to support those the way that we have. And as we looked at
that program, we think that the life of those loans should be fairly short, that if you think about, say, 10 weeks from
the time that they get those loans they would be in a position potentially to ask for forgiveness against that.
And so we think that the life could be fairly short-term in nature, and so we will keep it on our balance sheet. But
as I mentioned before, we're having very strong deposit flows. The Fed and Treasury have provided additional
areas as far as support or funding for those assets. And if deposits aren't sufficient to meet those funding needs
then we would have those available to us to provide that liquidity. But generally, I don't see any need to sell those
assets as part of our operational plan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, KeyCorp
Yeah. If I could just add, we are immensely proud of how our team rallied around the PPP program which we
think is so important to get this country back up and moving. If you think about it, Don mentioned the 135,000
client outreaches. We had more than 10,000 of our teammates out working on this massive program, very short
timeframe, and I'm just really proud of how the whole team came together and really went out to support these
clients. We also built some really great digital straight-through processing that enabled us to basically process 9
or 10 years' worth of SBA loans over a couple weeks.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
I'm just wondering you guys do sit on a fair amount of excess liquidity, and I was wondering where is the LCR
ratio today because I thought – is the thought to continue to use the securities portfolio to fund loan growth
because it seems like there is a fair amount of room to remix earning assets to help the margin somewhat maybe
in the second half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Peter, you've been reading our playbook here that we didn't buy any new securities here in the first quarter. We're
using some of the cash flows there to re-invest in loan growth and so we still think that's clearly available to us.
We have well over $50 billion of liquidity that our LCR ratio that we would calculate now is north of 120%, so it's
well above what we would target. The Fed, for a bank our size, would have us in the 100% range and we're well
north of that even in this environment. So we will consider to evaluate how we want to manage the overall mix of
the assets and that could be a continued opportunity for us especially given the re-investment rate for those
investment securities is well south of what our current portfolio is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
What are those re-investment rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. We tend to have fairly short-durated agency CMOs and our current cash flow off of that is somewhere north
of $240 million as far as maturing securities. The re-investment yield today would be between 1.25% and 1.5% so
down considerably from where it was just a quarter ago.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then just a follow-up question. Chris, with your opening remarks about going into this downturn in a
much better position certainly from a capital liquidity standpoint, but could you just talk about some of the biggest
changes from a credit perspective heading into this downturn versus the financial crisis and then just comments
that you think you could do better than peers from a credit perspective?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, KeyCorp
Sure, Peter. So if you went back 10 years for example, I'll just give you a couple things. Take a look at, say, our
real estate business. At that point our real estate business, we would've had about a third of our real estate book
would've been in construction loans. Today, that number would be 8%-ish. We also – our real estate business at
that point which is where most of our losses were incurred was principally a book-and-hold kind of business, and
in the last decade we have built an amazing ability to distribute paper such that we don't really necessarily take
any risk that we don't want to take because we have a lot of avenues, whether it's Fannie, Freddie, FHA, the life
companies. Right now the CMBS market is not available but it will be once again.
It's interesting, Peter. Even in these times, because we've done a good job, and I'll stay on real estate because
that is where most of our losses were, we also reconfigured exactly who we want to do business with. If you think
about people in the multi-family business, in every city there's one or two groups that really are the premier
providers of multi-family and we reconfigured our complete client base. And what we're seeing right now is, in
spite of the disruption out there, that our backlog is actually growing in our commercial mortgage business

because we have picked the people that some of the agencies want to bank. So that would be just some
examples of what we've done.
The other thing that I'm really proud of, we are a significantly bigger business today than we were a decade ago.
And I mentioned leverage earlier; we always focus wherever there's leverage is where there's risk. And our
leverage book is generally exactly where it was 10 years ago before we grew by 40%. So those are just a couple
examples. It's the whole concept of being able to distribute paper, being able to carefully pick your clients, this
whole notion of targeted scale and then lastly, in the case of real estate, it's just a completely different business.

Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
One more thing I would add to that as well is that under Chris and Beth they both shifted the overall strategy of
the company to be relationship bank. And having that complete relationship, we have shown time and time again
through as many downturns those relationship customers will perform much better than where it's a lending-only
relationship or where you're not the primary bank. And I would say that that subtle difference, we think, should
better position us this time than what we experienced in the last downturn. Thanks, Peter.

Hi
[Technical Difficulty] (00:49:03-00:49:15)
Sorry about that. I had a follow-up question on the PPP program. Could you just talk about the average loan size
because it does impact the process fee? And Don, in response to an earlier question, you kind of added that fee
into the yield. So I just want to make sure where that's going to run through the income statement in the second
quarter, whether it's included in interest income like you maybe suggested or if it will come through fee income?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
Sure. As we mentioned before, we've got about 38,000 applications, about $9 billion as far as the loan value there
so something north of the $200,000 per average loan size. And so it's been a broad mix of customers that's going
from our small business banking accounts to business banking to even some of our middle market customers still
falling under that 500 head count level, so it's been a huge program for us and very pleased with those results. As
far as the fees that we will be realizing on those, we do expect to take those through the net interest margin and
amortize it through the contractual life of those loans which is two years. And so as those will be forgiven or pre-
paid the unamortized portion of that fee will be taken in income at that time as well.

Christopher M. Gorman A

So Terry, it's Chris. I'm proud of the fact that we at Key, along with many others in the industry, have been part
and parcel working with the Fed and others to structure the Main Street program. We have a whole team around it
and we think it's going to be helpful to some of our clients that really need some incremental funding for the Main
Street program they wouldn't necessarily have access to additional capital. We think it's going to be very helpful. It
hasn't gotten a lot of discussion, but if you look at Main Street and some of the other programs, in the aggregate
they're about $600 billion so it's not inconsequential. We're working hard on it as we speak.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Instinet LLC
Thank you. Good morning. Don, I wanted to follow-up on John's question regarding your CECL assumptions.
Your comments make it very clear that there's lots of uncertainty. But without getting into magnitude, just
direction, we've heard other banks that have already reported this quarter talk about the incremental degradation
in the outlook post-3/31 with unemployment rising and GDP declining even more sharply than originally expected
and some going from expecting a V-shape recovery as recently as March to now anticipating more of a U-shape
recovery. And so given those changes, the suggestion there has been that they'll need to book incremental
reserves in Q2. So I guess the direct question for you guys is are the increases in initial claims that have
negatively surprised many over the last two Thursdays in April, are those increases contemplated in your
allowance or would you need to book additional reserves if those elevated unemployment figures hold?

As far as the unemployment and GDP assumptions, again, we really have to wait until we get closer to the end of
the quarter to make any assessments there. I would say, as you've highlighted, that the near-term impacts have
been negative adjustments to the outlook since April 1. But as far as I'm aware, I haven't seen any new Moody's
scenarios and others that we hadn't used or considered in connection with our initial assessment. But I think we're
just – again, I apologize, but we're just way too early to try to predict what's going to happen as of June 30.
As far as the economic outlook, we're hitting a period here which I think will be very informative as we start to see
how states and counties within states start to return to work and how quickly the economy starts to recover from
that, how do these programs that have been implemented help bridge those customers through this environment,
and this is really at a historic level as far as that support. And so I wish I could give you a more direct answer but I
think we need to see some of this play out before we provide any more insights as to where it might go from here.

former regulators have suggested that it would be prudent for the banks to cut back on their dividends to the
extent that the duration of the downturn is prolonged. Can you frame for us what it would take for Key to halt its
dividend?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
We'll continue to assess that based on what we see for the depth and duration of the downturn. In our severely
adverse scenario that I mentioned before, that takes our common equity Tier 1 ratio to roughly 8% and that's with
the assumption that we continue our dividend at the current level. And that current dividend is only $185 million a
quarter – $180 million a quarter as far as the capital utilization. And so it's not a high percentage as far as the
overall earnings capacity of the organization. It's also something that's very important to our shareholders and
especially our retail shareholders, so we'll take that all into consideration. We believe that we're well-positioned to
continue to maintain that based on our current outlook and assessments. And so we don't see that as coming to
at-risk but we'll continue to re-evaluate as we get through this quarter and beyond to see – where we would see
the economy trending at that point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Instinet LLC
Understood. So to the extent that this were to be a prolonged downturn, do you think is the decision over whether
or not to suspend the dividend, one that you think banks should have the freedom to make on their own? Or
would you prefer that regulators more broadly urge banks to suspend the dividend so the entire industry is sort of
in the same boat rather than having one-off cases across individual banks? Just curious what your views are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
I think if you talk to most banks, we have all significantly increased our capital levels and our liquidity position
since the last crisis. And part of the reason for doing that was to be able to continue to support our customers in
times of need, and we think that we're well-positioned to do that, but also, where appropriate, to continue to
support our common dividend. Most, if not all banks, has cut out their share buybacks, and that's a significant
portion of the capital returns that have occurred over the last few years and so that portion has already been
stopped.

And so as we look forward, the regulators may come to a point where they are recommending that the large
banks do suspend dividend if they believe that things are too dire. But I think that most banks would believe that
we're well positioned to continue to support those based on what we're seeing in the economy today and based
on our capital levels that we maintain.

Operator: Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning. Don, wondering if you could just give us a little bit more detail on some of the fee
points that you made in the guidance. So first of all, when you talk about the non-market revenues, in your
prepared remarks you talked about a couple of extra negatives this quarter. So when you're thinking about slightly
lower off of first quarter, should we be adjusting for those little dings as well as much as obviously for the fair
value marks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. The fair value marks are more than little dings. And so credit spreads have already come in nicely since the
end of the quarter. And if we would snap the line as of yesterday as opposed to March 31st, that $73 million
reserve for customer derivatives would be down by $25 million already. And so we think that will provide some
additional support.
We would not expect that the ding that we mentioned as far as the operating lease adjustments. That was more of
a one-off type of an adjustment as opposed to something we would see going forward.
If you look at some of the other revenue categories, trust and investment services, about half of that is related to
asset values, and about half of it is brokerage and/or commercial activity, trading account activity within that.
And so those levels were a little elevated this quarter, which we would probably see come down a little bit. I would
say that cards and payments related revenues are impacted by credit card, purchase card, and merchant services
revenues. It's about 50% of that is tied to that category and we did see declines of 20% to 30% of those
transaction volume levels at the end of the first quarter. So, we would expect those kind of trends initially continue
into the second quarter.
But many of the other revenue categories could see some stability and/or even increase. The residential
mortgage fee income was negatively impacted by $9 million of MSR impairment.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
Our pipeline right now is sitting at $2 billion, which is 2 times what it was going into the first quarter. And so we
should see some nice ramp-up in those revenues. And so that's why we think that we would see some of the
other revenue categories down slightly, reflecting some of that activity level, but being offset by some of the
benefit for residential mortgage and other fee categories.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yes. Okay, great. And so then your markets related really presume – really speaks to the investment bank, I'm
understanding it's too early. Maybe can you just talk about your product areas? And just what's happening in
those product areas? You've got the CRE business on one side and then your verticals. Obviously, to your point
earlier about the fair value marks, the markets have improved. We've seen some opening in certain places. So
while early, just can you just maybe talk about the dynamics that the customers are talking through, that you're
hearing about with regards to whether pipelines move or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, KeyCorp
Sure. Ken, it's Chris. So pre-COVID-19, we had what we described as very good pipelines across the board.
What has impacted our business the most is the delay in M&A activities. Obviously, the whole world is in price
discovery right now, and it's not a time when you can complete an M&A transaction. That also has a knock-on
effect of our syndication business because we finance many of the transactions in which we advise. So those
deals, I don't think, are gone. But the question is, when do they come back? And that goes back to Don's point,
how deep and how long, which everyone is trying to figure out right now.
Now as you step back, some of our verticals that we've invested heavily in, I think, will be well positioned as we
go forward. If you think for example about health care, our Cain Brothers platform is probably the number one
adviser for facilities-based health care. I think you're going to see massive consolidation as we come out of this.
The next area where we've invested a lot of time and money has been technology. And I know I can speak for
Key, we have three times as – our growth rate of digital customers is three times the rate prior to COVID-19. And
so the whole notion of Software-as-a-Service, the whole notion of technology, I think, is going to be an area that
goes really well. Another area where we're focused is renewables, and I don't think that is going to have much of
an impact. I think if you look at the push for both wind and solar, and we're a leader in North America, I think those
will remain strong. So that gives you a little bit of a flavor maybe from both a product perspective and a vertical
perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. And then one just quick one on the expenses side. So, really good first quarter results and you're
talking about stable. Is part of that, again, the reflection of the uncertainty on the markets related revenues and
the slower start to the year? Or are there other things that you're also doing underneath what you had already
done last year to continue to hold the line there? Thanks, guys. And best of luck, Beth.

Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Thanks, Ken. And we are continuing to focus on other expense initiatives and programs to help move the
expense levels down. I would say that some of the outlook reflects not only some revenue outlook is provided, but
also some of the additional efforts, including what we would be seeing from a branch distribution perspective,
what we're seeing from a current operating expense levels for supporting our current team. And also includes
some increased costs that we're expecting because of the shutdown that we're paying additional incentives to
many of our team members that are required to be out in the application for their responsibilities, whether it's
branch employees or others. And we've also had to step up some costs associated with onshoring some activities
where we've seen some third-party vendors that haven't been able to provide the support that we need in certain
areas, and it's requiring us to add some additional resources there and so each of those are reflected in that
relatively stable expense outlook.

Hey, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
I was just thinking about some of your comments about the differences now versus the crisis for Key. I guess one
of the things during the crisis that was tough was the PPNR, your pre-provision earnings really kind of collapsed.
They got down to $80 million in 3Q 2009. And I guess this quarter even with all the charges, it was over $500
million. And Don, I guess, is it fair with all your comments even building in uncertainty for investment banking, it
seems like you're kind of pointing to a number of maybe $600 million, a little north of that. And then bigger picture
beyond the number, how do you think about the importance of that PPNR being so much higher just in terms of
your ability to chew through whatever the ultimate losses are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Great question. That's been a core focus of ours is continuing to maintain our positive operating leverage to
deliver improvements in that core performance to see a shift of our portfolio into more of a balanced approach.
And so that we have a higher percentage of retail-oriented businesses today than what we did before and those
are critical to us. I would agree that that increased level of PPNR is clearly important to us as far as supporting
our dividend going forward and our overall capital position. And so even in a stressed environment, we're still
showing strong levels of PPNR to be able to support the increased credit costs that might occur in those types of
environments and that's why we believe we are able to maintain those capital actions based on that type of an
outlook.

And then maybe one follow-up. As we think about the trajectory for capital going forward, can you remind us – so
all of AOCI is excluded from the CET1 ratio. And if that's right, how much flexibility would you see, whether it's the
hedges or securities gains, if you needed to access a little bit more CET1, what would be a reasonable ballpark
for the flexibility that the securities gains and hedges would give you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
The majority of the OCI is backed out for capital purposes. And so we are sitting in a net positive that would give
us a lot of flexibility to be able to manage that common equity Tier 1 ratio up by realizing some of those security
gains, if we wanted to. Our challenge for that would be that we don't want to do it for an earnings or liquidity
perspective. And oftentimes, you'll see a degradation in the future earnings when you would swap out the
securities for lower-yielding securities today, but it does provide us some flexibility there.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
So most of my questions have been asked, but I'll follow-up on a CECL-related question. Maybe this is for Don
and for Mark. And it's a little bit more of a broader question, but it's in response to Erika's question. And I guess I'd
like to get your perspective on this DFAST stress test and where they're useful as a gauge to look at CECL
reserve adequacy in downside case scenarios and where they're not? Because – and is there a risk of taking
those results too literally? And I ask that because beyond sort of the differences you highlighted, Don, in terms of
the economic assumptions, DFAST is sort of a fundamentally different exercise. It's meant to measure loss-
absorbing capital in a severe scenario. And hence the construction of DFAST is conservative, whether it's line
draw assumptions or until recently asset growth. It's a 9-quarter period.
And which is very different, obviously, from your corporate book, a lot of which is much, much shorter contract
maturities are reserving over. And CECL is a best guess estimate of a point in time estimate of what your
reserves and your losses will be. So it's sort of a fundamentally different construct. So I guess my question is

more how should we use that as sort of a gauge? And is there a risk of taking those results and the $4 billion you
mentioned too literally as sort of a gauge of where reserves could go to even in a really severe scenario?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Saul, I think you've answered the question better than I can. But I would agree with your observation that the
purpose for CCAR is, one, to stress the capital. And so the assumption sets that are included in that would
include higher utilization continuing for an extended period of time as far as some of the commercial loan draws
would include using some historic loss rates that may not be reflective of the current environment or the current
portfolio levels.
The Fed testing would include some adjustments for where the data isn't present for their models, which elevates
the loss content compared to what you might see. Another nuance is that for CECL, you only provide the reserve
for the loan through its maturity, whereas in CCAR you would assume those loans get rolled over and therefore
could be subjected to future loss based on the economic scenario. So, it's a challenge. And I would say that I'm
surprised as tightly as some of the estimates and numbers have come out from the banks that have announced
so far, as far as the ranges for the change in the CECL reserves. I thought they would be all over the board.
But if you think about the variability and the different types of economic outlooks, you could assume the impact in
the models, what kind of a reasonable and supportable period people are using and how do those revert back to
the norms, I would have expected even a wider variability than what we're seeing today as far as the earnings
announcements have come through. And so, I think it's helpful as far as a benchmark. But I don't think that it's
necessarily predictive as far as if we would see the economy get worse. That's the reserves that would be
required.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Right. Okay. No, that's helpful. I guess I was just – I just wanted a little bit of verification that the way I was
thinking about it is broadly applicable. I guess just a quick follow-up then on the slide with the risk portfolios. A
clarification, the leverage loan portfolio, how much overlap is there in that portfolio with some of the other
segments that are at risk that you highlighted there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
I would say there's very little overlap there that I would say that, generally, our leverage book, probably more is
commercial industrial in nature as opposed to the categories that are shown. Chris, would you have any other
insights there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, KeyCorp
Right. Our leverage book lines up very, very strongly with our verticals that we are deep in. And so there would
not be a lot of overlap.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And just on those risk buckets, like any – there's a big variance within those buckets like travel, for
example, hotels, tours, and then there's air and water. I guess, like, is there a more granular assessment,
26

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
whereas, how much hotels, for example, the riskier parts within those buckets? Is there a way to kind of gauge
that? Because these are fairly broad categorizations for some of these – for the consumer discretionary, and
travel gets you highlighted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
There are some broader categories, for example, hotels. I believe that number is between the $700 million and $1
billion level, so a fairly small portion of the overall portfolio. But we'll see if we can provide some additional clarity
or granularity around those buckets that many of our peers have been more granular as far as commenting on
where there are very specific areas of risk, and these are more broader subsets. And we have that so we can
provide it.

our real estate portfolios. Those are the two places where there are leverage. We've been monitoring those very,
very closely for a very long time. But those are the two areas when you think about financial and economic stress,
I always start with leverage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then some of us on this call have been around for a while. And we remember the U.S.
government getting involved in lending or getting involved with the banks, and then subsequently changing the
rules on the banks. You might recall a crisis with [indiscernible] (01:13:33) what happened after that fiasco. And of
course, we had TARP and how they changed the rules on how to get out of TARP. What safeguards are you guys
putting up in this new program, the PPP program, on the mainstream lending program where you're working with
the government, you're helping your customers, which is great. Everybody is working twice as hard to get this
done. But 1.5 years from now, we're going to see that there were some mistakes made by the industry. What
safeguards are you putting in place to prevent any kind of pushback that you get? I mean – not just you, but the
industry may get 1.5 years from now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, KeyCorp
Well, first of all, Gerard, it's a great question. And obviously, when a program is put together in a matter of weeks
that's $350 billion, we think, going to another $250 billion. There – it's not perfectly clean. And our posture was
that we need to be there to support our clients, and we need to be out there talking to them and helping them
through this period. So that was kind of our guiding principle.
Having said that, we also spent time on things like indemnification, reps and warranties from the customers. Don,
do you want to add to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
No. I think you're right, Chris, that we've been very careful before we even send the app in for approval from the
SBA that we have done our homework, and we've done appropriate underwriting based on the standards that are
put in place. And so it's been a significant effort on the team's part to ramp up to be able to address that. But
that's primarily our area of safeguard is making sure that we are following our understanding and our best
interpretation and the guidelines and rules that are out there.
So we, again, appreciate everything that's being done from the Treasury, from the Fed, from others that are trying
to help provide that bridge, and we want to support our customers through that the best way that we can. And so
we just want to do it right, but hopefully not subject ourselves to additional risk with hindsight after the dust settles.
