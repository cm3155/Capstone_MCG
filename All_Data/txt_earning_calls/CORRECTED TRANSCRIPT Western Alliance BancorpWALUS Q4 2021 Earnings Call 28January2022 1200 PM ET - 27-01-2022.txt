Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. 2021 was a watershed year for Western Alliance as we drove many of our own
records for balance sheet growth, total net revenue, and earnings while thoughtfully expanding into new business
lines and geographies that will make us an even stronger, more diversified bank.
For the year, total assets ended just shy of $56 billion, with loans growing 44% over the year to $39.1 billion and
deposits rising 49% to $47.6 billion The strong balance sheet momentum propelled record net revenues of $2
billion, net income of $899 million, and EPS of $8.67, which is our 12th consecutive year of rising earnings.
Turning to the fourth quarter results. WAL earned total net revenues of $561 million, net income of $246 million,
and EPS of $2.32. Strong balance sheet expansion continued with quarterly loan growth of $4.3 billion or 49% on
a linked quarter annualized basis, and deposits rose by $2.3 billion or 20% annualized. Loan demand continue to
broaden across our business lines, with C&I loans increasing by $1.8 billion, inclusive of $200 million of PPP
runoff, along with a $1.8 billion growth in our residential portfolio and $584 million in CRE.
One of the hallmarks of our national commercial business strategy is the ability to develop niche specialty banking
businesses and to attract qualified talent whilst we scale new business lines with superior risk adjusted returns.
As an example, since joining in June, our restaurant franchise financing has $151 million in outstanding and is a
positive contributor to earnings. Similarly, our Texas-based single-family home construction CRE team has $235
million in approved commitments. Our loan pipeline and channel checks continue to show a broadening of loan
growth in our traditional commercial loan businesses.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
Attracting seasoned senior teams to WAL provides the opportunity to establish new business lines that ramp up
quickly due to their existing client relationships. A $6.2 billion increase in average earning assets drove net
interest income growth of $40 million or 39% annualized to $450 million as excess liquidity deployment into loans
and loans held for sale contributed significantly to earnings.
Fee income was $110 million, representing 20% of total net revenue, a decline of $28 million from the prior
quarter, as mortgage banking-related income was impacted by seasonal fourth quarter weakness and the
mortgage sector's transition to a rising rate environment which compressed gain on sale margins. I would like to
reiterate that AmeriHome is fully integrated into the strategic fabric of Western Alliance and is thoughtfully
managed to maximize value for the entire bank through loan deposit and net interest income growth, not just gain
on sale margins.
The B2B corresponding business inside of Western Alliance has several business levers which can be
repositioned to sustain earnings throughout rate and economic cycles. Given the flexibility of AmeriHome's
business model, ongoing mortgage operations can provide multiple revenue opportunities, which serve to offset
lower gain on sale recognition.
Western Alliance has branch-like flexible business model, provides us a competitive advantage to leverage
operating efficiencies to enhance financial results while investing in business initiatives to drive future growth.
Quarterly adjusted noninterest expenses grew $4 million to $235 million, producing an efficiency ratio of 41.3%.
To put this in perspective, over the last five years, total loans and deposits have grown 2.5 times the rate of
operating expenses, excluding AmeriHome. Productivity improvements provide us with the capability to absorb
higher labor costs while continuing to fund product and technology investments.
Total adversely graded assets were flat and quarterly net loan charge-offs were just 2 basis points. Western
Alliance is one of the most profitable banks in the industry with a return on average assets and return on average
tangible common equity of 1.69% and 25.8%, respectively, which will continue to support capital accumulation
and strong capital levels.
Finally, what excites me most are the differentiated technology and banking services that Western Alliance is
increasingly delivering to our clients to solve unique pain points and facilitate transactions. We recently
announced a partnership with Tassat Group to deliver blockchain-based payments to our clients using their cash-
paying platform. The launch of this program scheduled for early second quarter will allow Western Alliance Bank
clients to transfer funds instantaneously to one another 24/7.
Additionally, yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Digital Disbursements, a leading digital payment platform
for the class action legal industry that integrates legal settlement claim process with a multiproduct payment
portal. This differentiated technology solution enhances the capabilities of Western Alliance settlement services
team and solidifies the bank as an industry leader in a $15 billion legal class action market.
Our national settlement services business developed in 2019 and launched in 2020 has been described on
previous earnings call as deposit initiative one. This business has successfully generated $2.3 billion in deposits
as of year-end, and we are thrilled to welcome the new team from Digital Disbursements to help the bank
continue to produce unique value-added solutions to the legal service sector.
Dale will now take you through our financial performance.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
Dale M. Gibbons
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thank you, Ken. For the quarter, Western alliance generated adjusted net income to common shareholders of
$242.5 million and earnings per share of $2.32. Pre-provision net revenue was $326 million. Total revenue grew
$12 million during the quarter to $561 million. And net interest income grew $40 million during the quarter to $450
million, an increase of 10%, primarily as a result of significant balance sheet growth and deployment of liquidity
into higher yielding assets.
Average interest earning assets increased $6.2 billion, while the lower yielding cash position [indiscernible]
(00:08:32) to 2.3% from 3.9% of interest earning assets. Although not indicated on this page, I want to address
the characterization of two items in noninterest income. Regarding the $8 million of securities gains we reported,
in the second quarter of 2020, we purchased over $100 million-ish of term municipal bonds that were in sectors
hard hit by the pandemic, most notably airports. In the fourth quarter, we sold those bonds as they had recovered
in value and the velocity of rate expectations changed. I know securities gains are often excluded from core
analysis, but this seems more like a trading game to us.
Regarding the $7 million in credit guarantee revenue, during the quarter, we sold a credit-linked note in which the
buyer of the note assumes the first loss position of the $4.5 billion residential portfolio. This $7 million in revenue
is the currently expected credit losses avoided by selling these bonds. I had CECL [indiscernible] (00:09:32)
before it was born. I don't think it's remotely helpful to investors in understanding bank financials, and it certainly
doesn't improve comparability. But I don't know anyone who is taking CECL based credit provisions and excluding
them from core, which is the same principle here. It doesn't make sense to us that if we increase residential loans
and book a day one cumulative loss expectation charge and the next day, we sell a credit-linked note to put that
exact same loss expectation to another party that we should be stuck with the debit and core income before
[indiscernible] (00:10:06) the insurance credit for determining earning power.
Overall noninterest income decreased $28 million to $110 million from the prior quarter driven primarily by
industry-wide gain on sale margin compression. As Ken noted, in anticipation of margin compression, we are
implementing several initiatives to bridge the gain on sale earnings slowdown with predictable and stable net
interest income revenue streams. Noninterest expense excluding merger and restructure recoveries and loss on
extinguishment of debt increased to minus 1.6% or $4 million, resulting in efficiency ratio of 41.3%.
For the year, Western Alliance recorded net income of $899 million or $8.67 per share, a 72% increase over EPS
for 2020. Net interest income grew $382 million during the year to $1.5 billion, an increase of 33% year-over-year,
mainly attributable to increased loan balances and PPP loan fees. Noninterest income increased $333 million to
$404 million in the prior year as AmeriHome transaction closed early in the second quarter and contributed
significantly to fee grab. Finally, noninterest expense increased $360 million or 73% year-over-year as 950
AmeriHome employees joined WAL in the second quarter.
Turning now to our net interest drivers. Investment yield increased 5 basis points from the prior quarter or 2.51%
while on a linked quarter basis, loan yields declined 25 basis points following the continued strong growth in low
to no-loss assets such as residential loans and capital call loans and modest yield compression across other loan
categories. We continue to optimize the deployment of excess liquidity into higher yielding assets and allocated
cash yielding 10 basis points of the fed to loans held for sale yielding 3.04%.
Funding costs were slightly lower from the prior quarter due to the redemption of a $175 million subordinated debt
with increased interest-bearing deposit cost of 20 basis points and total cost of funds at 0.25%. The spot rate for
5

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
total deposits which includes noninterest bearing was 11 basis points. We expect funding costs to bottom at these
levels as rate hikes are forthcoming.
Overall, net interest income grew $40 million to $450 million during the quarter or 43% year-over-year as average
interest earning assets increased $6.2 billion or 13% during the quarter. Liquidity deployment continued and cash
balances were optimized with cash as a portion of average earning assets of 2.3%, a decline from 3.9% the prior
quarter, resulting in a loan to deposit ratio of 82%, an improvement from 77% prior. The net interest margin
increased 10 basis points to 3.33%, mainly driven by lower yields on our Commercial real estate portfolio and
strong growth in low – low loss but lower yielding residential loans and capital call lines.
With regard to asset sensitivity, our rate risk profile has been reduced over the last two years as we've added
fixed rate residential mortgages and the yield on the majority of available rate, Commercial loans have bottomed
out at their contractual floors. We are poised to recognize significant increases in net interest income in the rising
rate environment once these floors are no longer inhibiting loan yield escalation and with ongoing balance sheet
growth. Consequently, this asset sensitivity is more muted initially, but accelerates as interest rates normalize.
Currently, $16 billion or 94% of our variable rate loans with floors are at their contractual floors. The 25-basis-
point rising rates, 25% of these loans will rise off the floors, and with 100-basis-point rising rates, 75%
cumulatively will return to variable rate.
In a rate shock scenario of plus 100 basis points on a static balance sheet, net interest income will rise $73 million
or 4.6%. Using a ramp scenario on a dynamic balance sheet, we expect net interest income to increase $62
million in the next 12 months after quarterly rate increases are initiated, and given the pandemic – the dynamics
of our loan floors, a $257 million increase over a two-year timeframe if only four rate hikes are accomplished
through 2023.
In the rising rate environment, other areas of Western Alliance's income statement may also be influenced.
Mortgage sector volumes and profitability are expected to be reduced with lower refinance volumes, partially
offset by increased servicing revenue as the life of mortgage servicing rates are extended. These factors may be
partially mitigated as we expect deposit betas and earnings credits on $10.8 billion of deposits to be lower than in
the previous rising rate periods and to have longer lag times, but could give back collectively about half of the
potential net interest income improvement for our interest rate sensitivity.
AmeriHome is now fully integrated into WAL, and gain on sale volume and margin contraction can be minimized
by accelerating loan, deposit, EBO, and product channel diversification, none of which are available to standalone
mortgage operators but are available within a bank-owned company. We expect the net interest income sourced
through AmeriHome relationships to rise throughout the year, countering reductions in traditional mortgage
banking income and growing total revenue in net.
Our efficiency ratio improved modestly to 41.3% from 41.5% in Q3 as our net revenue growth exceeded that of
our expense growth. One of the key characteristics of our national business line approaches is high operating
leverage. As mentioned in our prior calls, we expect the efficiency ratio to remain in the lower 40s for the year,
inclusive of planned technology investments, new product development expenses, and the absorption of higher
compensation costs supporting rising rate and deposit account relationships.
Pre-provision net revenue increased $9 million or 2.8% from the prior quarter and 58% from the same period last
year. This resulted in PPNR ROA of 2.24% for the quarter, a decrease of 21 basis points compared to 2.45%,
primarily driven by balance sheet growth outpacing PPNR increases. This continued strong performance in

leading capital generation provides us with significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth, manage
capital actions, and meet credit demands.
Robust balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans held for investment increased $4.3 billion
or 12% to $39 billion and deposit growth of $2.3 billion brought balances to $47.6 billion at year-end. On a
quarterly average basis, loans held for investment grew 16% and deposits grew 8%. In all, total assets grew 53%
year-over-year.
Total borrowings increased $330 million over the prior quarter to $2.4 billion, primarily due to increase in overnight
borrowings of $275 million and the issuance of $228 million in credit-linked notes, partially offset by the
redemption of $175 million in sub-debt. Finally, TBV per share increased $3.17 over the prior quarter to $37.84
and is up 22% year-over-year.
We continue to generate consistent organic loan growth from our flexible national business banking strategy and
are seeing broad-based demand. Loans held for investment grew $4.3 billion in the quarter. Quarterly loan growth
was split almost evenly by an increase in residential real estate loans of $1.8 million, which now comprised 24%
of loans and $1.8 billion also in C&I loans as demand for capital call lines and mortgage warehouse lines
remained strong. And we saw an acceleration of demand for broader business lending nationwide.
Including early success in our new restaurant franchise finance team, CRE loans grew $534 million,
predominantly as a result of demand in our hotel franchise finance that bounced back as we expanded
relationships with proven clients and sponsors while also obtaining tighter underwriting. Additionally, construction
and land loans added $79 million.
Turning to deposits, we continue to see broad-based core deposit growth across our business channels. Deposits
grew $2.3 billion or 20% annualized in the fourth quarter, driven by increases in interest-bearing DDA of $2 billion.
Non-interest-bearing DDA of $295 million and CDs of $226 million, partially offset by a reduction in savings and
money market funds of $162 million. Robust fundraising activity in tech and innovation, coupled with market share
expansion of HOA banking relationships, contributed significantly to quarterly deposit growth. We also saw a
strong performance from regional commercial funds.
To highlight one of our growing national deposit businesses, business escrow services previously called deposit
initiative 2 provides escrow payments and administrative services for M&A transactions. This initiative launched in
2021 with a new senior leader and has recruited a highly effective team and has established offices in New York
City and Minneapolis. The team has formed strong relationships with serial acquirers and successfully facilitated
over 100 acquisitions, which quadrupled our deposit balances in the fourth quarter in this business line to $600
million. We now have established ourselves as a formidable market competitor in the space.
Our asset quality remained stable after the significant improvement seen in the prior quarter. Total classified
assets rose $36 million in Q4 to $301 million or 54 basis points of total assets. Special mention loans declined
$33 million during the quarter to 0.85% of funded loans, greater than 30% reduction from the prior level since in
September 2020. Total classified assets in special mention loans as a percentage of total assets and funded
loans are now lower than in 2019.
Quarterly credit – net credit losses were $1.4 million or 2 basis points of average loans compared to $3 million in
Q3. Our total loan ACL increased $11 million from the prior quarter to $290 million due to significant loan growth
in low loss segments. In all, total loan ACL to funded loans declined 6 basis points to 74 basis points.

Adjusting for the $1.8 billion of mortgage warehouse lines and the $4.6 billion of residential loans covered by the
credit-linked notes were ample with first-loss coverage as assumed by a third party. The ACL ratio is 89 basis
points. Finally, given our industry-leading return on equity and assets, we continue to generate significant capital
to fund organic growth and maintain healthy regulatory capital ratios.
Our tangible common equity to total assets of 7.3% and common equity Tier 1 of 9.1% were both bolstered by net
income and the common stock offering under the ATM but were impacted this quarter by higher asset growth.
Inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.35, our TBV per share increased $3.17 to $37.84.
I'll now hand the call back over to Ken to conclude with closing comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Dale. 2021 really was an exceptional year from an earnings and loan growth perspective as our
distinctive national business strategy model continues to hit on all cylinders and our new initiatives are already
paying for themselves. We're very excited about the diverse set of growth opportunities in front of us as we enter
2022.
Looking forward for the full-year 2022, we expect loans held for investment to grow in excess of $2 billion per
quarter from prior guidance of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, or a low-to-mid 20% growth rate for the year with flexible
origination mix designed to maximize net interest income. Residential loan purchases will remain strong, but the
relative contribution to growth will be driven by liquidity, so as not to crowd out core commercial lending
opportunities. Deposits will grow in line with loans as we continue normalizing the loan-to-deposit ratio, which
today stands at 82%.
The efficiency ratio for the year will remain in the lower 40% range as we continue to invest in risk management
and technology, as well as build our teams to respond to growth opportunities we see in front of us. We believe
that net interest margin declines have abated and expect net interest margin to rise in concert with the FOMC
actions. Stable and rising NIM, coupled with strong balance sheet growth, will drive net interest income higher.
Regarding capital, our strong organic capital generation continues to support balance sheet growth. However,
quarter-to-quarter variability around this growth may require incremental capital actions to maintain a baseline
CET1 of 9%, including sales of credit-linked notes and common stock issuances from time to time. To facilitate
this, we expect to add 2 million shares to our ATM capacity.
In conclusion, we continue to see strong pipeline and have the operating flexibility to both execute on near-term
opportunities while investing for long-term growth. We believe the current full-year consensus guide is the floor for
2022, but should tilt more to quarters three and four to reflect the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business
lines and AMH's reposition.
Finally, one last note regarding Robert Sarver, our Executive Chairman. Our Independent Directors are actively
engaged in monitoring the allegations being investigated by the NBA. The Independent Directors have hired an
independent outside law firm, Munger, Tolles & Olson, to advise the Independent Directors on this matter and
assist them in conducting an investigation to evaluate Robert's continued leadership role at the company.
The investigation is being directed and overseen by the Independent Directors. And to be clear, it is not the result
of any allegations related to the company discovered by the board or the NBA. In addition, Western Alliance has
and will continue to assist the NBA in its ongoing investigation as requested.

At this time, Dale and Tim Bruckner, who is in the room, our Chief Credit Officer, and I are happy to take your
questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Casey Haire with
Jefferies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. Question on the balance sheet growth guide, specifically the deposits. I
mean, the – I think we all appreciate that the loan generation is pretty strong, and you guys are capable of doing
more than that $2 billion. And to the extent that you guys do, it sounds like you want to keep the loan-to-deposit
ratio on the low-80s. Can you match that loan growth on the deposit side, which will obviously be a little bit harder
in a rising rate environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
The answer is yes, okay? That's why we made the loan and deposits just dollars growing the same amount. But
our pipelines look very strong, and I just want to reinforce the $2 billion loan guidance floor and the $2 billion
deposit guidance floor are really at the low end as before. Our pipelines are very strong, and our deposit pipelines
are looking at the moment for the first quarter closer to double the floor amount. So we think we're off to a very
good start. We think deposits will be strong throughout the year, and we're very excited about what we're seeing
in the marketplace.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Casey, regarding your comment about keeping our loan-to-deposit ratio in the in the low-80s. So we look at held
for sale loans as not really an alternative to the loan growth. That's an alternative to cash for us. It's just a much
better yielding one. And for the most part, they're already – they have a great risk-adjusted capital ratio on them
because of – you're putting those loans to a GSE. And so instead of keeping money at the Fed or some other [ph]
due (00:27:42) from bank, putting it into these short-term basically puts that we have to the GSEs on these
mortgages is a much better deal. But that's where the substitution is. So I would look for our loan-to-deposit ratio
to continue to climb through the 80s, get back into more like the lower 90s.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. And just I always keep reminding people that held for sale, we're generating 3% yield on that or what is
basically a three-week money market asset guaranteed by the government. So we like that strategy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Very good. And I understood. On the deposit growth pipelines, how much of it do you expect from this –
from the recently announced Tassat partnership? I'm just trying to get a gauge on – obviously, we've seen that at

other banks be very explosive deposit generator. What kind of forecast are you guys baking in looking ahead in
2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Fair question. Right now, we haven't baked in anything. So when we discussed where I just said that the floor is
$2 billion, but I think we'll be more likely to double that for Q1. Much of that incremental growth is coming from our
efforts at AmeriHome to drive a higher deposit growth into the company.
So both the digital disbursements announcement today and the blockchain announcement connected to Tassat,
we have not put any numbers, any deposit numbers into our forecast this year. We are very hopeful and we
expect for those programs to generate greater deposits. But at this time, our first goal is let's get that blockchain
program with Tassat launched in early second quarter. And once we see the reception, we can then determine
how to give you some guide on the future deposit growth. But I should say both of those programs, the national
business line strategy settlement services and also business escrow services, they both report to Dale.
So, do you want to add anything to that, Dale?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No. No. That's absolutely correct. I mean, I would I would tell you, we have high hopes for what can be executed
here. And we've already started conversations with [ph] the third-party (00:30:01), but nothing is baked into what
we're talking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Very good. And just last one for me on the gain on sale line. Can you just give us some updated thoughts
on where we can see the gain on sale margin trend from that 28 bps here in the fourth quarter? And can you – in
the production volumes, obviously, can you run gain on sale pressure with stronger volumes? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So one of the things that we're doing, what we call either repositioning or pivoting AmeriHome, is to buy and sell
non-QM and jumbo loans. We started this immediately when we bought the company, we set up the program. We
have 850 clients at AmeriHome. We had to go out, educate, train, and then approve them to make non-QM and
jumbo loans.
Today, 250 clients are approved and they're generating about $200 million a month in mortgage loans. I tell you
all this because as we go through the year, we're going to be leaving the conventional market, which is seeing
more compression spread and to the extent that Western Alliance or the Commercial side of our balance sheet
doesn't want any of those mortgages or it doesn't hit our risk-adjusted returns, we will then sell them off in the
marketplace. And we think those margin spreads there are much higher, somewhere 35 to 40 basis points today.
So that was a long winded answer to say, as we reshift the focus inside of AmeriHome, the lower margin spreads
today will grow throughout the year. And that's why just bringing something back to my comments at the end,
that's why I said, hey, when you think about our earnings for 2022, I said, let's tilt them a little bit more to the back
end as we roll out all those non-QM and jumbo programs to our 850-member client base.

Okay. So the $200 million is – that's what you did in the fourth quarter, how big can that number grow to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. You know what, that's a very sizable number and I'll just say it could be very sizable and let us get through
another quarter and start building on it. And then the numbers we give you will have, one, a lot – we'll have a lot
more confidence in and it'll give us more credibility. But we see that number building all throughout the year, and
especially into 2023. We're very optimistic about this.

Hey, Brock.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Hey. Good morning. I think the – we should go back to the rate sensitivity. I think the most unsettling and
maybe complex slide was slide 8 and that last bullet. And Dale, maybe if you could just go through that again in
terms of – I think everyone gets the basic rate sensitivity. It's the offset that you may have because of the
mortgage businesses that I think are throwing investors.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Appreciate that, Brock. I mean, that's correct. I mean, we obviously saw a cyclical and seasonal pressure in
Q4 in the mortgage space and in anticipation of kind of the rate increases. If this rate trajectory were to continue,
we think that on that baseline giving to what Ken referred to in terms of the present business mix will undertake –
undergo additional pressure as rates rise 100 or 200 basis points, which crimps the non-interest revenue relative
to that operation.
Also noted there is that we're – we have certain deposits with earnings credit rates. I think that's going to be much
less significant than the – potentially the mortgage element. So – but what this doesn't include is what's Ken
referring – what Ken referred to as the pivot more to the NQM, more to the jumbo mortgage origination product
and these other initiatives that are being done there that will mitigate that.

It's – it also doesn't have kind of factored in what they expect to do in terms of growth. So last year, we mentioned
we had – we have 860 mortgage warehouse clients that we have not mined for MSR lines, for warehouse lines
and for deposits from that group. That compares to just over 100 that we have on the bank ourselves.
And so, we now have staffed up for that and we expect to mine that group already. And as we get into that, that
will improve, I think, what their performance has been. And on the net interest income side, mitigate that. But
you're still going to see pressure on the fee revenue side from mortgage operations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. I understand that. I just keep coming back to this – that last bullet point, but does the last bullet point where
interest rate sensitivity says it could be dampened by half. Do we, therefore, pro rate the NII impact you show on
the left side or totally different?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No, no, no. And maybe we should be more fair here. It's not just the rate sensitivity is going to be cut by half. It's
that the addition to PPNR from a higher rate environment. So we're showing – so for example, $377 million over
two years and an eight-quarter rising rate environment. We're saying that, okay, if I – that number could be more
like $180 million or $190 million flowing to PPNR. $377 million is what you're going to see in net interest income,
but you're going to see lower ramps or slower levels in fee revenue. So that's the PPNR change as opposed to
just net interest income when you get to the 50% haircut potentially.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And just in the resi loan yields just the detail here. The loan yields continue to compress [ph] 309 to 289
(00:36:42). I would have expected those went the other direction and lifted this quarter. And maybe that's a mix
issue in terms of what you're selling versus retaining. Could you just cover that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. You're right. What we're – our current on the run acquisitions now were in the lower 3s. And so, I would
think that that has bottomed out.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess just first, I wanted to follow up on the legal investigation that you flagged, Ken. One, is the expense
related to the initiation of the investigation this quarter and should we expect the legal expense line going back to
where it has been just from a numbers standpoint? And then what drew management to or the board to initiate
this because it felt like at least about 60 days ago you didn't see a need for having in a standalone investigation
versus what the ESPN was doing. So would love to hear some color around that. How quickly can this get
wrapped up so that this no longer remains an overhang on the stock?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So let me take the expense question first. Really, there's not been any major impact at all to the legal line,
and I'm not expecting that to balloon out in any way, shape or form. So we answer questions that come to us from
the NBA. I don't expect this investigational review to really add in any material way to the legal expense line item.
To your second point, I would probably correct your assumption upfront. The Independent Board members have
been very much engaged from the very beginning of this ESPN report and NBA investigation. And this is just the
next step and they're doing their appropriate due diligence and handling their fiduciary responsibilities to the
company. So I just think it's the – it's just the next step in the whole process.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

And is there a timeline by when we probably conclude all of this?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So really, this is being handled by the Independent Directors and their Counsel, and I'm really not in a position to
comment on the scope or duration of the investigation. Sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess a separate question just around rate sensitivity. I think you mentioned that you expect the
margin to have bottomed out and move higher as the Fed moves. Dale, if you can give us a sense of
understanding the rate floors, what should be the lift to the margin from Fed hikes, if any? If you could quantify
that, that would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

...variable rate loans are at the floor. We're not going to see much there. Conversely, I think there's a lot of
liquidity in the industry. And I don't see where pricing pressure would come from other institutions or on a
competitive basis to increase funding costs.
And so, it does start out fairly modestly and then climbs. So I mean, it's going to be kind of single-digit millions for
the first increase. And then, the next number will be a multiple of that. And then it'll probably double again as we
get, say, 75 to 100 basis points off of the floor. And then it's going to be more ratable based upon the overall mix
of our loans that are variable rate, which is substantial.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And if I can sneak in one last one. I think, Ken, you mentioned that you think the $9.80 EPS from
consensus should be a floor; you should do better than that. What are you assuming in terms of gain on sale
income, given what the forward curve is telling us about rates? Do you see – how meaningful of a decline do you
see in gain on sale relative to the fourth quarter levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, so the first quarter is also seasonally challenged as is Q4. And so, I wouldn't look for improvement in gain on
sale in 1Q. After that, I think that sector starts picking up, I'm going to say kind of early spring, late winter, summer
– March timeframe. And so, we're looking for improvement in Q2 and Q3 going forward.
And then by the time we get to the second half of the year, our mix will have changed and will be less dependent
upon GSE paper and more on NQ, non-qualified mortgage paper, which again has tighter margins in it. So, we're
looking for things to be improving really starting in the second quarter but carrying through 2022.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
Just to circle back on the last comment on residential production. I guess is there a good way to think about it kind
of the next two quarters of the product out of AmeriHome is still primarily conforming. You're going to use that
time to continue building the resi book on balance sheet. And then as that product switches to non-conforming or
largely more so non-conforming in the backend of the year, all that production will be sold off. And I guess when
that switch occurs, will that trigger a change in your appetite for production out of AmeriHome or will that level still
be the same, just going through the gain on sale line?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So I just want to correct one assumption first. What we're buying from AmeriHome today or what
AmeriHome is selling to the Commercial side of our business are the non-QM and jumbo loans, all right? So we're
not housing these conventional loans on our balance sheet that they buy in as part of their correspondent lending
business and then they turn around and then they put them to the GSEs.
So for us today, we both have – we have an AmeriHome inflow for non-QM and a jumbo loans, and we had this
program started before we purchased AmeriHome. And so, we have from our 100 or so clients, a group that
continue to offer us forward flows. So as AmeriHome's volume picks up, we'll probably decrease the forward flows
from our existing customer base, but always looking at what is the best return we can get, either from AmeriHome
or from our existing customer base. Does that help you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just maybe looking at the average levels of loans
held for sale versus the period end balance, is that the typical trend that those balances kind of pick up throughout
the quarter and then there's more selling towards quarter-end? And I guess as we head into next year, are those
average balances kind of what we should be using for our assumptions for loans held for sale or is there going to
be a step-down here in the first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So you may have noticed this before we had AmeriHome, Timur, but we'd say our loans tend to peak at or
near kind of month end and especially quarter-end. And so, our average balance tends to lag that of our ending
periods. I call it the telephone wire, although there aren't any more telephone wires anymore kind of a
phenomenon, where it picks up and then groups down again.
And so, to basically address that and to have a more stable earning asset level throughout the quarter, intra-
quarter, we have had to reverse basically plan for the held-for-sale book at AmeriHome because that's such a
short window we can play with that. And so, we have driven up average balances lower than the ending balances.
And you add them together, and you get something a little more stable in terms of averages and endings.
Going forward, I think we're there. We're – we've taken the held-for-sale portfolios kind of where we want them to
be. I'm not looking for continued growth in there, neither on an ending nor an average basis necessarily. And
meanwhile, again, now that we've ramped that up, now that we have sopped up the liquidity that we have when
we acquired AmeriHome, we were sitting on $6 billion in cash.
Where our focus is now? Okay, what do we want to put on the held-for-investment book? And that's what Ken
was referring to in terms of continuing to grow the residential piece. But with these non-qualified mortgages that
15

are really good quality. These are low LTV. They're in the mid-to-high 60s on LTV, [ph] 760 (00:46:17) FICO, debt
to income in the mid-30s. And we think that's going to be pretty impervious to kind of swings in the business cycle
and the residential valuation cycle as well.

Good morning, Brad.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Dale, you're using kind of the NBA data as a proxy. Your mortgage market share has kind of been plus or minus
2% for the past couple of quarters. I was curious if you had an idea of kind of where you might see that increasing
to over the next, I don't know, 12, 18 months as you guys kind of continue to take share, if that's one way to think
about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, we have a pretty flexible model whereby we can step up on the share space to continue to take volume. So,
I think that's going to really depend upon what else we see kind of going on. We are sensitive to the – how the
elastic demand and pricing is in that space. We don't want to come in so strong that we start kind of pushing down
pricing overall. But within that parameter, I think we're – we could be taking up share to, again, address the
expectations that we have from AmeriHome away from what they're doing on our balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And just curious, you addressed kind of the level of held for sale that's going to remain pretty stable from here.
But just kind of curious, if you do hold those for longer and generate more interest income, does that impact your
gain on loan sale at all? Just kind of curious if there's a bit of a trade-off there. Maybe we're not seeing it as much
in fee income, but you're picking up more NII. Just kind of curious to kind of how the two pieces might work
together.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Let me say bingo. That's exactly what the conversation is, and we work with our – we work with
AmeriHome very closely to make sure that the net economics are better for the bank, whether it be just taking the
loans in, holding them for three weeks, and then putting to the GSEs. We're getting a full gain on sale that way, or
by having them reside and nest on our balance sheet for a longer period. So, we look at it both ways, and
wherever the best economics are, that drives what we do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
So if those loans just sort of reached kind of a steady level and you guys continue to take share, you could
actually see, all else being equal, that maybe the gain on loan sale fee income line improved a bit first quarter
kind of notwithstanding due to seasonality?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Correct. Yeah. That's a fair comment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just on the servicing piece, I know it's not a big number, but you've got a pretty large servicing
portfolio now and I think you're only generating a couple of million bucks. Can you kind of talk about some of the
puts and takes there? It just seems like a low number again. Not huge numbers, but just kind of curious where
that could head.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So I mean, I appreciate that, Brad, because – so, I mean, the servicing piece, it has been affected by MSR
dispositions we've undertaken. There's deconversion costs associated with that that have come out of that line as
a [ph] contra route (00:49:57). And so, slowing down MSR dispositions could increase that number as well.
We also think that I'm going, let's say, the back half of last year, there was more refi activity than was expected.
And I think what the reason for that is because there has been such an appreciation of home values nationwide
that other – some people, even as though it wasn't necessarily economically and advantageous to refi did so
anyway because they wanted cash out to be able to take some of that equity out to do for whatever they pleased.
As we see rates rise more, I don't know that that trade really is going to make sense. I think you're probably better
off leaving your first mortgage as is, getting a home equity credit line on top of it at a higher rate rather than
refinancing the whole thing. So I think that may slow down also. If that were to slow down, that would also result in
less amortization of MSR premiums as those lives lengthen out. And that's irrespective of that they probably will
lengthen out just as rates rise to begin with which both of those will be positive for servicing rather.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Thank you. And then final question for me just for Ken on the C&I side of things with some really nice
growth this quarter. I was curious if you could just maybe offer a little more color. Is that line utilization coming
17

back with some of that purchased again? Do you feel like there's some real momentum out there on the C&I side
as things get back to normal and businesses rebuild inventories and things like that or is that kind of still to come
in terms of the growth you're seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I would say the growth we're seeing is what we've been seeing almost throughout the year. Okay? That
warehouse funding for the most part has been very strong throughout the year. A little bit quieter in Q4 though.
Subscription lines and capital call lines continue to perform well and they did so in this quarter as well. And they
were up about – let me say, I'll tell you what they were up rather right here. Yeah, they were up about $660
million. So that helped. We had good growth in the hotel sector. We grew that about $380 million. And then our –
all our regional lines or our businesses, they grew collectively this quarter nearly over $1 billion as well. So it was
a good quarter, I'd say. And sometimes I'll just say when we talk about warehouse lending – there are three
components to warehouse lending. The traditional warehouse lending was relatively flat. But MSR line that we
capture in that number, they grew nearly $200 million. And then we have a note financing business, again under
the whole heading of warehouse lending, and that grew another $0.25 billion. So that's where we saw the growth
for Q4.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks for the question. Dale, I know you mentioned the low 40s on the efficiency ratio. I'm interested kind
of near term as this mortgage business gets reset a bit, can you maybe speak to some of the flexible expenses
that would come out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So – well, a few things. So Q1 is always a scenario that's a little bit tighter. We see a reload on expenses,
payroll taxes, certain of our professional fees, and then the revenues contracted because there's only 90 – we're
dropping 2 days, 92 to 90. And that's going to have an effect on the efficiency ratio. They're probably going to take
it to, I'm going to say, 43%, 44% in Q1.
But then, from there, what AmeriHome was – can do is, again, kind of process and rightsize whatever makes
sense in terms of where they are on their profile given their opportunity. But overall, we think we're pretty strong in
terms of – on our efficiency profile and expense outlines.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. I wanted to touch on loan growth expectations with the guidance of $2 billion per quarter. Are you expecting
a similar composition as last year Q4 for this year? And do you anticipate any changes within that composition,
especially with the change in strategy with AmeriHome in the back half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. No, I think, in general, what we're seeing now and we expect to continue is a broadening out of credit
demand across our business lines. And so, it started – during the pandemic, it was very narrow. It was basically
mortgage warehouse lines and residential real estate and capital call lines. Now, we're seeing, as Ken mentioned,
we've got – we've seen increases in tech, increases in hotel, increases in the regions. I think that's going to
continue. Where you could see maybe a little bit of an accordion element is in the residential side. So if our
deposit growth shines, we're not going to push obviously on credit underwriting. And so, the valve to pick up that
increased liquidity is going to really push on the residential piece on the NQM that we've talked about.
And so, at a baseline level performance, I expect to see kind of the residential fees to be somewhere – similar to
what you alluded to. Maybe – it was just over 40% in Q4, something in the 30s and 40s or whatever is probably
pretty typical. If we're outsized on deposit growth, then you're going to see the residential piece pick that up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then you mentioned how hotel franchise finance bounced back in the quarter. You also
mentioned tighter underwriting. And I wonder if I could any more details on what sort of underwriting standards
you're applying now compared to where they were before.

Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks. We, I think, have benefited over the last year really in being able to underwrite some of the best
structures in part because there was some pullback. So what we're still seeing in that is very low loan-to-cost,
19


Western Alliance Bancorp.
(WAL) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
loan-to-value advances. We're seeing it with the flags and asset type that we prefer. So we're seeing it in our
target market. And we're typically still underwriting with going-in reserves that we wouldn't have prior to the
pandemic. So I would call it conservative and thoughtful underwriting and well-priced.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. When you mean reserves, you mean both operating reserves for somewhere between 6 and a 12-month
period and also payment reserves for principal and interest again for a 6 to 12-month period.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Correct. Thanks, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then as far as the loan yields on that book, how have they trended since – there's been sort of a
reopening of the economy. Have loan yields kind of come down some based on what they were last year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, in the midst of the pandemic, we were doing some underwriting still with – on hotel properties and into the first
part of 2021, the yields were higher there because there was less competition. And that's what we demanded to
do underwriting at that time. In addition to what Tim said, we had tighter underwriting standards. So, as more
people have come back into the market, a number of our floors have dropped. We're still getting better pricing in
that segment than we are elsewhere in our book of business. But yes, it has come down somewhat throughout
2021. Still great. Very good risk adjusted returns here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then lastly, I wanted to touch expenses. I just wanted to get a sense of what your investment priorities
are for the year and also get an understanding as far as how hiring has gone. I know talent acquisition has been
tough in this inflationary environment and with "the great resignation" but I just wanted to get an update on that
and the plans for the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So we had a net growth in hiring this quarter which is good. I agree that there is a war for talent and we're
out there trying to hire as many people as we can as soon as we can. And we have appropriately so changed
compensation level inside of the bank to retain people as well as to attract new people. What I said in my opening
remarks, our efficiency ratio, our productivity improvements have been so significant that it's been able to capture
the increase in the cost of new hires and retaining people. So that's question one. What was the other question?

that investment has been in our numbers and will continue to be in our numbers, both for risk management and
technology. For new business lines, it's interesting. The new business teams that we have brought on, fortunately,
because they're such senior seasoned bankers with great relationships, they'd come on and probably inside of six
months on a run rate basis, those groups are paying for themselves already. So we don't have a large trend in
bringing on new teams. At least we haven't yet. All right?
And then in terms of stuff that we're doing organically embedded in our low 40s efficiency ratio guide is the
incremental work we're doing, for example, with Tassat to get our blockchain payment system up and running. But
also included in there are new business lines that we are beginning to build or examine that we hope will help us
towards the back end of 2022 and give us some momentum into 2023. So we always look at our budgets as a
eight rolling quarter process, so we can lay out what we think is the appropriate spend in year one and begin to
see what's going to happen in year two in terms of a payback.

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. A couple questions. First, Dale, I just want to make sure I understood kind of the
mechanics or context around that credit loss note recovery. Is it simply that the additional CLNs issued in the
fourth quarter reduces the exposure under the expected loss model, that that's why you're...

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No. Yes, exactly. So we sold the credit-linked note that – so we received the proceeds of about $230 million. And
with that, they take first loss, the buyers of that note take a first loss on a $4.55 billion portfolio of residential
mortgages. And so we have no loss unless the losses on those loans is more than 5%, which seems beyond
astronomical to me. I mean, we've never had a loss on these loans to begin with. And so we have – but in any
event, that's what they're responsible for that.
And so – but yet, because the loans are still in our books, within CECL, the ACL, we have a reserve on those
loans of $7 million, that that's what the ACL computation is. And so with that, now that we have somebody else
taking that loss, we're still responsible for that loss, but we have a direct offset that we would claim that loss by
paying back the notes that they bought from us, the note amount less the losses that have been put to them
because they own the first loss position on that and that's the $7 million gain. So you could do this in the same
quarter. I mean – and we are. I mean, we're originating residential mortgages. We expect that we're going to
continue to put them out to a third party in most cases. The reason why we do that is because once you've done
this process, you reduce it from a 50% risk weighting to a 20% risk weighting. It is cheaper to do this and to pay
the note to this third party than it is to issue common stock to cover that 30% reduction in RWA.

But one other thing that Dale said, I would like everyone on the phone to know that we're going to be coming to
market with this on a periodic basis. So we're – you're going to see this happen again during the course of 2022,
either another time or maybe at least two times. So this income that we're getting from it is going to find its way
into the P&L. And then if – Dale, you want to take the second half of that? It then accretes back in and is a cost.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
It's just parallel to what is in the ACL. So, we have $7 million in the ACL that is a contra-asset. And now, we have
$7 million that is a contra debit or contra liability that takes off of how much we owe this market. This should go
back and forth. I mean, they're just – you staple them together. That was my point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. Right. So it just effectively shows up on the fee line versus via a reduction to the ACL which would be a
little more intuitive. So my...
[indiscernible] (01:06:34)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
...question is what – the first time you did this back in the – what – it was in the second quarter, why was there not
a similar kind of turnout?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I mean, there effectively was [indiscernible] (01:06:46). But I would say that the dollar amount for this piece is
larger than the one that first one was. Yeah, it was only $400,000 from the one for the first one. So the $7 million
is overwhelmingly the residential.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thanks for the color. And then, just one additional question. Ken, in terms of your comments regarding a
kind of shift in production and I think a third of the clients approved on the non-Q on the jumbo doing about $200
million a month. So if you roll that out and all your clients are approved and they double their production, that's
$3.5 billion to $4 billion a quarter, give or take, in terms of that type of production. So is the idea that the overall
mix will shift and be maybe 25% of that kind of production and the rest will remain conventional? Is that the way to
think about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Boy, I love your math, that 100% of 850 clients are all in on the program. So, I love your enthusiasm on that. But
we know that's not going to be the case. So, I don't think you're going to see $3 billion a quarter. But I do think
towards the end of 2022, you should be able to see from wherever we are about $1 billion a quarter. Okay? And a
lot of this is going to depend on how quickly we can get our client base educated, trained and approved and then
get them rolling out this product, which we think they want.
And then again, for us, we're going to look at the dynamics and we're going to – we set internal benchmarks here
and if it is better – first of all, it all depends on our liquidity all the time and how much we carry on the balance
sheet. But if we see better economics to sell a loan away from us, that's what we're going to do. If we see better
economics that we want to keep it, that's what we're going to do. And so it provides us a lot more optionality. It
just goes to show really what we've been saying since the day we purchased AmeriHome that a mortgage
company inside of a bank has many levers that it can pull that provide income streams to the parent company that
they could not pull or use if they were a standalone company. And so that's what we kind of like about
AmeriHome. And so I hope that answers your question.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Chiaverini with Wedbush Securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hey, thanks. A question on the M&A pipeline, particularly non-bank as it relates to. You made the announcement
about Digital Disbursements. Any – could you talk about your appetite for additional transactions like that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So as a general rule, one of the first lenses of thought that goes into whether or not we want to do a transaction is
what is the return on management's time. We've got a lot of organic growth opportunities and we are, as you can
tell, very excited by them. And as you've seen from our production either on the loan side or deposit side being
very successful with the ones that we've launched and the ones that we've been cultivating. So the first thing is
return on management time.
If there are products or certain niches that are very good for us to bolt on to our existing program, we like those.
All right? We're not out there like many of the other banks fishing for a partner to do a sizable deal. I always say
that that's not we're looking for. But of course, we're pretty opportunistic. If something falls in our lap, we will
quickly recalibrate and see if it works for us. But right now, that's not the conversations we're having where it's
more along the smaller lines and also really on what can generate transitional or transformational growth like we
think the blockchain payment program can do over time once we get comfortable with the mechanics of it and
once we bring in incremental clients to the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q

That makes sense. Thank you.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two questions. On the guide for EPS in 2022, you're talking about a
steeper ramp maybe later in the year. How steep of a ramp are you talking about? I have a $2.24 for the first
quarter, a $2.62 for the fourth quarter on consensus. And I don't really care about the first quarter. I'm interested
more in the fourth quarter. So I – just help us understand how steep that ramp is throughout the year.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So I would consider haircutting your Q1 a bit, and say that number was 10%, throwing 10% onto the back
half would be appropriate for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes. Okay. And you feel like it's sustainable EPS growth? I know you talked about some of the carve-outs, but
again, I'm just trying to think about 2023. I know that's a long way out, but that's sustainable is what I'm thinking
about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I mean, so – and really I'm going to look to the balance sheet for this. But we believe we've got momentum
on these, on what we put out here already. As we indicated, we haven't factored in any of these kind of new
developments and initiatives both with regarding the deposit side as well as some of the AmeriHome deals. We
are constructive on the economy overall as well. And I don't know how many rate increases we're going to get.
But to me, it's probably going to be at least for we're personally dialing in three this year, March, June and
September. But I don't think they're going to be done with that and that should give momentum also. So yes, I
mean, I realize there are implications of what we're talking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, Jon, your question...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Let me just – let me ask you one more thing, Ken, before – and this may tie into if you want to add on to it. But
Dale, you just touched on it. There's a lot of questions on mortgage, and it's – I know that they're not the easiest
to answer. But do you guys want higher short-term rates? Is that positive for earnings? And if someone takes the
over on rate hikes, is that positive for you when you mix it all together?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. The answer is yes. Go back to that slide 8, well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
And Dale was saying those numbers represent net interest income increases. Take half of that and that falls to
the PPNR line, right? And so yeah, it's beneficial for the company. And certainly once you clear the third going on
to the fourth rate hike, all our – most of our floors will be in the rearview mirror and we're going to get a higher
beta improvement on the loans that we carry, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes. Okay. And then just last one. Longer term return on tangible thinking as rates rise. I know you got some
provision questions in there. But can you hold this level of returns?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I mean, we're at 9.1% right now on CET1. Could that stay to 9.3%, 9.4%? So there's maybe a little bit of capital
implication there. I do think that we're – as we said, we're going to see margin expansion, particularly in a rising
rate environment. That would hold us pretty close to where we are now. Even if rates didn't move up or they
plateau more quickly, I still don't see how we fall out of the 20s.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
