MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Bank of America Fourth Quarter Earnings
Announcement Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you'll have the
opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's
call is being recorded.
And it's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead.

Lee McEntire
Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Bank of America Corp.
Good morning. Welcome and thank you for joining the call to review our fourth quarter results. I hope by now
you've all had a chance to review the earnings release documents. As usual, they're available, including the
earnings presentation that we'll be referring to during the call on the Investor Relations section of
bankofamerica.com's website. I'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening
comments and then ask Paul Donofrio, our CFO, to cover the details of the quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, just let me just remind you that we may make forward-looking
statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call that regards various elements of our
financial results. Forward-looking statements are based on our management's current expectations and
assumptions that are subject to risk and uncertainties, and particularly as we continue to operate during this
pandemic period. Factors that may cause actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our
earnings materials and SEC filings that are available on the website. Information about our non-GAAP financial
measures, including reconciliations to US GAAP, can also be found in those materials.
With that, I am happy to turn the call over to Brian. Take it away, Brian.

Brian T. Moynihan
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Lee, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us today. Before I pass the call to Paul
to review the fourth quarter, I wanted to hit a few points. First, I want to provide some brief commentary on 2020,
for the full year, then talk about what we see in the economy as we enter 2021, and then highlight some areas
where I believe we made strong strategic progress that will drive momentum into 2021 and beyond.
So starting on slide 2. 2020 was a tough operating environment as you all know. In that period, we generated net
income of nearly $18 billion or $1.87 of EPS and earned a return above our cost of capital. Our EPS was down
32% compared to 2019 driven by the impacts of coronavirus pandemic on the company and the economy. As you
know, the Fed dropped rates to nearly zero; long rates also fell to historic lows. Loan demand surged and then
waned as the panic subsided. That reduced net interest income but, as we told you last quarter, we believe NII
had likely bottomed in the third quarter of 2019. In fact, we saw a modest improvement this quarter, which Paul
will cover later, despite the challenges from lower loans. Non-interest revenue declined slightly but included some
interesting dynamics, highlighting diversity of Bank of America's model. Consumer fees declined driven by the
activity levels of clients but also by higher account balances in customer accounts. That's a good thing for the
economy going forward.

Our business mix allowed us to benefit from more market-related activities in sales and trading, investment
banking and investment brokerage in the Wealth Management businesses. Our full year revenue of $15 billion
from sales and trading rose 17% and we generated more than $7 billion of investment banking revenues this
year, an increase of 27% over last year. Investment and brokerage revenue grew 5% to nearly $15 billion.
Our expenses were higher as a result of the many costs associated with COVID and the support for our teams,
our clients and our communities we serve. For a comparison of 2019 and 2020, 2020 included the third quarter
addition of merchant services costs following dissolution of the joint venture in the third quarter of 2019. These
costs were always incurred as a net revenue deduction under joint venture accounting but now come through our
expense line.
Setting aside the elevated COVID-related expense and the change in accounting for merchant services, our
teams continue to do a good job managing costs, and you'll see that later when Paul will talk about it, and
maintained a focus on user and productivity gains to fund all the investments we're making across the franchise
and including increasing client flows. Expenses then remained relatively flat year-over-year, and we expect them
to be flat for 2021 versus 2020.
Provision was higher as a result of reserves built given the macroeconomic deterioration experienced in the first
part of the year. This also reflects the new CECL accounting rules which were adopted as of January 1, 2020. But
as the macroeconomic outlook improved, we released some reserves in the fourth quarter.
As we look at share count, it declined 7% driven by the amount of shares bought as we â€“ moving into second half
of 2019 and then in the first quarter of 2020 prior to us suspending share repurchases. With $36 billion of excess
capital above our common CET1 minimum requirements and excess capital above SLR reverting back to its
normal calculation and completion of the CCAR exam, we'll once again begin repurchasing shares starting today.
As you know, our first priority for use of all our capital is to grow our business organically, and we have funded
growth in many areas. And we have funded expanded minimum wages to $20 an hour for all our teammates, we
funded increased COVID benefits, and we've taken care of all that. Now we're looking to return as much capital to
our shareholders as we're allowed and as our board deems prudent.
So you saw this morning the beginning of that in a separate press release that our board has approved share
repurchase in the first quarter of up to $3.2 billion, including shares issued to employees. This is in addition to
maintaining our quarterly dividend of $0.18 per quarter, and that accounts for return of another $1.6 billion of
capital. This is the maximum allowed under the Fed's guidelines established for the first quarter 2021. Beyond the
first quarter, when we find out what the rules are, we'll continue to change our authorizations to reflect those rules.
In summary, it was a good year given the circumstances of the health crisis and the impact on the economy and
the markets around the world. I want to thank my teammates for the hard work they did to serve our clients, to
serve our communities and to help each other.
As we begin the new year, let's turn to the economy, and what we see is a continued recovery occurring.
Consumer spending by our clients and asset quality continued to improved. Our companies are highly liquid and
generally in pretty good shape except of course for those industries that are most hard-hit by COVID. As the
economy continues to push ahead, these companies that are operating will need operating capital, and we saw
early signs of loan demand stabilizing as we went through the fourth quarter. As we all know, there's one priority,
and that's to get everyone vaccinated so the healthcare crisis is behind us and, therefore, the economy can regain
its strength.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
Our research team just this past week has upgraded the 2021 forecast. Their view is that US GDP growth will be
around 5% and global forecast for growth are 5.4%. Let me give you a snapshot of what we see in our customer
data that supports some of our views for growth. On slide 3, you can see the consumer payments. With 66 million
consumer and small business clients making payments across all our channels, we have a rich dataset that
provides a deep view of the US consumer payment trends and small business trends. You can see this on slide 3.
This chart shows solid lines reflecting cumulative change to the year in spending. The dotted line shows the year-
over-year change for each month during the year in total spending.
Consumer payment activity began and ended the year very strong. In the first two months of the year, payments
were up high single digits year-over-year. By April, given the early spread of the pandemic and the full across the
board economic lockdowns, which is different in the status we are now, payments dropped and were down 26%.
By early summer, payments snapped back, and you can see that here with the reopening of economies in many
areas, the impact of government stimulus and increased unemployment.
As some of those funds were depleted and ran off, and the volumes, in fact, grew back to normal levels, we saw a
slowdown in the rate of the recovery. But still, spending managed to grow at a level consistent with pre-pandemic
prior year periods. And as we entered the holiday period which was lengthened this year by the difference in
activity of retail purchasing, the trends continued to strengthen. Total payments in the month of December hit a
high of $304 billion, up 8% year-over-year driven by a record volume of holiday spending. Full year payments
reached a new high of $3.1 trillion, up 2% year-over-year.
So one of the things we have done here is provide a pie chart in the lower left-hand side of this page for an
important reason. When we think about consumer spending, we think about all the ways consumers take money
and consume and spend it to do things. This is outside of just debit and credit spending habits which tend to get
all the discussion because they're easier to track, quite frankly. But they represent 75% of transaction volume but
only about 20% of the dollar volume of transactions, and you can see that they make up that smaller amount on
the lower left-hand side. And especially as travel and entertainment spending has shifted away, actually we've
been seeing debit spending outgrow credit spending. So 80% of dollar volume payments made by our consumers
happen through person-to-person payments, person-to-business payments, ACH, wires and many other means
including cash taken out of ATMs and spent and checks written.
So in terms of transactions, you can see at the bottom right of this chart how the physical payment of cash and
checks have moved to more digital forms which create operational efficiencies for us and has been a strategic
initiative for many years and one that was moved forward by the crisis.
Full year 2020 cash and check transaction, the volume fell to lowest on record, down 21% as COVID accelerated
the migration to digital card-based payments. 2021 has begun as a strong year for payments. The new stimulus
checks started hitting customers' accounts in the first weeks of January. More than 11 million of those payments
have hit our accounts, about $11 billion, and they flowed into the accounts mostly from digital transfers through
IRS.
So how payments performed in the first half of January? The first half of January, across all these payment types
is up 6.7% from 2020. In good news, debit and credit is up 5.6%. Growth rates in total exceed pre-COVID levels
of growth rates and they're larger dollar amounts, so bigger dollars and faster growth rates. And that is with about
30% of the $600 payments being spent by our primary checking customers, so 70% more to be spent.

As we move to slide 4, we can see the activity on the commercial side. In the closing weeks of 2020, we continue
to see some stabilization mainly driven by our middle market auto finance clients as inventories have gotten low
and they rebuild them. The chart on the top of slide 5 (sic) [slide 4] reflects the total global banking loans across
all segments, Business Banking, Global Commercial Banking, and Global Corporate and Investment Banking.
As you recall, in the first quarter of the year we experienced a heightened level of client draws on commitments as
the panic borrowing set in with the crisis, and that was about three years of normalized commercial loan growth in
a single month. And as you know, driven by capital markets for the GCIB clients and soft loan demand as people
gathered their wits about them and the crisis moved to a different stage, we saw significant paydowns on loan
balances. During the last two months of the year, we have seen more stable results that we hope can continue to
turn into increased demand and growth as we look forward.
On the chart on the bottom of the page, you can see that middle market and business banking, that core part of
the American economy, has started to tip up, but larger corporate loans continue to be affected by the markets
and declines of the period. A decade of operating under responsible growth principles prepared us well for this
crisis and allowed us to remain focused on our customer under a well-understood risk framework and support
them and the communities they live in. And, in fact, we have basically reopened all the credit underwriting to the
standards that we had before the crisis. We are well-positioned against this improving economic backdrop
because of progress we made in respect of our strategic initiatives over the many years.
Let's go to the next slide, slide 5, and we'll talk about the strategic progress. We can start with the Consumer
Bank in the upper left. As you know, we retain the number one deposit share position for retail deposits; that's
$800 billion-plus. And coupled with our wealth management deposits for American consumers, we have $1 trillion
in deposits now. We grew average consumer deposits $166 billion, or 23%. $108 billion of that $166 billion was
low-cost checking accounts.
Customer satisfaction ended the year at a new all-time high. And 25 of the top 30 markets across America,
representing over half of US population, we now hold the number one, two, or three leadership position, including
in 14 of those markets the number one position, which is twice as many markets as our closest peer.
Another important consumer objective has been the focus on digital banking. Digital engagement expanded
throughout all our businesses through the year. 69% of our consumer wealth management households are now
digitally active; not just enrolled, but active. That's up a couple hundred basis points and there's deep penetration
of customer base. These clients signed in 9 billion times this year, representing double-digit growth. And they
aren't just signing in for transactions or looking at their balances, they are also buying things. 42% of the sales this
year were digital sales. It expanded in areas of checking account sales, auto sales, and mortgage loan sales.
Erica, our digital assistant, users grew 67% to 17 million. They spent 1.4 million hours, those clients did, talking to
Erica, interacting with it. In Zelle, the P2P payment form, P2B payment form also, is up 80% year-over-year.
Remember those earlier payments charts on the earlier pages, there's a lot of growth ahead here and it helps us
move from higher cost to lower cost means. What's interesting about the Zelle customers is the depth of the
relationship they have with us. On average, they have three accounts with Bank of America, an average checking
balance of more than $9,000, and an average investment balances of $400,000 when they have investment
balances.
Now switching more broadly. Consumer investment balances, these are investment balances of mass affluent in
our Consumer business, surpassed a major milestone and moved over $300 billion with 3 million accounts. We
added 537 new funded accounts in 2020 in that mass affluent segment; that's up 27% year-over-year. In

September, we rolled out Life Plan, our financial planning that helps people prioritize their financial goals. And
we've had 2 million-plus plans created already, one of the fastest rollouts of a product we've ever had.
As we move to the Wealth Management group, we saw record client balances of $3.3 trillion through both market
appreciation and flows. Product integration continued to improve as Merrill clients utilized our checking services,
and their checking balances at Bank of America were up 28% year-over-year. And digital adoption by Merrill
clients increased as 43% of the checks deposited by Merrill clients were done digitally. And the private bank
clients continued the strong adoption with 70% of the checks they deposited were deposited digitally.
Despite the virtual environment, the inability to have face-to-face meetings â€“ and inherently, the Wealth
Management business is a face-to-face business â€“ household growth accelerated through the second half of the
year with Merrill adding 22,000 net-new households and the private bank adding 1,800. And indeed, we had a
record year for $10 million-plus new relationships across the two businesses.
When we turn to our commercial businesses, in Global Banking we focused on virtual services for clients through
the COVID crisis, increased our calling efforts 60% this year in terms of number of engagements with clients. We
saw a significant gain in our Investment Banking market share. Overall, in all areas, but particularly in our middle
market clients, we've achieved a strong position this year. This has been a multi-year effort of hiring more and
dedicating more bankers, investment bankers to be part with the commercial banking relationship managers
across the country.
Given the nature of clients and staff working from home, the digital capabilities we had allowed our client
development to continue. We saw record sign-ons through our CashPro app. This is the way a commercial
customer accesses that app in the commercial cash management businesses. In December alone, 14 of 22
business days there were over $1 billion moved on that app. This shows our clients' growing comfort level with the
system.
We reported record Investment Banking fees with three of our strongest quarters in the company's history this
year. We improved our overall fee ranking to number three as market share grew 70 basis points , is up for two
consecutive years in a row. These market share improvements include our highest-ever shares in equity capital
markets and M&A advice.
In fixed income trading and markets business, the trading side of the house, we continue to enhance our e-trading
capabilities, increase our system speed and ability to process customer trades even faster. In the equities trading
side of the house, we had our best year since 2009 when the merger of Merrill and Bank of America took place,
and we gained market share even while the market was growing in cash equities. We estimate we picked up 200
basis points in cash equities in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter last year.
The last point I want to mention is all the work we continue to do with our clients around our activities in
environmental, social and governance, including our award-winning proprietary research from the number one
research platform in the world, as well as sustainable financing initiatives, including green bonds, sustainable
bonds, and COVID-related bonds. Our team also committed $1 billion to further economic opportunities and
address racial injustice in the middle of the COVID pandemic. We've made significant progress and made
announcements over the last six months on the strong work done there.
And with that, let me turn it over to Paul for the quarter.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
Paul M. Donofrio
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I'm starting on slide 6 and 7 together. As I did last quarter, I will mostly compare
our results relative to Q3, as most investors we speak with are more interested in our progress as we traverse the
pandemic rather than comparison to pre-pandemic periods. In Q4, we earned $5.5 billion, or $0.59 per share,
which compares to $4.9 billion, or $0.51 a share, in Q3. Compared to Q3, the earnings improvement was driven
by lower provision expense, as we released $828 million in reserves, nearly offsetting net charge-offs, which also
declined. Also benefiting earnings, expenses declined $474 million from Q3 on lower litigation costs, and NII
moved from the Q3 trough.
Non-interest income declined from Q3, but results across individual line items were mixed. First, the decline in
other income was driven by seasonal client activity with respect to ESG investments, which created higher
partnership losses, but benefited our annual tax rate, as I have described in previous discussions. Our tax rate for
the year was 6%. If we adjust for the tax benefit of our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been
roughly 21%. I point this out to emphasize that the full year tax benefits of these socially responsible investments
more than offset the portion of losses recorded in other income throughout the year.
Relative to Q3, non-interest income was also impacted by lower sales and trading which typically slows from Q3
to Q4. But while sales and trading revenue was down linked-quarter, year-over-year it was up 7%. On the positive
side, non-interest income benefited from higher asset management fees as the market improved, and we grew
net-new households again this year. And finally, we had another good quarter of investment banking revenue
which increased from both the strong Q3 levels and year-over-year. Also, when comparing net income to Q3,
remember the Q3 tax expense benefited by $700 million from the revaluation of our UK deferred tax asset.
Finally, with respect to returns, note that our ROTCE was 11.7% and our ROA approached 80 basis points.
Moving to slide 8, the balance sheet expanded $81 billion versus Q3 to $2.8 trillion in assets, total assets. The
main point is that deposits are driving and funding substantially all of this growth. Deposits grew $93 billion in the
quarter and are up $361 billion from Q4 2019. On the other hand, loans declined from Q3. With deposits up, loans
down, excess liquidity is piling up in our cash and securities portfolios. Global liquidity sources are up $367 billion
year-over-year, and $84 billion just from Q3. In fact, global liquidity is up so much that it now exceeds total loans.
With respect to regulatory ratios, the standardized approach remains binding at 11.9%, consistent with Q3.
Shareholders' equity increased $4 billion as earnings were more than three times the amount of common
dividends paid, plus we issued preferred stock totaling $1.1 billion. But this was offset by higher RWA as we
invested more cash in securities. At 11.9%, our CET1 ratio is 240 basis points above our minimum requirement
which equates to a $36 billion capital cushion. Our TLAC ratio also increased and remains comfortably above our
requirements.
Before leaving the balance sheet, as usual we provide the charts on slide 9 and 10 to show the historical trends
with respect to average loans and deposits. For reference, we included these same charts on an end-of-period
basis in the Appendix. Overall, year-over-year total loans are down 4% and in the lines of business they are down
2%, the decline year-over-year was driven by lower revolver utilization and other pay downs in Commercial and
by pullback in credit card activity.
On slide 10, we provide the same trends by line of business for deposits. Brian already made a number of points
on deposits, and you can see the tremendous year-over-year growth in every line of business that led to 23%
growth in deposits for the company. At $1.7 trillion in deposits far surpasses any previous record for deposits.

We believe our strong deposit growth reflects our customers' overall experience with us as we continue to
innovate around digital capabilities, as well as enhance our nationwide physical footprint of financial centers and
ATMs, which have continued to prove important to customers and clients.
I will just add that given historically low interest rates, our rate paid on deposits declined modestly linked quarter,
and we are now lower than the rate paid to customers in 2015 before the Fed began raising rates. And I will point
out that our interest cost on $1.7 trillion of deposits this quarter was only $159 million.
Turning to slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q4 was $10.25 billion, $10.37
billion on an FTE basis. While net interest income declined [audio gap] (00:25:55-00:26:00) from Q3. The
improvement from Q3 was driven by the increased deployment of excess deposits into securities.
Lower loan balances, lower reinvestment rates and modestly higher mortgage-backed securities premium write-
offs mitigated the improvement in NII. The net interest yield was relatively stable, declining only 1 basis point from
the Q3 level.
Note that, given all the deposit growth plus the low starting point with respect to interest rates, our asset sensitivity
to rising rates remains quite large and is a good reminder of the value of these deposit relationships.
Now, with respect to NII, as we move into 2021, we offer the following perspectives: Our perspectives on NII is
assume that net interest rates follow the forward curve and do not move lower than current levels and that the
economy does not taking meaningfully step backwards as a result of recent negative COVID developments.
With that said, first, I would remind everyone that Q1 will be impacted by two less days of interest, which is a
headwind of nearly $200 million. Also, seasonally, we would expect to see payments related to holiday spending
result in lower card balances. We also have the continuing impact of higher yielding assets maturing or paying off
and being replaced with lower yielding ones.
Offsetting these headwinds, we currently intend to again invest a portion of our excess deposits, which continued
to grow in Q4 into securities. Having listed those specific Q1 impacts, NII improvement more generally will depend
on all the factors we are all focused on such as loan growth, PPP loan forgiveness and PPP new originations and
mortgage refinancings, as well as mortgage-backed security payment speeds, which impact the write-off of bond
premiums. Should those trends develop in a positive way, our NII and earnings will benefit.
One final note on NII. We added a slide in the Appendix that shows the difference between 2015 when short-term
rates were last this low and today. The important difference between then and now is the growth in our balance
sheet, which improved NII, and the decline in expenses since then.
Speaking of expenses and turning to slide 12. Q4 expenses were $13.9 billion, $474 million lower than Q3. The
decline was driven by a reduction in litigation expense. We also saw a reduction in COVID-related expenses,
primarily those associated with processing claims for unemployment insurance. Higher planned marketing costs
across the firm and revenue related processing and incentives mitigated the reductions.
As we move into 2021, remember, Q1 will include seasonally higher payroll tax expense, which we estimate at
roughly $350 million. Given the resurgence of COVID cases across the US and in Europe, we estimate that $300
million to $400 million of net COVID-related expense remained in our Q4 expenses. We continued to work hard to
lower these types of expense but not at the expense of the safety of our employees and customers. And outside

of these COVID costs, we continued to manage expense tightly using gains and productivity and digital activity to
mitigate other increases.
Turning to asset quality on slide 13. Our total net charge-offs this quarter were $881 million or 38 basis points of
average loans. Net charge-offs continued to benefit from years of responsible growth as well as government
stimulus and loan deferral programs. A $91 million decline in net charge-offs was driven by lower credit card
losses. The loss rate on credit card declined to a 20-year low of 206 basis points of average loans. Provision
expense was $53 million, which not only reflected an improvement in macroeconomic projections but also
incorporated uncertainties that remain in the economy due to the health crisis.
These considerations resulted in an $838 million reserve release this quarter, reducing consumer loan reserves
by $621 million and commercial by $207 million. Our allowance as a percentage of loan releases ended the year
at 2.04%, which is well above the 1.27% where we began the year following our Day 1 adoption of the CECL
accounting standards.
With respect to key variables used in setting our reserve, as done in previous quarters, we continued to include a
number of downside scenarios. Based on our Q4 2020 weighting of those scenarios, GDP is forecasted to return
to its Q4 2019 level in the early part of 2022. This improved by a couple of quarters relative to Q3. The weighting
scenario also resulted in an unemployment rate at the end of 2021 consistent where it is today just North of 6.5%.
On slide 14, we break out credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios. On the
Consumer front, COVID effects on net charge-offs continued to remain benign. Overall, Consumer net charge-offs
declined $82 million driven by card losses and remained near historic lows. We experienced modest increases in
delinquency and NPL levels, but they remained low and were expected given the deferral activity of customers.
While expired deferrals drove Consumer 30-day delinquencies modestly higher compared to Q3, importantly, they
remained 22% below the year-ago level. And Consumer deferral balances continued to decline in Q4, ending the
year at $8 billion. Moreover, balances are now mostly Consumer real estate related with strong underlying
collateral values.
We added a slide in our Appendix, which further highlights delinquency trends for credit card. It shows a modest
bulge of the expected deferral related delinquencies moving their way through time and into the 90+ bucket at
year-end. As the bulge of deferrals related to delinquencies passed through time periods, delinquencies receded.
As an example, in Q4, five-day delinquencies were down more than 30% year-over-year, which shows that after
deferrals pass through this time period, delinquencies fell and stayed lower. So assuming net losses follow their
historical relationship to delinquencies in the 90-plus-day bucket and no other changes in card payment trends,
we would expect card losses to be higher in Q1 but then decline in Q2.
Moving to Commercial, net charge-offs were relatively flat to Q3 even as we sold some loans in affected
industries, crystallizing losses but reducing risk. Overall, given the environment, the asset quality of our
commercial loan book remained solid and 89% of exposures were either investment grade or collateralized. Our
reservable criticized exposure metric continued to be the most heavily impacted by COVID and increased this
quarter by $3 billion from Q3, led by downgraded exposures in Commercial Real Estate primarily hotels.
Importantly, commercial NPLs, while up modestly, remained low at only 45 basis points of loans.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 15. Consumer Banking
throughout 2020 has been the segment most impacted, most heavily impacted by COVID. It bore the brunt of
revenue disruption from interest rates, customer activity and fee waivers. Reserve building impacted provision
expense, and expenses increased for PPP programs and protection of associates and customers.

In Q4, compared to Q3, revenue expenses and provision all improved. We earned $2.6 billion in Consumer
Banking in Q4 versus $2.1 billion in Q3, but with earnings still below prior year pre-pandemic levels, we know we
still have plenty of room for improvement.
Client momentum in this business continued to show strength around deposits and investment flows, while near-
term loan growth has been impacted by the decline in mortgage balances from heightened refinance activity.
Looking at the components of the P&L linked quarter, revenue growth included both higher NII and fees.
Consumer fees reflected an increased level of holiday spending, as well as higher investment account activity.
Even as revenue moved higher, expenses move modestly lower as we had a reduction in pandemic costs and
continue to realize the benefits of a more digitally engaged customer base.
As Brian noted and as you can see on slide 17, we saw an improvement in digital enrollment. Most importantly,
customer use of our digital capabilities increased with not only more sign-ons and higher digital sales, but also
more service fulfillment through digital channels as reflected by volume growth in both Erica and Zelle.
Note also that both our rate paid and cost of deposits declined. Cost of deposits is now 135 basis points. In the
past year, we added over 500,000 net new checking accounts, grew deposits 23%, and dropped our cost of
deposits 17 basis points even with the increase in costs associated with the pandemic.
Let's skip to Wealth Management on slides 18 and 19, and I will refer to both slides as I speak. Okay. Here again
the impact of lower rates on a larger deposit book pressured NII, impacting an otherwise solid quarter with
positive AUM flows, market appreciation and solid deposit and loan growth. Net income of $856 million improved
12% from Q3, as revenue growth and improvement in provision exceeded a modest increase in expense.
With respect to revenue, NII grew, driven by solid growth of both loans and deposits and asset management fees
grew to a new record on higher market valuations and solid flows. Expenses increased, driven by revenue-related
expense and investments in our sales force.
Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank both continue to grow households as we remained a provider of choice for
affluent clients. Client balances rose to a record of more than $3.3 trillion, up $302 billion year-over-year, driven
by higher market levels as well as positive client flows.
Let's move to our Global Banking results on slide 20. COVID has also heavily impacted Global Banking through
lower interest rates, softer loan demand and higher credit costs, but, here again, we saw improvement. The
business earned nearly $1.7 billion in Q4, improving $751 million from Q3, driven by lower provision expense and
improved revenue. On a year-over-year basis, earnings were $341 million lower driven by NII.
Looking at revenue and comparing to Q3, revenue improvement was driven by higher investment banking fees as
well as more leasing activity associated with our clients' ESG investments. Investment banking fees for the
company of nearly $1.9 billion grew 5% from Q3 and were up 26% year over year. As Brian noted, this
performance led to improved market share overall and in a number of key products.
Provision expense reflected a reserved release of $266 million in Q4, compared to a build in reserves of $555
million in Q3. Non-interest expense was higher compared to the linked quarter and year-over-year, primarily
reflecting investments in the platforms as well as support for the PPP program and also reflecting the recording of
merchant services expense given the change in accounting versus the year ago quarter. As Brian noted earlier,

customers continued to appreciate the ease, safety and convenience of our digital banking capabilities and usage
continued to grow, helping defray other costs.
We present some digital highlights on slide 22. As noted earlier, loans declined but saw stabilization late in the
quarter and continuing the trend since Q2, the spread of the loan portfolio continued to tick higher at spreads on
new originations on average exceeded the average spread of the portfolio. Average deposits increased 26%
relative to Q3 as businesses remained highly liquid.
Okay. Switching to Global Markets on slide 23. Results reflect solid year-over-year improvement in revenue from
sales and trading but a decline from the robust levels of Q3. As I usually do, I will talk about segment results
excluding DVA. This quarter net DVA was a small loss of $56 million. On that basis, Global Markets produced
$834 million of earnings in Q4, a decline from the more robust trading in Q3, but up markedly from Q4 2019.
Focusing on year-over-year, revenue was up 13% on higher sales and trading. The year-over-year expense
increase was driven by higher activity-based costs for both trading and unemployment claims processing. Sales
and trading contributed $3.1 billion to revenue, increasing 7% year-over-year, driven by a 30% improvement in
equities and a 5% decline in FICC. The strength in equities was driven by market volatility and investment
repositioning, which drove client activity higher.
The decline in FICC reflected strong credit trading performance, which was more than offset by declines across
most macro products and mortgage trading. As Brian noted, the year-over-year performance of this business has
been strong in every quarter of 2020. You can see that on slide 24, and that produced strong segment returns of
15% on allocated capital for the year.
Okay. Finally, on slide 25 we show all other, which reported a loss of $425 million. Compared to Q3, the decline in
net income was driven primarily by the prior quarter's tax benefit of $700 million associated with our UK deferred
tax asset, revenue decline from Q3 driven by the accounting for wind and solar and other ESG investments. We
also experienced some modest equity investment losses.
Expenses declined from Q3 on lower litigation expense, but were partially offset by higher marketing costs. For
2021, absent any changes in the current tax laws or unusual items, we would expect the effective tax rate to be in
the low double digits, driven by the level of ESG client activity relative to pre-tax earnings.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Lee and Brian for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.
Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question on expenses. Brian mentioned expecting the cost number to be
flattish in 2021 versus 2020. Just kind of wondering, is that all-in expenses, Paul, or some kind of core metric, if
you can give an outlook for the expenses that you expect and the COVID â€“ trend for COVID expenses this year.
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, John, that's all-in, given the sort of around $55 billion both years since we feel good about the ability to
keep bringing down COVID. It came out a little slower this quarter largely due to the fact that, if you go back and
think where we were in October on case counts, the need to continue to provide strong benefits to our
teammates, including the childcare in our homes so they could be effective. That's why we get those customer
scores and why the growth in checking sales was 70%, 80% of the normal year with half the â€“ 40% of branches
closed. So, yeah, flat year-over-year following number, and then we'll work in the dynamics underneath it.
But importantly, remember, we are investing $3.5 billion in technology next year, new financial center's expansion,
employees to help sell more, and we'll continue to drive it through. So you'll see sort of a change in the COVID
costs coming down hopefully as we move through the year, but we've got some work to do, but flat year-over-year
overall.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And then longer term, Brian, you've talked about getting back to a low $54 billion as kind of a run rate ex-
COVID. Is that still how you're thinking about things?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, we should start to work down. Again, as we've said many years ago, as we get in the out years and get
more and more efficient, the day-to-day, the quotidian cost of rent increases and pay increases work at you, but
the idea is to have a net expense grow sort of at 1% a year. So 3% up from just day-to-day cost to manage a
couple percents out, and so we'll continue to work that down in the future. We've got work to do on getting these
COVID expenses out of here.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I also wanted to follow-up on the efficiency. I mean, you're making big strides with digital banking in so many
ways with 39 million digital households are engaged. And you go through all those metrics and you see efficiency
ratio for the quarter of 69%. And if you take out your $400 million of COVID costs, maybe it would be 67%, but
that's still a far cry from the 57% to 59% where you had been. And I know low rates hurt a little bit, but either
you're investing more than you've disclosed, or there are some other COVID costs in there or you're not becoming
more efficient as you said in your opening comments, Brian. So, help me kind of reconcile your current efficiency
or my adjusted efficiency ratio with a more normal level.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, Mike, I take you back to page 11 on the net interest yield and the net interest income and realize that basically
in the four quarters last year, we realized $2 billion of revenue per quarter, which is the bridge from â€“ a lot of that
bridge. And so, as we work that back up and ultimately as rates rise, that $2 billion, that's per quarter, so $8 billion
in revenue with really no cost, that will go up. So we continue to get more efficient in our branches, as the cost of
operating over the deposit base is now 135 basis points, and we added 700,000 new checking accounts. So
you're right, but it's more affected by the revenue impact to NII than it is by anything else in terms of expenses.
We're saying net COVID-19 cost of $300 million, $400 million, that includes offsetting against all savings of travel
and stuff. The gross costs are obviously much higher than that. We opened up PPP today. We've got 5,000
employees ready to go to complete the next round of PPP and the forgiveness process, and as that finishes off
that stuff will come out of the system. So we got you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then the follow up to that, going to NII. I'm not sure if you gave a specific outlook or not, Paul, when you went
through that. I mean, as you said, liquidity is now greater than loans. Your loan-to-deposit ratio at close to 50%, I
think it's the lowest in history like ever, right? And also there's a lot of dry powder there. But did you give guidance
for NII for this year, assuming the forward yield curve stays where it is? And do you think you can somehow pull
out positive operating leverage this year or is that too tough, given the rate environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
We didn't give specific guidance. I can give you a little more color on our perspective on 2021. But I do think as
you think about how you want to estimate and model NII and how it may unfold in 2021, I think it's really helpful to
review the progress we made in 2020. There's a lot of clues there. Remember, in Q1 of 2020, interest rates fell to
historically low levels. Short rates were down 150 basis points and long rates were down 100 basis points, plus
loans declined significantly beginning in Q2 as demand weakened and larger companies assessed the capital
markets to pay down debt and build liquidity.
In the past when we've had situations like this where interest rates and/or loans have declined, it always takes
several quarters to reach a point where renewed balance sheet growth was significant enough to compensate.
We believe we've found that NII bottom in Q3 and NII indeed moved higher in Q4. All else equal, day count,
etcetera, it should become easier from here to grow NII.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
I think what helped us to start to grow again quickly in this crisis was the tremendous influx of deposits and our
relatively recent confidence to invest the excess in securities instead of holding that excess in cash. So our
continued investment of that cash in Q4 leads us to believe that we can offset the headwinds of low loan demand
in the near term, reinvestment yields and two less days of NII in Q1, leaving NII relatively flat in Q1 versus Q4,
before moving up through the balance of the year.
Remember, in Q2 and Q3, we picked back up those days of interest we lost in Q1. As Brian reviewed, we also
saw commercial loans stabilize at the end of Q4, providing hope that increased loan demand will soon follow.
Given that we expect some loan demand through the year and using the existing rate curve, which has steepened
over the past 90 days, we would expect NII in Q4 2021, for example, to be much higher than Q1 2021. And when
we get to the second half of 2021, year-over-year quarterly comparisons to 2020, as well as the second half of
2021 compared to the first half of 2020 should be quite favorable.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then when you say a lot higher in Q4 than Q1, bigger than a breadbox or I mean any
sizing to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Once we get the â€“ the simple way to think about it, Mike, is once you sort of get underneath the levels, you start
growing the loan growth. And we'd said we'll outgrow the economy in loan growth in normalized times, and that
feeds the NII.
Yeah, but we've got to work it back up from here. It's a four or five-quarter fight to get this huge balance sheet
turned and repositioned and just fight it down and have it grow back out. So we'll see.

Operator: And our next question's from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. You guys are pretty predictable and steady on this front, but I'm curious on your thoughts
on capital. I'm not sure your CET1's ever been higher, and your requirements are not going up. So as capital
continues to build and your G-SIB target is reasonably low relative to your big peers, just what are you thinking in
terms of how aggressive do you get on the capital return versus we don't talk much about bolt-on acquisitions with
you, but curious how you think about that? And if you might address asset management, particularly given your
great distribution franchise. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Then let's go backwards to that one, the big leverage point, but be more deposit acquisitions in markets we're not
and stuff like that. But we can't do it. It's illegal and has been for all the way back since GLBA or whatever it was
15


Bank of America Corp.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
20 or 30 years ago. So even before. But and then Asset Management, remember we sold our Asset Management
because we believed that being the large distributor is the priority. So don't expect us â€“ we look at stuff from time
to time like everybody does, but the way we built this company was organic growth and then delivering the capital
back to the shareholders.
And what's interesting, we'll see what the rules change, but remember that things like the SLR and the
accommodations that were given, we didn't need, and we have plenty of SLR. It doesn't have any constraints. It
doesn't become an issue that, like you said, even if you look at the SEB recalcs and stuff, we've got plenty over
that. So we will be aggressive on returning capital. We've got basically two months to return those $3 billion and
change we've got to return now, and then we'll see what the Fed instructions are. And then we'll get after it as we
move forward.
And we look at things from time to time, but there's just isn't much to consider in the United States right now. And
the best answer is to continue development of this franchise on an organic basis. And it works.
If you look in the markets where we've expanded our branch system to, we're averaging $100 million or more in
deposits per branch in the ones that have been open a couple of years and moving share up literally year by year
by year. And so we think that's where we've got to keep driving.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I appreciate all that. Is there a specific either buffer above the CET1 and/or you want to put it in the $36 billion
excess? Where's a natural resting ground? Not tomorrow but just whenever you get there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
We always said sort of 50 basis points above the relevant binding criteria is where you'd start slow down. But
remember, we're basically only getting back to earnings and so we got a lot of room between us and whatever the
requirements plus 50 basis points. And from time to time, those move around events to standardize, SLR,
whatever is binding, but think about that's where the board targets are.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Can you talk a bit about the timing of the liquidity deployment in the fourth quarter? I think
mortgage rates actually came down. And one could argue if you look out six to 12 months, longer-term rates will
be higher as vaccines get rolled out and the economy picks up. So obviously, you have tons of deposits but it's
also pretty long-duration assets I would think that you're buying. So if you could talk about that.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
Yeah, you're absolutely right, the 10 year was up in the quarter but rates and mortgage-backed securities, well,
certainly, mortgage rates to customers declined and rates and mortgage-backed securities I think declined
slightly. Having said that, we're always going to balance liquidity, capital and returns in profits. And we did deploy,
and as we said in our third quarter call, approximately $100 million of our cash and securities. It went into both
mortgage-backed securities and some treasuries in the quarter. And we think that was the right thing to do.
We understand the rate structure. We did get probably an improvement on our yield on that $100 billion of
approximately 125 basis points so. And I would say we've still got a lot of excess cash, Matt. If you look at our
balance sheet, cash grew by $70 billion, $80 billion this quarter. So I mean, that was the growth on top of what we
are ready had, net of deployment. So we still have a lot of room to invest in the future, and we plan to do some
more investments in Q2, but we're obviously always looking at the rate environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then I guess somewhat related. Is there a point where you just say, we don't want some of these deposits?
It's better to free up even more capital or just have a little bit more of an efficient balance sheet and not have to
make some of these tough decisions or charge for the deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, so if a customer comes to you to open a checking account; start a lifetime relationship, you'd never turn that
down whether it's a Commercial customer or Consumer customer for core deposits. And so if you look at the
growth, we're not bidding for CDs and money markets on the consumer side. You can see that $108 billion to
$160 billion was checking account balance growth. And by the way, when rates rose before, we continued our
checking account growth and we would expect that to continue as these are core customer relationships. So if
you go back and look as rates rose 2016, 2017, 2018, we continue to grow checking in double-digit type of
numbers quarter after quarter after quarter, which means you're just taking market share.
And so on the Commercial side the same thing, the GTS business. We are not out in the market taking short-term
deposits from people; haven't been. And so this is all real core stuff that we're getting paid to take and albeit it
gets sandwiched a little bit as the zero floors are hit in the Commercial side, frankly, that services overcome the
zero floor. But you'd be hard-pressed to turn it down so it's not like we have a lot of â€“ here's a few billion dollars;
can you put on your balance sheet and give us â€“ that just doesn't happen. We don't do that. We turned that down
already.

Hey. Thanks. Paul, just first off a follow-on question to the last one around the reinvestment into securities. Like
you mentioned, you did $92 billion or so this past quarter. So as we're thinking about the NII guidance you just
gave, should we be anticipating an increase into the securities book that's above and beyond that roughly $100
million run rate that you did in 4Q?

Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Look, we continue to assess the excess deposits, and we do expect to continue to deploy more cash into
securities. We're not really planning on disclosing how much more. But there is a meaningful amount in that
guidance that we gave you. The size and pace of the purchases are obviously going to be influenced by a number
of judgments, including things like expected loan demand and customer deposit behavior. So, yeah, I'm not going
to give you a number. But it's a meaningful increase that we're expecting to do in this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, okay. Got it. And then just separately in talking about credit, you indicated that the delinquencies are
suggesting that your NCOs are going to be coming down Q-on-Q in 2Q. And it's a pretty stunning statement given
that we still have this unemployment rate where it is. Can you just talk a little bit about why you would expect
that's happening in your book of business? Do you just have a population that's really not being impacted by the
unemployment rate? Maybe if you could give us some color there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Sure. Now, I want to correct â€“ I think I heard you say something. You may not have said it, but I want to make
sure everybody heard it. We expect NCOs for card to be up in [audio gap] (01:00:58) it's not going to be down in
Q1. And the reason for that...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A

Hey, Paul, we lost you there for a second just as you said what you were saying.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, okay. Sorry. Well, I wanted to make sure everybody heard because I thought I heard you say something
different. We expect that charge-offs per card, which obviously the primary driver of Consumer losses, we expect
those to be up in Q1 and then decline in Q2. And the uptick...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q

That's what I thought I said, so sorry about that.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Okay. And that expectation is being driven by what we see in the 90-day plus bucket in terms of delinquencies.
And those delinquencies, if you look at the other buckets, you'll see in the 90-day plus bucket, they're higher than
the other bucket. And that's the deferrals have worked their way from the 5-day, to 30-day, the 30 to 60 day.
They're now in the 90-day bucket. And we can look back historically and say X percent of our delinquencies in the
90-day bucket show up as losses in the next quarter because you get to 180 days. And so that's all we're seeing.
But importantly, when you look behind the 90-day bucket, you don't see the same elevated levels. In fact, if you
look at the 30-day bucket, you're down meaningfully year-over-year in terms of levels.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So that's why we think Q2 will have to come down. Probably maybe have to is too strong of a word. All else equal,
would you think it would come down. And the question is really, if you think about it, the people who have been
affected by this health crisis who are unemployed, who have been helped by stimulus, will this new stimulus carry
them to the point where they get vaccinated and they get jobs back? And will we ever see those losses? Or will
they just be pushed out into future periods?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So just to give you some extra information we included, if you look at page 27 of the deck and the Appendix and
the four charts at the bottom were put in specifically because this question we knew would arise. So if you look
across the buckets and you look from the mid-2019 to the end of 2020, you can see the different delinquency
buckets are all down, even the 90-plus days down a gross dollar amount year-over-year. But you can see that
what people thought was the analogy of a pig through a snake is probably more of a mouse or a snake in that it
went up. It's still a lower dollar amount, and it would come back down because you move from the left to the right
side of page.
And if you go back to page 14, you can actually see in the top chart that the total charge-offs in consumer this
quarter were $482 million. If you look at the red bars, which is the credit card, you can see that they are down
dramatically year-over-year in terms of gross dollar amounts. And then this will bode well in the future. So when
we talk about going back up, they're going up to a level that was much below where they had ever been
historically in terms of dollar amounts.
And so the last point you made just say you have it is that the unemployment rate in our customer base is below
the unemployment rate in American society and that's just due to especially on the borrowing customer base due
to the client selection and being in the prime business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Hey, Betsy, maybe just to complete the conversation with respect to Commercial, we have seen increases in
reservable criticized, but we haven't seen NPLs increase significantly. They're at 45 basis points of loans right
now. So we think commercial losses in future quarters are going to be driven by really company-specific events
19

that play out over the coming quarters and will obviously likely be concentrated in industries more heavily
impacted by COVID.
I would point out that in this quarter we took some losses as we chose to reduce exposures in industries that were
affected by COVID, and that crystallized some losses and shown up on our NCOs this quarter. If we hadn't taken
those losses, we would've hadn't sold those credits, we would've had even lower NCOs in Commercial.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Now I get it. We're forecasting NCOs peaking sometime in the end of 2021, but given your comments,
maybe the question is have they already peaked or will they have peaked for you in like 1Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A

The care there is to think the Consumer is really this point sort of run the course and the Commercial reserves
have built and the activity may occur in the out quarters but the Consumer runs, of course, by just straight
throughput 5 to 30 days, 30 to 60 days, 60 to 90 days. So we're showing you the charts that really tell you what's
going to happen in the first half and because it's a pretty mathematical calculation.

share in 2020, including in 4Q. What are you thinking about this business? What are your plans for it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, our plans are to keep running it the way we do and if you look at it year-over-year, it's an integrated
business markets. Jim does a good job. We showed you on that chart. It's up. It's one of the highest years it's
ever had, 15% or whatever it is, up year-over-year, so they do a great job. We don't play in certain areas which
run on a given quarter. Interesting enough when they don't run, people forget about that and so we have more of
a stable level of revenue.
So if you look on page 24, you'll see that $13.2 billion, $13.3 billion, $12.9 billion, $15.2 billion. So we had a good
year and the FICC was up from $8.4 billion to $9.7 billion in revenue which was substantial and some areas we
don't trade in. So we're more credit-driven and that's what drives us versus some of the competitors. We're happy
with the business. They do a great job and it's really there to help drive the connectivity between our issuing
clients and our investing clients, and we'll continue to drive it.

Can I just add one [indiscernible] (01:08:18). Happy to see what data you're looking at but I don't think we're
losing market share in FICC. I think we're actually gaining market share but perhaps not as much as we're gaining
in equities but we're gaining market share certainly in the segments where we're investing within FICC.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Paul, your growth rates have been below peer, so are you doing that by segment of business like Brian was
talking about and parsing that out between commodities and macro and credit products or is it something else?
Because certainly, if we look at year-on-year growth rates, you've been below your peers through several quarters
in 2020.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Some of the peers, but not all of the peers.

There's lots of peers in Europe.

Paul M. Donofrio A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. We'll go back and compare with the Europeans. Different question, Paul, for you. MBS premium
amortization expense, what was that this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I don't think we're giving the exact number but it was up and it did impact, I would say, meaningfully NII. From
here, we're going to need to see customer mortgage rates stabilize and go higher for that number to stabilize and
go higher. Excuse me â€“ if that one was to stabilize and go lower.

Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, but I'll give you this sense of its impact, though. If you look at the decline in net interest yield for the
company, a third of it was due to premium amortization in the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And so by the time the fourth quarter guide that you were giving us for NII to be much better, how much of a
reversal are you forecasting in that MBS premium amortization in that guide?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I would look at the forward rates to get it, for you to estimate that. We're not assuming that it goes up in that
guidance because if you look at the forward curve, rates by the end of the year are up from where they are today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah, yeah, no, I was â€“ yeah. My question was how much are you expecting it to decline, Paul? And I know
[indiscernible] (01:10:59) expected to grow.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I understand you're asking for the dollar amount, and I'm not going to give you the dollar amount.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Not the dollar amount but any sense of percentage since you said one-third of the decline came from that. Any
sense of â€“ I'm not asking for the precise dollar amount.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I'm not expecting that. But any sense?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Maybe we can follow-up? I mean, I don't have it off the top of my head. I could probably give you some sense of
how much, what percent of the improvement is from that, but I just don't have it off the top of my head. The other
thing I would point out, just to keep in mind as you're thinking about the write-off of premium is that it's not just at
this point due to the decline in rates. You have to remember that the portfolio has gotten bigger, too.

Operator: Next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Just one accounting follow-up for you, Paul. Just you mentioned the low double-digit tax
rate, and that other fee line for where the ESG investments go through has been pretty volatile, but a pretty big
negative number. And I just wanted to see if there's any way you can help us understand just what that looks like
when you're helping us understand the tax rate as the other side of it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. Sure, I can try to help you with that. I guess there's two ways to triangulate on it. Look at the other income
line for the company, okay? And with respect to modeling that line, it's going to bounce around a lot quarter-to-
quarter. But for modeling purposes, a good assumption going forward, absent unusual items, would be about a
loss of $200 million in that line, except the fourth quarter will normally be higher as it was this year, given the
seasonal increase in partnership investments that we saw this quarter.
I can give you a lot more â€“ there's lots of things in that line item, but the volatility is often driven, certainly in the
fourth quarter, by those partnership losses. Other things in that line are equity investment gains, gains and losses
on the sale of debt securities, and there's some mark-to-market income in there on our FBO loans, fair value
loans, and related hedges. So there's going to be volatility in there. I would use a loss of around $200 million per
quarter with a larger loss in the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, understood. Okay, great. And then just a follow-up just on you mentioned the progress that has been
happening in the franchise as we kind of get a little bit closer to reopening. A lot of those card and consumer-
related fee items are still kind of hanging in there plus or minus. What do we think needs to happen for those to
start moving the right way? Obviously, you've got all this excess liquidity still weighing on fees and overdrafts,
etcetera. So is this a new normal or with the economic improvement, do you expect to see also that stuff start â€“
massive fees start to improve as well?

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
The biggest line item is the interchange-type dynamics in both debit and credit, and they're growing, but they're
recovering from a deficit, as I spoke about earlier. So, yes, that should help. And then the numbers of transaction
accounts go up. But remember, we've had a strategy that is to lower a client's overdraft charges by our
SafeBalance account, which are 3 million accounts, round numbers. And we're trying to get customers to really
use our services in a way that benefits them the most, and so that works against the overdraft line as the sheer
dollar volume goes up, so we'll see. But what's really also driving us is just sheer numbers of growth in accounts
will be the driver. It'll grow slowly, though, because we have been constantly taking down â€“ we have the lowest
percentage of overdrafts as total fees in consumer of any of the large peers, and we'll continue to drive that down
because that means the customer's in good shape.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. I think it's still getting â€“ we've put the new system in and we're starting to sell it. We feel okay. We feel it's a
core part of our business. But one of the things that's held it back is that's a sales process which is more integral
to the types of people that use merchant services to be open more, and that's obviously affected by COVID. So
it's okay, but we need to improve it.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities
Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit on consumer loan growth. It seems like you deliberately shrunk
residential mortgage. Auto looked pretty good, but credit card was a little sluggish, I think, given typical
seasonality. So customers are flush with cash. How do we think about the demand for lending going forward? You
gave some nice color on the commercial side on a monthly basis. How do we think about the consumer side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, let me just â€“ the issue was if you think about being a large consumer lender, and especially you watch the
unsecured space, when March, April, May hit, you pulled in and even in the small business space. So the good
news is that we're reverting to norm. And so in December, for example, we had 198,000 booked accounts in
credit card, 191,000. That's the highest really going back to pre-COVID days, but we were running 300,000 back
then. So we've got some work to do to get it back to the full amount on the card side, for example.
24


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
In terms of mortgage, again, we were careful there, but also we're conservative on rates and we've gone to look
at that. So we booked about $7 billion in the unsecured lending side including mortgage in the core Consumer
business, and so we feel better about that. Auto picked back up, but home equity is down to $0.5 billion a quarter
or something like that when it was running $3 billion or something. So we've got some room to go.
But the good news is the card's stable, the balances are sort of stabilized at the $85 million. You have some
seasonality, but at least they stabilized there. And then, the mortgage looks like we're picking back up a bit as
we've made some adjustments and gone back to the more normalized underwriting, and auto's been strong. So
we'll see it play out, but you're right, we had to pull back and that lost about half the credit card volume on a given
month, and we're picking back up from 150.000 at the low point to 200,000, but we've got some work to do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Hi.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Brian, just to follow-up on that consumer commentary you gave, and in your prepared remarks I think you said
that you're bringing your underwriting standards back to the pre-COVID levels. Two questions, I guess, or two
parts to it. Can you give us some color of how they changed when you tightened them up, now they're back to
normal? Was it FICO scores on the consumer side? And was it also â€“ on the commercial side, did you do the
same thing? And some color around what's changed today there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So let me start with the commercial side, and this is about sort of the relationship side of the commercial
business, Business Banking, Global Commercial Banking, Global Corporate & Investment Banking. Basically in
March/April, we stopped prospecting, frankly, because it was sort of impossible to do, plus you want to make sure
you understood the portfolios. We've done quarterly portfolio reviews, every single loan going through to make
sure the ratings are right, make sure we understood where the customer stood, make sure we understood
whether they're going to need covenant waivers. That, over the course of the time here, has sorted the group of
customers which are in the industries that Paul talked about that are difficult. And the rest of the customers are
solid, in good shape, and frankly, their credit has been improving as we looked at it by quarter.
And so about four months ago, we moved into prospecting with very narrow list of prospects for Business
Banking, Commercial Banking, Big Four, , middle market and upper end of small business across our markets.
Then recently, we flipped and they can go back to full prospecting, except for limited industries that you'd expect.
In the small business side, because of the nature of the business, it was a little more dramatic. And we've opened
back up and we're getting â€“ we're up. I think in the fourth quarter, to give you a sense, we were up 50% in terms
of originations quarter-over-quarter, but we're still â€“ we're up a lot more than that, more than 50%. We're still down
50% year-over-year, up 100-plus percent in quarter to linked quarter, I think. And so new commitments up 135%,
but year-over-year still down 47%. So that shows you that's coming through and we will see that happen on the
small business side. So that was probably the slowest, because they are the most at risk, and so that's the
commercial side.
When you go to the consumer side, the reality was we basically â€“ we stayed on LTVs on the commercial â€“ on the
consumer mortgage side, we basically stopped â€“ with the FICO requirements we slowed down and do the market
dynamics. Home equity slowed down. Auto, we went back out more quickly just because of secured nature of it,
the short-term nature of it, so we felt good about that. And probably, we're always super-prime and stayed there.
But it's really â€“ what's changed in consumer in the last few months has been the move, and we're back to
probably 80%, 90% of the ability to generate that we had. We were down probably 20% and we moved back up,
and so we'll see that flow through. But it was really just until you had some clarity where this thing was going, you
had to be careful for a while. So that bodes well to economic activity and loan growth in the future.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Thank you. And then, Paul, in your comments you were talking about having greater confidence with
the deposits to go further out on the yield curve. You talked a little bit about that already. I guess the question is
26


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
what changed on the confidence side that now you're comfortable to take those deposits and move them further
out versus maybe six months ago?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Sure. So what's changed is, A, the level of deposits, right? We continue to get more and more deposits in. B,
reviewing, as Brian noted earlier, where the deposits are coming from, predominantly high-quality deposits,
checking, etcetera, new accounts. Three, when you look at just the sheer growth of the money supply coupled
with the expectation as we come out of this recession that the velocity of money will likely increase, it's hard to
build a case that we're going to see a significant decline in deposits in the US, and we're going to get our fair
share, if not more of those deposits. So because of how we run our business on both commercial and the retail
side in terms of focusing on high-quality deposits, we just feel good about the deposits we have.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. And Gerard, just to make it sort of straightforward, once you got by the feeling that this was an ephemeral
move, and especially on the corporate side that this was going to stay with you, you could be a little more
interested. In the consumer side, you always know those are going to hang. But the reality is the big inflow on the
commercial side, you had to make sure it wasn't ephemeral.

Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. I just have one question. It's regarding the reserve levels overall. I guess when you think about it, I
know there was some changes with this quarter driven, I think, by qualitative factors. But I guess when you look at
relative to the base case, how much of the reserve is still related to qualitative factors, meaning that if the base
case comes true that could be released over time?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. I don't, I'm not sure we â€“ well, I'm not sure we give the exact methodology but let me just give you a sense.
If you take our reserve setting weighting, in other words what we set the reserve by December, for year end 2020
because we set it before the statistics, the unemployment rate was 7.8% and for year end 2021 it was 6.6%, and
obviously the actual was 100 basis points-plus below that. So you would expect as you have more confidence
that the forward path is into a narrow range in the forward probability. Two things are going to happen as you go
forward. One is the sheer dollar volumes of activity has changed, and so you're dealing with less in terms of
charge-offs and things like that which gives you confidence of where the path is.
But most importantly, as you think about real reserve setting and lifetime reserves is that the economic
assumptions are clarifying, and the end of the COVID era is clarifying with the vaccine. And as we see that, you'll
see the uncertainty come down pretty quickly on the other side of that when that shows up in our assumptions. So
we weighted downside nearly 50% of the elements. That weighting will come down over time, and so when that
comes down over time you'll see the reserves releases come away from that. The second thing is as the duration
of the rest of the crisis comes in with more certainty, i.e. more people vaccinated, you also see the lifetime
calculation include the other side of the river to a bigger, bigger portion, and so that will drive it. So both those
things will change it. And as Paul said earlier, if you look at our underlying economics team, they have the
economy crossing over where it was before and growing past in terms of sheer size the end of this year, and our
reserve setting takes it into next year and things like that. So we are using a more conservative case which
implies judgment.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles W. Peabody Q
Analyst, Portales Partners
The first deals with what's going on in the regulatory front. Recently, we just had two new potential appointees,
one to the SEC and one to the CFPB. Wondering what sort of issues you thought might emerge with these
appointees. And more on the consumer side, because that's what I'm hearing where the biggest opportunity is
going to be, some of the things I'm hearing, there's going to be a crackdown on payday lending, overdraft fees,
usurious rates, artificial intelligence used in redlining. Most of those probably wouldn't affect you less than
overdraft fees. But are there anything you can think of that might affect you? And specifically, what sort of things
might affect overdraft fees?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, a decade-plus ago we started changing, before the rules were changed, our posture in overdraft fees,
realizing that a more stable customer base was vastly better for the franchise than the operating efficiency. And
so we welcome an industry which has a great consumer-oriented path to it because that's how we run our
company; we've been doing it that way for a long time. So our fees on overdrafts have been declining really as a
percentage of fees every year and probably in gross dollar amounts most years. And so we're not dependent on
those largely because of how we run the business being core customer check, 90%, plus the primary checking
28

(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
account and the household. And therefore they tend to overdraft less, and this year with the stimulus and stuff it's
even lower.
So we welcome â€“ we introduced this new loan product that basically gives a right to get an emergency loan for
$5, and that is our response to allowing our customers who have been with us for a while to access their money
for really no interest at all and use it in anticipation of paying us back quickly. These are things that we've done to
really help our retail customer segment, which is the mass market customer segment, manage their lives
effectively. And so we don't have a business built on those kind of fee structures and we're not â€“ that's why we
welcome any regulation that brings the market to us because as the most efficient and the best brand and the
best customer service, largest franchise, that's fine with us.

And my follow-up question deals with I recognize the fourth quarter on a historical basis was very, very strong.
[indiscernible] (01:30:01) trading revenues didn't [indiscernible] (01:30:07). And so my question is [indiscernible]
(01:30:10) a little more conservative in the fourth quarter we already have for the year. [indiscernible] (01:30:18)
making it more difficult [indiscernible] (01:30:22)?

Lee McEntire A

Hey, Charlie, you're really cutting out. This is Lee. You're really cutting out. I'm not sure we picked up. I think you
were asking a question about FICC and something, but we couldn't hear you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles W. Peabody Q
Analyst, Portales Partners
Yeah. Basically, the FICC trading results in the fourth quarter on a historical basis were very strong but they didn't
miss analyst estimates, not just BofA but at JPMorgan, at Citi, at Goldman, everybody. I'm trying to understand is
there something in the environment that's changing that's making it more difficult [indiscernible] (01:30:57) too
aggressive in their expectations?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
That, I don't develop those expectations. But our team had a good year and Jim and the team drove the business
well. They do it consistent with how we run the franchise, keeping the balance sheet, a third of the balance sheet
in the $35 billion of capital we have in the markets business. And for the year, we earned well above our cost of
capital and they did it. Think about the environments almost by month that we're shaped, so we feel good about it.
And so I'll let Lee follow you offline to some of the broader questions, but we don't set other people's estimates.
We only set our own.
So let me â€“ I think that was the last caller, Lee?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
Brian T. Moynihan
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Okay. Thanks. Let me finish here and let you get back to your day. 2020, let's close the book on that. It was a
strong year by the team. As we think about what we faced, a wild operating environment with work from home,
massive customer deferrals that diminished over the course of the year, massive borrowing that paid us back,
deposit inflows, government programs to implement, changes in those government programs, multiple cases of
those government programs and yet the team did a great job, so I thank the team for all the hard work they did.
We finished the year stronger than the stronger quarter of the three during the crisis. We continue to see asset
quality mitigate now, and so we feel good. We're back in the market buying back stock today. We told you we'll
buy $3 billion-plus this quarter. Our strong balance sheet and capital ratios allow us to do that. And as we also
said, NII dropped in the third quarter and we continue to push up from here. And expenses year-over-year will be
flat despite the fact we're investing heavily to have the best franchise.
So thank you for your support. We look forward to talking to you next time. Thanks.

Operator: And this will conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
