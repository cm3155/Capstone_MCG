MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the American Express Q3 2024
Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Kartik Ramachandran.
Thank you, please go ahead.

Kartik Ramachandran
Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, American Express Co.
Thank you, Donna, and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion
contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are
based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's
presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP
financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials,
as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discuss. All of these are posted on our website at
ir.americanexpress.com.
We'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's
progress and results; and then Christophe Le Caillec, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review
of our financial performance. After that, we will move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and
Christophe.
With that, let me turn it over to Steve.

Stephen J. Squeri
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Good morning, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We had another strong quarter that
reflects the steady earnings power of our business model and our continued investments for growth.
Earnings per share in the third quarter were $3.49 and revenues were $16.6 billion, up 8% over last year, marking
our 10th consecutive quarter of record revenues. Based on our performance to-date and the strong earnings
we're generating, we are raising our full-year EPS guidance to between $13.75 and $14.05, up from $13.30 to
$13.80. And we continue to expect full-year revenue growth that is within the guidance range we provided at the
beginning of the year at around 9%. I feel good about our performance to-date and the ongoing strength of our
business, and I remain confident in our long-term growth prospects.
A key reason for my confidence is the sustainability of our product refresh strategy and the growth it is generating
across our portfolio. We have already achieved our plan of refreshing 40 products globally this year, and we
expect to do several more by year-end. As we do so, we're adding value to our offerings by embedding new
benefits and services that reflect the financial and lifestyle needs of our existing premium Card Members and
attract new ones.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
A great example of this is the US Consumer Gold Card. We talk a lot about the Platinum Card and with good
reason, but the Gold Card is also a critically important product in our portfolio. Gold is a very popular product with
total US Consumer Gold acquisitions currently running at about 30% higher than Platinum, and it's our number
one premium product for Millennial and Gen Z consumers with 80% of US Gold Cards we acquire coming from
this cohort.
In designing the refresh Gold Card, which we launched in the third quarter, we know that Millennials and Gen Zs
are especially interested in dining. In fact, these younger Card Members transact almost two times more on dining
and make up a higher percentage of users on our Resy restaurant booking platform than other generations in our
Card Member base.
With that in mind, we enhanced the already-rich dining benefits that come with Gold Card membership. And as
we've done with other refreshes, the value of the additional benefits is greater than the annual fee increases.
While it's very early days, we're seeing strong new account acquisitions and continued high retention levels
among existing US Gold Card members, indicating that our customers see real value in the enhancements we've
made. This is a pattern we see when we refresh our products. We add value that resonates with premium
customers, and we price for that enhanced value, which results in strong acquisition and retention numbers that
drive spending, and consistently strong growth in subscription-like fee revenues.
The Gold Card is just one example of how dining is playing an increasingly integral role in our membership model.
Dining is an important category across our premium customer base. In fact, spending on restaurants continues to
be one of our fastest growing T&E categories in our US Consumer business, increasing 7% in Q3 versus last year
and growing at nearly twice the industry rate overall since 2019. And with total restaurant and foodservice spend
estimated at $1 trillion in the US, dining represents a significant opportunity for us to further differentiate Amex
membership.
This is why we're investing in building out our dining capabilities. First, with the acquisition of Resy in 2019, and
more recently, with the additions of Tock and Rooam, both of which have closed since we announced them in Q2.
We've made significant progress to-date. We've successfully scaled Resy since acquiring the company with over
50 million registered users; and in the last 12 months alone, the platform has seated over 350 million diners.
We're also embedding Resy benefits in several of our value propositions, including the US Gold Card I just
mentioned, as well as our US Consumer Platinum Card, and the refresh premium Delta SkyMiles co-brand cards
we announced in February.
In addition to the many benefits for Card Members, Resy strengthens our membership model in other important
ways. It connects our restaurant merchants with high spending premium customers, while also providing them
with state-of-the-art technology platform that helps them grow their businesses. Furthermore, Resy's large user
base gives us access to a pool of potential prospects who enjoy dining, but do not yet have an American Express
Card.
Our newest acquisitions will expand on the benefits we offer consumers and merchants, driving value for both.
Tock extends our dining footprint with millions of additional users and thousands more bookable venues, including
wineries, hotels and certain events in addition to restaurants. With Rooam, hospitality merchants can have access
to sophisticated integration capabilities across various restaurant management platforms and the ability to
enhance live event and stadium experiences.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
While the competition is fierce in the dining space, we believe our business model advantages, including our
premium customer base, the strong merchant relationship we have with restaurants and other hospitality
providers and our membership model position us well to continue our growth in this important category.
As we demonstrated, the investments we continue to make in our value propositions as reflected in our product
refresh strategy and in our capabilities as seen in the example of dining are fueling our momentum. And these are
just a couple of the examples of why I remain confident that our long-term growth aspirations are the right ones.
Thank you. And I'll now turn it over to Christophe for more detailed look at our performance in the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Before going into the details of our third quarter results, I'd like to
take a few minutes to step back and highlight the key takeaways from our year-to-date performance.
First, our business model is performing really well. We had another solid quarter of earnings generation with EPS
of $3.49, even as we continue to invest significantly in marketing and technology. The spend environment has
been stable over the course of the year and revenue growth is in line with our expectations with a year-to-date FX
adjusted growth of 10%.
We continue to add many more customers to the franchise. Transaction engagement is deepening and we benefit
from our diverse set of customer types, revenue streams and geographies. In addition, as Steve discussed, our
focus on continuously refreshing products is resulting in an acceleration in our card fees revenue, which grew by
18% this quarter. And our focus on premium products continues to be the foundation of our very strong credit
performance.
We continue to manage our expense base with discipline. Year-to-date, excluding the gain from Accertify,
operating expenses have grown very modestly as we fully leverage the scale and the digitization of our
operations. This business model is yielding very strong earnings, which is enabling us to increase investments to
grow the franchise and also to return excess capital to our shareholders. Compared to last year, we reduced the
number of shares outstanding by 24 million.
Turning now to our Q3 spend performance on slide 3. Billed business grew 6% on an FX adjusted basis,
continuing the trend of stable volume growth that we've been seeing over the past several quarters. And while
T&E growth rates are now more in line with what we're seeing on goods and services spending, the picture hasn't
changed very much since last quarter.
Our customers continue to deepen their engagement with their American Express Card as the number of
transactions was up 9% in Q3. This is a function of growth in the number of customers and merchants, as well as
growth in the number of transactions per customer.
For instance, transactions per customer are up around 30% from five years ago. As you look at the spend trends
by segment over the next few slides, I want to highlight a few key points to take away. Spend across our affluent
US consumer base continued to be very stable with strong growth from Millennial and Gen Z customers, up 12%.
Notably, we continued to see very strong loyalty with this younger cohort with new customer retention higher than
that of older generations.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Within commercial services, spend growth was up modestly and consistent with where we've seen over the past
few quarters. Our fastest-growing segment again this quarter is International Card Services, with spend growth of
13%. The breadth of this continued performance is especially worth noting. Every one of our five top markets is
growing in double-digits with four out of the five in mid- to high-teens. For example, Japan is up 17% and Mexico
15% on an FX adjusted basis. We also see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen Z customers in
international with the age cohort growing 23% FX adjusted in Q3.
Let me now turn to lending and credit performance on slide 7 through 9. Total loans and Card Member
receivables growth was strong at 10% year-over-year and continued to moderate as expected. Loan growth was
15% this quarter, consistent with Q2. Our enhanced lending capabilities, such as Pay Over Time, continue to be
the largest contributor to our loan growth. In addition, over 70% of revolving loan growth continues to be driven by
tenured customers.
Looking ahead, we continue to see a long runway for growth as we expand our share of lend with our premium
Card Members.
While revolve rates have largely billed back since the pandemic, we expect to see continued upward momentum
over time as we meet more of our customers' borrowing needs on our premium products and grow our charge
and co-brand portfolios. Our focus on growing lending through our premium customer base also continues to pay
off in the strength of our credit performance.
Delinquency rates remain very low and in line with our prior quarters, especially taking into account the seasonal
downtick we saw in Q2 and write-off rates declined to 1.9% this quarter. Looking forward, I still expect a modest
upward bias to these rates as we continue to acquire new customers at elevated levels and increase our share of
lending from existing customers.
This quarter, we had about $1.4 billion of provision expense. This includes a reserve bill of $264 million, which
was predominantly driven by loan volume growth. The reserve rate was 2.9% consistent with recent quarters.
Taking a step back, this best-in-class credit metrics are a reflection of our strategy. Our product value propositions
create a powerful positive selection effect, which carries through to better credit performance. Our risk
management strategies and capabilities widen the margin of safety and ensure profitable growth.
Focusing next on revenues, starting on slide 10. As I noted earlier, we grew total revenues net of interest by 8%.
Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, grew 4% versus last year and is driven by the spend trends I
discussed earlier. Net card fees increased 18% on an FX adjusted basis, accelerating 2 points sequentially driven
in part by the product refreshes, and we continue to see strong demand for our products as we bring new
customers into the franchise, with new cards acquired of 3.3 million in the quarter.
Our strong acquisition and retention levels, along with our ongoing cycle of refreshing products, continue to drive
sustainable growth in card fee revenue. This strong growth represents a real proof point of the success of our
strategy and the continued engagement of our customers.
Turning to our lending economics on slide 14. Net interest income grew 17% on an FX adjusted basis, and
continues to moderate as we previously communicated. Growth in this line is driven by increases in revolving loan
balances and net yield versus the prior.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
I'll turn now to our expense performance on slide 15. Our VCE to revenue ratio remained stable at 41% this
quarter with variable customer engagement expenses up 10% versus last year. Looking at some of the
components of VCE, rewards expense this quarter grew 10% outpacing spend growth. We are continuously
evolving the [ph] MR (00:15:28) value proposition to increase the ease of redemption for our Card Members, and
also to maintain the economics of the program.
In the short term, those changes drive a very small increase in the ultimate rate of redemption, but all the time we
are confident in the economics with minimal impact to the VCE ratio. And we continue to invest in our Card
Member benefits to deliver superior experiences for our customers. For example, this year, we've added over 300
new hotels to the Hotel Collection program, one of the benefits on the Gold Card. And we see that year-to-date
bookings on the program are 6 times higher than 5 years ago.
Marketing expense was $1.5 billion, in line with our run rate so far this year, as we continue to invest at elevated
levels versus last year. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect our full-year marketing spend for 2024 to be
around $6 billion as we lean into the attractive growth opportunities available to us.
Lastly, operating expenses of about $3.8 billion were up 5% versus last year. There is some seasonality to
operating expense levels, and we expect to see a slight uptick in Q4, consistent with prior year's trend. On a full-
year basis, we continue to expect operating expenses to remain fairly flat year-over-year, adjusting for the
Accertify gain.
Taking a step back, total expenses year-to-date are up about 5% relative to 10% growth in FX adjusted revenue.
This is a reflection of our ability to invest at elevated levels and drive strong expense leverage.
Let me now move to capital on slide 16. Our CET1 ratio was 10.7%, well within our 10% to 11% range and we
returned $2.4 billion in capital to our shareholders. This capital return included $1.9 billion of share repurchases,
the highest level in the past two years and $0.5 billion in dividends.
Also, we continue to have a very robust and diverse funding stack at our disposal. Our high-yield savings
balances grew by 19% year-over-year this quarter. Notably, over 75% of balances come from existing Card
Members, though less than 10% of our US consumer customers have a high yield savings account with us.
This brings me to our 2024 guidance. For the full year, we expect revenue growth of around 9% within the
revenue guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year. We are also raising our full-year EPS guidance
to $13.75 to $14.05, reflecting both the momentum and the earnings power of our business. This represents 23%
to 25% year-over-year growth. It is higher than we expected at the start of the year, and above our long-term
aspiration of mid-teens growth.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Kartik and we will take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning. Appreciate the solid results in what clearly is a softer spending backdrop. I guess, I'm
just thinking about the updated guidance. And as we think about that 10%-plus revenue expectation in the future,
I mean, is that possible in the current spending backdrop? Next year, as I think about it, NII will be slower. Card
fees obviously should be stronger, but does billed business have to accelerate to get to double digits, or is there
another way? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Thank, Sanjay. Look, I think that billed business definitely has to accelerate to get to our aspirational goal of 10%
revenue growth. When you think about the three legs of the stool that we have to grow our revenues, I think we
absolutely have the right balance. The balance of spending, NII, and card fees. And card fees continue to grow at
accelerated rates. It's 25 straight quarters now of double digit. We had 18% this quarter. NII continues to chug
along, but I don't think anybody wants to see us really accelerate too much from there. And I think that as we think
about our overall aspiration, that aspiration was set in a more robust environment. And so, for us to hit that 10%,
we would need to have an acceleration in billings. Certainly, an acceleration from 6%.
Having said that, and I said this about a year ago at the Goldman Sachs conference, we have driven the scale of
this business at this point to such a place that even with a softer, albeit consistently – it's been consistently soft for
the last – pretty much for the last year. If you go back, our billings overall for pretty much the last year, other than
the second quarter when we had the extra day, have been about 6% overall. But yet, we are able to deliver on our
mid-teens EPS growth. And I think that's what our focus is really on. And so, as the economy gets stronger –
when that is, I don't know, but I think it's absolutely the right aspiration for us as a company to strive for 10%
revenue growth, but we will need an acceleration in billings.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys, and Steve, thank you for the branding of our conference on the prior response. So,
maybe just a follow-up on Sanjay's question, when you think about the three legs of the stool, if we don't see an
acceleration in billings growth, can you maybe just talk about the drivers of EPS growth into 2025? Can you
continue to sustain the mid-teens growth even in the face of a challenging – of a slower-than-aspirational revenue
growth environment? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. I mean, just if you look at this year, as I just said, we've had billings growth of pretty much 6% for almost a
year now. And so, I'll just go back to my comments that I made to Sanjay. I think at the level of that 6% overall
billings growth, and we continue to acquire cards and we continue to upgrade Card Members and we continue to

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
grow NII, where we are, yeah, I think EPS growth in the range – in our mid-teens range is absolutely something
that should be expected from us.
The other thing that I would say is that while we are not – if you look at this year, we've acquired 3.4 million cards
in the first quarter and 3.3 million cards in the second quarter and 3.3 million cards in the third quarter. And that's
all about really the future for us. And as the economy gets stronger, these are cohorts and most of these people
that we're acquiring are Millennials and Gen Zs. These are cohorts that will continue to grow with us, that will see
an uptick in organic spending over time, that will wind up being upgraded from Green to a Gold, a Gold to a
Platinum and so forth.
And so once again, I think that we're really laying the foundation with the investments that we're making for strong
growth going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. Maybe I will just add one point. This year, indeed, is a good reference, right, and we're going to grow EPS
north of the mid-teens, even when you control for the Accertify gain. And that's after increasing the marketing
investments year-over-year by as much as $800 million, right? And so that speaks about the power of generating
mid-teens EPS growth despite a 6% billing growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Maurer of FT Partners. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig Maurer Q
Analyst, FT Partners
Yeah, good morning. Thanks. I wanted to ask about, business development spend came in well below what
consensus was expecting. And I was curious what is happening there, whether it was a short-term phenomenon
or something more long term. And just second, was there any impact from weather in the guide for the rest of the
year? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
I'll answer the second question and Christophe will answer the first one. No, there was no impact at all from
weather in the guide at all.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. And under business or partner payments line and business development, a lot of those expenses are about
– the agreement that we have with customers and co-brand partners in terms of sharing the economics of the co-
brands. And specifically, in terms of this quarter, the reason why that number is not growing as much as maybe
you were expecting is because, on the corporate side, we also have agreements in terms of incentives that we
pay back to our customers and since the billing is coming at a lower level, so are those incentives that we pay
back to their customers.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking my question this morning. Look, as we move into the fourth quarter, the setup is that earnings
will be way above the initial guidance and even above the second quarter increase, and revenues are gravitating
towards the low-end of your range. That suggests credit and operating leverage are better than you expected.
You've talked about the ramp in marketing, the incremental $800 million.
Historically, when earnings are – the earnings setup is this strong, you really pull forward investments, planting
seeds for long-term revenue growth. I'm curious this year why you're letting so much fall to the bottom line. Are
you starting as you ramp up that $800 million incremental? Are you starting to see the marginal return on those
investments diminish in a way that it's no longer attractive?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
No, I don't think we're seeing the marginal return. I think it's a matter of ramping – it's just ramping up to the level
that we are. I mean, when you think about how much we are – how much we are spending, on a relative basis, at
$1.5 billion – almost $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion in marketing, we're stepping up that marketing almost $800 million.
We've also stepped up technology spend. We've invested – we're investing more in control management as we
move from a Category 4 bank to a Category 3 bank.
And so we're not walking away from any investments and it's – but we're also not – Rick, what we're also not
doing is we're not lowering our standards in any way, either. So, no, I think that we've ramped up our investments
all year long. It is just really hard to then just jam a bunch more investment into next year.
Having said that, we expect that we will grow our investment levels from here as we move into 2025. I would not
expect a pullback in marketing, because as we start to look at next year, we're looking for more efficiencies,
obviously, in our marketing spend. But additionally, we're looking to invest more in marketing as we move into
next year and more in technology and so forth.
So when you think about the business from a quarter-to-quarter basis, yeah, it's easy to have that – the
assumption that you have. When you think about the business on a continuum, you have to layer in your
investments over time. So it's not as easy just to pull sort of investments in from the first quarter of next year into
the fourth quarter of this year.
Years ago, we could do that because our investment levels were probably half of where they are today. And so as
you get to that level that we are today, it is easier to go on a continuum the way we're going as opposed to, hey,
look, there's an opportunity, let's just pull it forward. So we feel good about the investment opportunities over the
next – over the medium to long range. And we'll continue to invest in the business.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. When I look at the supplement, it does seem like spend on a per-member basis has been a
little bit flatter than overall spend growth 2% versus 6%. And clearly, that's a result of your success in having so
many new customers. If we don't get to rebound in spend growth next year, and obviously, everyone is trying to
figure out whether we're going to have the soft landing or not the soft landing, how much runway do you feel you

have to continue to add new customers to keep the spend growth at the current level? And maybe as a
compound question to that, maybe give us some color on where we are on the product refresh cycle.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So let me answer the second part and go to the first. I think on the product refresh cycle, we've already –
we're at our 40 that we had committed to at the beginning of the year. And there will be some more refreshes that
will be done over the rest of this year. And we will continue refreshing on next year.
I'll let Christophe comment a little bit, but I'll just give you a couple of other points as it relates to your first
question. We still see line of sight as we move into next year to acquire more cardholders. I think when you look
at the overall spending, organic spending in our customer base is not as robust as it was in a more robust
environment. And that's what our cardholders do.
What our cardholders will do is pull back slightly if they lose any confidence, see any sort of signs of their own
stress, but they will continue to pay their bills. And that's why our credit numbers are so good. I think when you
look at the organic piece of this, you see this especially within our small business.
Our small business has been hit from a macro perspective – I think just like a lot of other companies' small
business in that the organic spend was the same-store sales spend that is occurring on the card in small
businesses is certainly not as robust as it was coming out of the pandemic. In fact, it is negative because when
you look at our small business, our acquisition is good and our retention is really good. It is that organic spend
that's down. And so that organic spend leads to a slight depression in spend per Card Member.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. And so to adapt to the other part of your question, the metric you're looking at is an average, is a global
average, so that adds up. Customers in Australia and Japan as well as in the US. So it's hard to read a lot of
insights out of that metric. So to give you a bit more color on how to think about those new Card Members that are
joining the franchise, we do see that they are more engaged than the past vintages, if you want.
But when we look at the number of transaction per new Card Member, that number is trending up. In my prepared
remarks, I cited the metric of 30% more transaction per new Card Member now than five years ago, and we see
that, right? And this is a function of better coverage, not only in the US but also outside of the US. And we stick to
the premiumness of our acquisition.
Not only we grew the number of Card Member, as you pointed out, but we are maintaining the fact that about
60% of them are coming up on a fee-paying product. So they are very engaged. And so each vintage, if you want,
is definitely showing progress. And what's impacting this average are the things that Steve talked about and that
the tenured Card Members and what we call the organic spend that is a little bit more challenged.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Steve, the general consensus pretty much among everyone is that the affluent US consumer is in good shape. I
just wanted to get your sense if you're seeing anything in your data bookings that would raise concern around the
sustainability of that, you've got an election coming up and things of that nature.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
No, I mean, look, this company has been around a long time. I mean, obviously, we didn't have cards 174 years
ago, but we've been around for lots of different elections, lots of different configurations of the House, the Senate,
and so forth.
Our customer base is very different than our competitors' customer base. And it's really resilient and pretty stable.
I think that they're continuing to spend, albeit at not levels that we saw coming out of the pandemic but the US
consumer – just to pick the US consumer has been really stable. I mean, it's been just about 6% for the last few
quarters. And if you look at the international consumer, and a lot of people forget, we do have the international
side of our business, international consumer business has been growing 13% for the last four quarters as well.
So we're not seeing anything that would indicate that spending would go down. And we're not seeing anything
that would indicate our credit metrics are getting any worse. In fact, you saw write-offs go sequentially down, and
so we feel good about the consumer.
We would like to see more organic spend. And I think to go back to the beginning when Sanjay opened us up with
that question, I think an uptick in that organic spend will help us reach our overall aspiration of 10%. But that's
why our aspiration of 10% is, in fact, an aspiration and I think still the right aspiration for this company, because
we do expect organic to come back. Organic will not stay at this level forever. When that comes back? I don't
know. But regardless, and as we've proven this year, we're able to still deliver that mid-teens EPS growth.

Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, just if we look at the approximately 9% revenue
growth for the year, as you sit here only 18 days into the quarter, does that suggest that you're maybe looking for
a little bit of a revenue growth reacceleration in the fourth quarter here? Or how are you thinking about that 9% for
the year? Could it maybe slip a little bit below that?
And when we look at the discount revenue growth, it did go under the billed business growth a little bit this
quarter. I think the implied discount rate did drop a little bit. Is there any noise in there? Or is there something we
should be aware of there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
So, I'll take the second part of your question first in terms of how to think about the discount revenue versus the
billed business. As Steve just mentioned, international is growing at a faster clip than the US. And as you
probably know, the discount rate in international is lower than the US. So, that creates a little bit of a disconnect
between the growth you see in discount revenue and on billed business globally.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
As far as the first part of your question in terms of how to think about revenue growth and how to think about Q4,
the best way to – the keyword that we've been using this morning is stability. We see stability in terms of billings,
in terms of the trends, and no inflection point. So as you said, we are only like a few weeks into Q4, but my
projection for Q4 is to be a continuation of a lot of these trends. So, Q3 is a good proxy for what to expect about
Q4. And that's why we're guiding towards 9% revenue growth.
I want to point out, though, that the EPS in terms of full-year performance is also way north of what we guided
towards at the beginning of the year, even when you adjust for Accertify. So, we're generating a lot of earnings
even with being at 9% revenue growth, which still – when I listen to peers, it compares really well to most of our
peers.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristopher Kennedy Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, you mentioned how customers generally move from Green
Cards to Gold Cards to Platinum Cards. Is there any way to think about the lifetime value or average spend by
category? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
I think when you start to move up the food chain, you move up because you're going to – for example, you're
moving from – if you're a Millennial, for example, and you're on a Gold Card, you're probably not traveling as
much, but you're dining out a lot, and you're maybe just starting with the franchise. As you start to move along,
you might have a little bit more discretionary income, you're traveling more, you're taking advantage of lounges,
you're taking advantage of fine hotels and resorts and hotels.
And so, you will see higher spending on Platinum Cards than you will on Gold Cards and on Green Cards,
because if you're going to pay a higher fee for a product, you're going to engage in that product more. You're
going to use that product for what the benefits of that product in fact is. And when you think about it, the Platinum
Card, while it's morphing into much more of a lifestyle card overall, still has heavy travel benefits to it.
And to really take full advantage of that, you want to be traveling. And airline tickets cost money and hotels cost
money and so forth. So, I think as people do move along the continuum, you do have a higher lifetime value
depending upon when you enter the franchise, right?
So if you enter the franchise at a Gold Card level and ultimately upgrade to a Platinum, yes, you will have a higher
lifetime value overall to us. If you enter as a Gen Xer or a boomer into the Platinum franchise, which we still
acquire Gen Xers and boomers, obviously, you probably have a lower lifetime value than you would as a
Millennial who entered in as a Gold Card member. So, it all depends on the entry point. But in general, as they
move up, we get more value out of them.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Hey. Good morning. I wanted to ask about how to think about net interest income dynamics as we head into 2025
and just what the building blocks are. Steve, I think you mentioned that you don't want to accelerate too much
from here. But if you could just – Christophe, if you could just give us some of the building blocks in terms of how
to think about NII in this rate environment, your liability-sensitive deposit dynamics, revolve rates, balances, stuff
like that, if you could just kind of help us think through how to think about the evolution as we head out into 2025.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
So the first thing maybe is to remind ourselves that we are slightly liability-sensitive, but only very slightly and the
impact of Fed funds rate cuts on our NII is actually quite small. And we regularly update this sensitivity in our 10-
Q, and you'll see later this afternoon we updated those numbers as well. They're really small. And so maybe we
can put this one out of the equation.
The rest is a volume rate balance. So from a volume standpoint, we have said that you should expect the volume,
the AR, especially the revolving balances to moderate in terms of growth. And the dynamic, and we're all familiar
with it, right, during the pandemic, people paid back the balances and have been rebuilding slowly their balances.
And the revolve rates that we're seeing now are starting to stabilize and moderate. So I think we are – I would
say, this normalization is – for the most part, is behind us. And so you expect now the growth rate to very much
moderate.
And from a yield standpoint, there are two things here, right? The first one is, we keep shifting the funding of
those balances towards high-yield savings accounts, which is the lowest funding cost for us. And so this creates a
positive impact, a positive effect on the yield. And on the interest income, we keep working in terms of making
sure we have the right price points. We constantly compare our price as well against our peers, and we make
sure that we are well-positioned there.
And so we should expect the yield to benefit from this dynamic. But the way to think about it is moderation in
terms of volume. We're going to maintain the strong yield that you see now, and very, very limited impact from
any change in the rate environment from a Fed fund rate standpoint.

Terry Ma Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So your card acquisitions continue to run at a pretty healthy level, and your net
card fee growth this quarter has already exceeded the exit rate of last year. I guess, are you running ahead of
your expectations for some of these product refreshes in terms of adoption or engagement in general?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. I think it's what we've really expected from an adoption and engagement perspective. As I said, there will
be a few more product refreshes. This is where we pretty much expected the overall growth rate to be. A little bit –
obviously, higher than when we entered the year because that's what happens, right?
People get attracted. I think, they get attracted to the products. I think one of the things that – we've said this
before, but I think it's worth repeating. When you refresh the product, what it does, it creates more demand in the

marketplace, and it helps your marketing dollars work even harder for you. And so when you look at how that
category of revenue grows, early on, those categories are from new cardholders.
And remember, we amortize that over a 12-month period, and not everybody gets repriced all at once. So it does
build in for us a ramping-up effect of that overall category. So not only is it important to upgrade these products,
because it enables you to attract new cardholders, but it enables you to continue to engage with your existing
cardholders. But it does add to that, obviously, that overall subscription-like and SaaS-like revenues that card fee
subscriptions are. And we're over $2 billion in this particular quarter.
So we continue to focus on that, because what we know is our fee-paying Card Members are our most engaged
cardholders that we have, because they – we want them to use the benefits and services.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mark DeVries of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark DeVries Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you. I have a related question to the impact of Fed easing on your business. Have you looked at
kind of what the impact is from Fed easing and the effort to stimulate the economy on your billed business
growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christophe Le Caillec A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
So this is a good point. So at this point in time, the reduction is too small. It's too early to see any impact in terms
of the spend patterns. And we looked into it but there's like nothing visible, as you would expect, probably too
small. But the expectation is that consumer and small business confidence is going to improve as a result of the
rate environment being more supportive.
Because as we said this morning, right, we see no evidence of stress in terms of credit. We see demand in terms
of our premium products. We see very strong renewal rates, even when Card Members are moving to a higher
price point. So there's definitely capacity to spend, to spend more. And my expectation is that the accumulation of
cuts will provide some support for the consumer and small business confidence, and that will provide some
support to billing. And to go back to the first question we addressed this morning, especially to that organic
growth, that would benefit from that.

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Wanted to turn to T&E spend for a second, and just a
two-part question on that. The first is just on airline spend. I think it accelerated this quarter. Can you just talk
about the drivers there? Was it corporate, consumer, both, what you saw there?
And then, just on restaurant spending. I think it deceled a little bit this quarter, but just going back to the opening
remarks, Steve, you referenced just the investments you're making in that category between Resy and Tock, and
just adding those benefits to various cards. Do you expect restaurant spending as a category to become a bigger
part of your business and grow? Like, should we expect acceleration in that spending from here? Thanks.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So let me talk about restaurant spending. So when you look at before we made our foray into sort of the
restaurant reservation business here with Resy, restaurant spending was not our biggest T&E category. Our
biggest T&E category and still our fastest-growing T&E category right now is restaurants. And our expectations
are that we will continue to gain share in that restaurant space.
If you look at it, we've – just over the last five years, we've grown twice what the industry growth rate has been
from a restaurant perspective. Yeah, there's a little bit of a decel this quarter, but I guess 8% to 7% but I'm not
really all that concerned about that. And I think with our Tock acquisition and so forth, I think we will continue to
punch above our weight from a restaurant perspective.
I'll just give you a high level on airline. I don't think there's really a lot of change whether it's from a corporate
perspective, or a consumer perspective from airline. I mean, you went from 5% to 6%. I mean, that's not – in
some cases, it can just be a little rounding up or a little rounding down quarter-to-quarter. But airline is still strong.
And as we said, we saw international bookings – I mean, I didn't say this, but we saw international bookings in the
third quarter from our travel business actually be at the highest levels since before the pandemic.
So our Card Members are still looking to travel. They're looking at – when you're traveling internationally, you tend
to spend a little bit more than when you're traveling domestically. So I don't think there's much to read into the
airline piece of it or the restaurant piece other than restaurant is still a very, very strong category for us. But the 1
point up and 1 point down, I wouldn't make too much about for this particular quarter.
But I think that from a restaurant perspective, we obviously are doubling-down on restaurant, not only from the
perspective of what we've done with the Tock and Rooam acquisition, but just look at the Gold Card refresh,
which is a heavy dining product, and it's targeted at a cohort Millennial and Gen Zs that spend more in dining than
any other cohort that we have. So we're pretty bullish on the restaurant industry.
