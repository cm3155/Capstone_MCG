industry. Valley encourages all participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-Q
and 10-K for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements and the factors that could cause actual results
to differ from those statements.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ira Robbins
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Travis, and welcome to those of you on the call. This morning, I will discuss [ph] Valley's response
(00:01:53) to recent events and then we have time to provide insight on the quarter's loan and Deposit results.
Mike will then discussed the financial results in more detail.
In the first quarter of 2023, Valley reported net income of $147 million. Earnings per share of $0.28. And an
annualized ROA of 0.98% exclusive of non-core items. Adjusted net income, EPS and ROA were $155 million
$0.30 and $1.03 respectively.
This quarter's financial performance was negatively impacted by seasonal factors related to net interest income
and operating expenses. Net interest margin compression partially related to our conserve liquidity and other
operating leverage headwinds. That said, I am extremely proud of the strength exhibited by our balance sheet in
this recent period of stress. To be clear, we entered the turmoil from a position of balance sheet and capital
strength. Our extremely diverse and granular deposit base contributed to our structurally low uninsured deposit
balances and supported our funding stability during the quarter.
Our business niches and geographic footprint have positioned as well to benefit from recent disruption. In the last
three weeks of March, we opened over 7,000 new deposit accounts, which represented a full quarter's worth of
account acquisitions in normal times. These accounts continue to fund a new customer flows remain strong.
From a capital perspective, we continue to benefit from our modest securities portfolio and associated OCI
impact. These characteristics, as well as our strong underwriting track record, have clearly differentiated value
during this period of stress. As always, during the recent bank failure crisis, our teams were proactive, consistent
and direct in their client communications. This high touch approach further differentiates our organization and is
indicative of the premier service oriented [audio gap] (00:03:54-00:03:56). We are also set apart as one of the top
risk managers in the entire banking space.
External stakeholders tend to focus on our track record of strong credit quality. But we are equally proud of the
other components of our Enterprise Risk culture. For example, our interest rate risk and liquidity risk management
positively differentiated value during the crisis.
As a result of our strong risk management approach and confidence in our balance sheet, we were able to bid on
the former Silicon Valley Bank. We structure a sophisticated and thoughtful proposal that was strategically and
financially compelling for Valley. While our disciplined bid came up just short in the end, we are prepared and
positioned to explore future opportunities that may emerge. Valley fills the void in the current banking landscape
today, as there are only a handful of commercial banks our size the entire country. The niche of client we serve is
strong and our opportunities will only expand exponentially as the banking industry further evolves.
Over the last 95 years, our organization has successfully navigated a variety of diverse crises. While we remain
competent in our risk management approach, strategic vision and collective path forward, we are laser focused on
diversity and granularity on both sides of the balance sheet and will not sacrifice the high credit standards, which

has set us apart throughout our history. We continue to provide industry leading service and expertise to assist
our clients and communities in achieving their financial goals. We believe that this long-term approach will drive
shareholder value over time.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom and Mike to discuss the quarter's growth and financial results.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza
President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Ira. Slide five illustrates our stable deposit balances for the quarter. We are very pleased with the
performance of our deposit base over the last few months. Precious experience following the closures of Silicon
Valley and Signature were generally contain to a few larger corporate relationships, which we have been actively
managing as rates increased. Our technology banking business performed extremely well during the crisis and
experienced only a modest decline in total balances. This team contributed to a significant amount of the new
account openings that Ira mentioned earlier.
The combination of runoff and lower cost customer balances and the continued utilization of higher cost fully FDIC
insured indirect deposits drove costs higher during the quarter. In general, [ph] data has (00:06:30) remained in
line with our projected path for the year.
Slide 6 highlights the diversity of our deposit portfolio. Roughly two thirds of our deposits come from our stable
branch network. Just less than 20% of our deposits are from specialized verticals like our online channel,
international and technology, private banking and cannabis segments. The diversity of available sources of
funding continues to provide significant opportunity for Valley to capitalize on disruption across the industry. Our
uninsured deposit exposure compares favorably to peers, and we continue to utilize a variety of tools to reduce
this further. Most importantly, our robust cash and available liquidity provides significant coverage in excess of our
uninsured balances.
Slide 7 further illustrates diversity and granularity of our deposit base. Our commercial deposits are spread across
our extensive geographic footprint and a variety of industries. This diversity has been critical in defending our
deposit base and should continue to provide discrete growth opportunities going forward.
You can also see some statistics on the depth and breadth of our client base. We have over 600,000 deposit
customers with an average tenure beyond 10 years. Our granular deposit base has an average account size of
below $60,000.
Turning to the loan portfolio on slide 8, you can see an overview of the portfolio's growth and composition. While
quarterly originations continue to decline, net loan growth remains elevated as payoff activity is depressed. Our
portfolio is extremely diverse across geographies and asset classes, and both origination and portfolio yields
continue to increase.
Slide 9 illustrates diversity of our commercial real estate portfolio by collateral type and geography. As a reminder,
we have an extremely granular loan portfolio with an average loan size of roughly $5 million. From a metric
perspective, our weighted average loan to value is 58%, and our weighted average debt service coverage is
approximately 1.8 times. We believe these metrics compare favorably to peers as we have consistently and
conservatively underwritten to higher cap rates. Our experience with recent refinancing activity has been positive
given the existing cushion we had baked into past underwriting.

Slide 10 provides additional detail on a modest and granular office portfolio. Our office portfolio, including
healthcare office, comprises a modest 11% of commercial real estate. This includes approximately [ph] $600
million (00:09:50) of owner occupied office.
Our portfolio is geographically diverse, with only immaterial exposure to Manhattan. The credit metrics on this
portfolio are extremely strong and we have not experienced any losses in our recent history. Important, the
portfolio is largely multi-tenant with a very small average loan size of $2.2 million. We understand the concerns
over office collateral in general, but believe our portfolio is positioned to perform well. We have utilized Slide 11 at
various times in the past. We believe this illustrates the ultimate manifestation of our strong and consistent credit
culture in both ordinary times and in periods of stress Valley's credit losses have been well below industry levels.
We anticipate this will continue going forward.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn to provide additional insight on the quarter's financials.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Tom. Slide 12 illustrates Valley's recent quarterly net interest income and margin trends. Net interest
income declined approximately $30 million from the linked quarter. We estimate that $8.5 million of the reduction
was related to the combined impact of the lower day count in the quarter and the drag of excess liquidity added in
March. The remaining pressure is the result of continued deposit mix shift into higher cost products and
increasing deposit costs reflecting competitive dynamics. Our fully tax equivalent net interest margin declined 41
basis points to 3.16% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Approximately 16 basis points of the sequential reduction
was associated with day count and the drag of excess liquidity in March.
Remaining compression is largely the result of higher costs associated with incremental funding. As you saw on
Slide 5, cumulative deposit beta increased to 41% in the quarter from 34% in the fourth quarter. While asset
yields are expected to reprice higher, the funding cost dynamic will likely result in net interest margin continuing to
decline throughout the year absent the impacts of day count and excess liquidity. We anticipate that our 2023
non-interest income growth will now be closer to 10% to 12% from the 16% to 18% range provided previously.
Moving to Slide 13. We generated $54.3 million of non-interest income for the quarter as compared to $52.8
million in the fourth quarter. This sequential growth was primarily the result of higher capital markets, revenue and
other income, which offset seasonally lower income from wealth, trust and insurance.
On Slide 14, you can see that our noninterest expenses were approximately $272 million for the quarter, or
approximately $264 million on an adjusted basis. The increase in adjusted expenses from the fourth quarter were
largely related to seasonally elevated payroll taxes, expenses and the higher FDIC assessment. Expenses in
other categories were well controlled and declined modestly from the fourth quarter. As a result of seasonal
factors associated with day count and elevated payroll taxes our first quarter efficiency ratio traditionally
represents the high watermark for the year. We're not currently revising our guided growth rate for non-interest
expenses. However, our revised net interest income growth guidance will negatively impact our efficiency ratio
expectations. While efficiency will improve throughout the year, we believe a full year estimate around 50% is
more reasonable.
Turning to slide 15, you can see our asset quality trends for the last five quarters. The first quarter's 2023,
elevated net charge offs were the result of the further write-down of a C&I loan discussed last quarter and a single
development project. These credits were each substantially reserved for and proactively addressed. Underlying
credit metrics remained strong. Our allowance for credit losses declined to 0.95% of loans from 1.03% in the

fourth quarter. The sequential decline was largely the result of substantial pre-existing specific reserves
associated with the quarter's charge-offs.
As a reminder, our allowance coverage ratio of 0.95% is still higher than our day one CECL ratio of 0.89%. As a
percent of non-accrual loans, the allowance for loan losses increased to 181% at March 31, 2023, from 170% at
December 31, 2022.
In response to recent environmental turmoil, we added disclosure around our securities portfolio on page 16. In
aggregate securities represent a modest 8% of our total assets. Our portfolio is conservatively managed for
ongoing liquidity and is not a profitability tool.
On slide 17, you can see that tangible book value increased approximately 2.6% for the quarter. This was the
result of our retained earnings and a modest improvement in the OCI impact associated with our available for sale
securities portfolio. Tangible common equity to tangible assets declined to 6.82% during the quarter. The
sequential reduction is primarily a result of excess liquidity held at March 31. If our cash position had remained
stable on December 31, 2022, our tangible common equity ratio would have been approximately 7.38%. Our risk-
based capital ratios were relatively stable during the quarter. As you can see given our modest securities portfolio,
OCI would only have a minor impact on our regulatory ratios, all else equal.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

Maybe just starting off – maybe just starting off with loan growth here. You saw strong loan growth in the quarter.
Just kind of curious as to how you think about the dynamics there and loan pricing as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Hey, Steve. It's Tom Iadanza. As you saw, we had a 50% annualized growth. I just want to point out how
balanced, diverse and granular was. We're still averaging below $10 million in our CRE portfolio originations and
about $1 million on our C&I originations. It's balanced by region, it's balanced by type, it's balanced in a very

diverse way, by size and such as I've mentioned. We previously gave a range of 7% to 9% for the year. We think
we'll be at the high end or slightly above that range at the end of 2023.
We have a very strong customer base, very loyal customer base, 70% of our business comes from that customer
base. It's relationship driven. It's priced in a relationship way. We are opportunistically raising spreads wherever
we can across the board.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And so in terms of raising spreads, just kind of curious, if you're raising spreads relative to whatever index,
how are you guys thinking about that? It seems still pretty tight, marginal funding costs around 5% these days? Or
just kind of any help you can give with that dynamic?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, sure. Keep in mind, with the diversity of the types of loans we do, this spreads will vary. We have a very
active profitability model, which we use. Again, it's relationship driven. The spreads will vary based on the risk and
type of loan, so it's really hard to give you a figure on that spread. But I will tell you, on average, spreads have
probably gone up over 50 basis points.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one for me on credit. You did have an increase in delinquencies here in
C&I and CRE in the 30 day, 90 day bucket. Kind of curious, you'd give some color around those projects. And, if –
how you guys are, think about reserve ratio going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, Steve. I think you're referring to the performing non accruals or performing accruals there. That bucket
slightly ticked up, our non-accruals went down to 50 basis points from 57. That performing accrual was slightly up,
but that's a function of one customer that's fully secured by cash surrender value of life insurance at about $21
million. You take that out. That bucket also declined. That's the process of getting [indiscernible] (00:19:41).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate all the call here and I'll step back. Thanks.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2023
Frank, can you hear us?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Can you talk a little bit about the opportunity to fund that growth? Talk about, you know where your brokered
balances are now on the deposit side. It seems like broker seems like a reasonable alternative in this environment
for funding. But, are you limited in the room there in terms of bringing that higher or how do you think about
funding in general here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Maybe let me start just with, I think how we think about funding overall and then I think Tom obviously you'll speak
to some of obviously the demands from a loan growth perspective on what that is. But yeah I think we're probably
incorrect to think every incremental dollar of funding cost comes in here at 5%. During the quarter, we raised over
$600 million. What I would deem is core funding nonspecific broker and the cost of that was a blended 2.50% and
we had a very strong funding vehicle across the entire organization based on the diversity and granularity that we
have.
When you think about some of the incremental funding costs, obviously a lot of that's attributable to the 14.7%
annualized loan growth that obviously impacts the data and as Tom referenced. We anticipate that lease declining
a little bit, which will definitely impact the plug that we need when it comes to some of the wholesale funding in the
environment today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Just to add to that, Frank, as I mentioned, 70% of our new business comes from our existing customer base. We
have consistently supported them in all economic cycles at all times. We will continue to do that. We are
experiencing a decline in our originations as you've seen on probably slide 8 if I recall. But more importantly, our
pipeline of approved to be closed loans is down 30% since Q4. So we are seeing that reduction in loan demand.
And as part of that, our customers are choosing not to move forward on projects and reducing that pull through
our work in process piece. Yeah. And one other component, when you look at the deposit side, if you go back
three years, we didn't have the ditches and deposits, or verticals that we have today. So there's $8.5 billion of
deposits that came from some of those specialty programs that we referenced in that slide.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Right. Okay. So in terms of the some of the verticals you mentioned, the technology deposits, which still, I guess
a relatively small piece of the overall pie. I think, Tom, you said they were down modestly, but you also talked
about opportunity on that side. So are those – and account openings. So I wonder if you could just talk about the
opportunities specifically with a couple of names that have, the signatures of the world, the Silicon Valley, the
opportunity there in the near-term to drive both loan and deposit growth. And then specifically on the technology
side, are those deposit balances now actually up from where they were? Or can you give a little bit more
clarification there?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2023
Hi, Frank. And I think it's something we've been focused on. Having a diverse [ph] granular (00:23:26) deposit
base that we have is something we've been commenting on and driving across the entire organization for the last
five-ish years. As Tom mentioned, that $8.5 billion that we're referencing on slide 6, zero of that existed five years
ago. Right. The average cost of that is 2.17% today. So I think we've done a very good job of being able to
originate alternate deposit growth based on different initiatives that we've initiated over the last few years, which I
think is now coming to fruition.
And I think one of the things that you don't see here though is some of the off balance sheet platforms that we've
been able to create as well. We had about $1 billion, $1.9 billion move from our balance sheet into treasury
accounts still on our platform since October 1st of last year.
Now historically, those would have been deposits that would have left the balance sheet. At some point as the
inverted curve begins to change, there's obviously an expectation that those will rotate back into deposits on to
the bank. So we feel really good about the position we've been. All the work we've done over the last five years in
creating not just diversity from an on-balance sheet perspective, but diversity from an off-balance sheet
perspective.
Those deposits that you see on slide 6, $8.5 billion, there is still significant opportunity for continued growth in
that. And I think during the quarter, we saw about 15% growth in the cannabis business and we continue to see
expansion of technology accounts across the entire platform.
The technology bucket is a little bit interesting. There's obviously some chunkier deposits in there. And some of
those deposits ebb and flow based on unique activities within those individual clients. One of the clients, a very
large percentage of that actually went public. And as a result of that, we lost some of those deposits during the
quarter. So it is a very, very sticky deposit base. Over 60% of the technology deposits are noninterest-bearing,
here at Valley, which I think is different from a lot of other organizations as well. So we are really excited about the
continued opportunities for growth in these segments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just lastly just point of clarification from the deck. When you guys mentioned on the page 6 – slide
6, the 31% uninsured deposit number, is that inclusive of the fully collateralized deposits? Are those in that
uninsured number that 4.6%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning David.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Good morning. The earnings release notes that some of the short term funding that you guys added during the
quarter has rolled off. Just curious how much has already been paid down or redeemed since the quarter end?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
This is Mike. As you can see from the earnings release, at the peak, I'm talking about from [ph] 3/9 to 3/31
(00:26:40), at the peak during that time, it was in excess of $6 billion. And as we sit today, our cash and cash
equivalents at the Federal Reserve or any other cash balance is at $1.5 billion. So it is remarkably come down.
And just to be clear about this, this was done specifically for an abundance of caution given the environment that
existed post March 9.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got it. And then in terms of the disclosures regarding the deposits, curious, did a lot of customers take advantage
of sort of the [indiscernible] (00:27:20) system, just curious what you saw in terms of flows there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So prior to March 9, we had just a little over $200 million in that program. Whether that be reciprocal or one
ways. The reciprocal balance as we sit today is $1.4 billion. And if you put the one-ways in there, it's $1.6 billion.
So there has been usage, but I would say probably not as much as you would think. Once again, it goes back to
Ira's comments about the resiliency and the opportunities that we have in those various verticals to make that
difference up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, David, it's Tom again. Just as a point of reference, an example, we were proactive in discussing a variety of
verticals to ensure customer deposits and I will – some of our very largest commercial deposit customers chose
not to, [ph] based on the (00:28:10) confidence and faith in Valley.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got it. And then one final question, I think you noted in the preamble, payoffs were down to zero this quarter. Just
curious what they were this quarter versus the last. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, I don't – they've been pretty consistent these last few quarters, keeping in mind that the higher interest
rates really knocked out any type of refinance business. So they really haven't deviated in the last two or three
quarters.

I wanted to follow up on the last question where you mentioned that cash balances are back down to $1.5 billion
or so. Based on that, I guess, how should we think about the NIM trajectory embedded within your guidance? So
you noted that 16 basis points of the decline in NIM was related to day count and excess liquidity. So is a good
starting point for the second quarter, about 3.30% or so in NIM? And then how should we think about the decline
in NIM that you saw last quarter, the core decline of about 25 basis points. Should we expect that to slow as we
go through the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
This is Mike. I'll take the first stab at this. First, I want to point out that the $1.5 billion that we have in excess
liquidity on the balance sheet, as we sit today, I think the bias clearly for that will be for that to go lower as we see
the crisis, at least the immediate impact of the crisis abate. In my prepared remarks, as you rightly pointed out,
the 16 basis points against the margin would put it at 3.32% for the quarter. But I think it's important, as you look
forward, March liquidity adjusted margin was only 3.25%. So we're already starting to see some of that
compression.
And essentially, that compression is coming from two places. One, a continued rotation out of non-interest-
bearing into interest-bearing accounts. As Tom alluded to, and Ira both, our mix of clients tend to be savvy at very
liquid customers, and so they can take advantage of the fact that they don't need to hold as much in non-interest-
bearing.
And then the second reason is the inverted curve is causing increased deposit competition, especially on the
short end of the curve, and also we're competing against government securities with our clients as well, some of
the more savvy ones are moving into treasuries. The good news on that side is they're still staying within the

Valley family to do that. So in a different interest rate environment, we expect some of those deposits or those
securities to rotate back into deposits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. As you think about the mix of NIB, NIB deposit balances, how should we think about that going into year
end?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Right now we expect the trough, I can't tell you what quarter I think it's going to happen in, but we expect
the trough to be somewhere in the mid-20s. So we do expect continued rotation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And maybe just a quick follow-up there in terms of the maturity of CDs on your books, I recall that you were
putting on longer dated CDs a while back. How should we think about the maturities coming up over the next
couple of quarters or so?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
No, we have actually not been putting on at least in the last year, longer dated CDs. We've been actually – we put
some specials on in 2022 that were roughly 18 months at the high end. And you'll see all of that come due in the
latter half of this year, early 2024.

Thank you, I'm on Mike Perito. Could you talk about your various deposit niches, you have a very good pie in all
of that, and across the various industries and categories you have. And which ones, you think could be the
strongest over the rest of the year and possibly as we enter into 2024?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2023
Thanks. And I think obviously, even there, we mentioned a bunch of them, and that diversity is really important to
us. So it's not just specialized niches that are focused on one individual slide or on individual pie, excuse me, but
it's a lot of individual pie there that really comprise that. As we think about the technology slide just in itself with a
pie there, obviously, there's been a significant amount of disruption in the industry associate with that. We opened
up over 7,000 accounts in the last three weeks of the first quarter. Another metric is we opened up 4,500 business
accounts in the fourth quarter, [indiscernible] (00:33:38) in the first quarter of 2023. And that's equal to what we
would have done in six months back in 2022. So there's been a significant amount of activity across the entire
footprint of Valley. And I think there's an opportunity to continue to expand some of the specialized [ph] beta
(00:33:52).
When we were able to grow $600 million of deposits in the first quarter at a blended rate of [ph] 2.50% (00:33:58),
it does reflect the overall diversity. I think the funding cost on an incremental blend basis will come down a little
bit, as we think about slowing loan growth. So I think a 41% deposit beta on a cumulative basis where we are
today, based on having loan growth at the levels we have really reflect a lot of organic deposit growth. That's a
little bit hard to see when we try to sort of measure it versus a lot of our peers that haven't really generated the
same type of loan growth that we have. So we do believe that that beta will continue to perform, and we'll
probably improve on a relative basis as the loan growth really subsides a little bit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tim Switzer Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And on the loan growth, my guess is [ph] now (00:34:43), just given you're still kind of maintaining guidance
there, but have you heard from customers any signs of slowing investment or loan demand, just out there with the
uncertainty. I'm wondering if people are starting to become a little bit more cautious, what your discussions are
like.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. As we mentioned earlier, customers have certainly slowed down in their desire to start projects. They're
going to wait to see what happens to the interest rate market over the next 12 to 24 months. That's what's created
that 30% reduction in our to be closed bucket of our pipeline. A lot of it is self-induced by the customer base, more
so than it is by us. Customers, we're not seeing any deterioration in credit quality. What we are seeing is just a
wait and see by the customers.

Ira D. Robbins A

Yes, we have – again, we have a very conservative underwriting standards to begin with. But we look to tighten,
especially in certain buckets of our portfolio. So we consistently do that throughout every cycle.

Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Breese with Stephens. Matthew, go ahead with your
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good morning, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning, Matt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I know in past quarters, we've discussed the outlook for deposit betas through cycle and in the past, you provided
somewhat of a range. At this stage, is it safe to say that the cumulative deposit beta will end up being closer to
the higher end, 40% to 50%? Is that kind of how you see this all playing out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, this is Mike. We clearly think that through the cycle, cumulative deposit beta will be around 50%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Well, one of the things I think, Matt, is obviously, we've been in banking for a long time, just like what you've seen,
you go back to sort of pass environment, you've seen what happens. But obviously, betas in different
environments are really a function of what the alternative external variables are as well. And right now, we're in an
inverted curve. That inverter curve obviously [ph] going to (00:37:18) pressure betas until the inversion changes.
So as Mike mentioned, Travis mentioned, and I'm sure a lot of others are seeing today, most of our competition

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2023
today isn't peer banks that are sitting around the corner. Most of the competition sits in the treasury yields today
based on where they are. So that deposit beta is going to stay elevated, I believe, as long as we're in this inverted
curve. But once we get back to sort of a normalized curve in a normalized environment, I think the deposit betas
will really come back down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
This is Mike, again. You can see that in our public disclosures, the cost of deposits was around 1.96% for the
quarter, but for the month of March, it was 2.14% and we're originating new core deposits around 2.50%. So back
to the comment that I think Ira made earlier around, don't think that every incremental dollar is being funded by
something in the brokerage space, which is closer to 5%, because we also have a promo rate right now on our
Internet at 4.20%. So the blended rate will come down, but the beta is definitely going to go up, as I said earlier,
due to the competition that we're seeing in the marketplace for deposits, especially post March 9.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And how have deposit flows gone post quarter end? Has the mix shift continued and our balances up or down ex-
brokered?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. The shift has actually been pretty good. A couple of really good examples of that would be in our tech
business. As Ira pointed out early on, 10% of our tech deposits were gone. Only half of those, however, were
made up of one customer unrelated to the crisis, and they're only at 5% reduction in March. So we feel pretty
good about where that is relative to the overall industry.
Another bright spot would be that our branch deposits, even when you consider the fact that people are making
tax payments, our branch deposits held in very well, in a post March 9 environment. So the flows haven't slowed,
the flows are still good. We opened as an example, I think Ira mentioned this in his prepared remarks, 7,000 new
accounts just in the month of March. So the flows have been good. But obviously, we have 15% growth in loans,
you're going to have a higher percentage of that being funded by broker just because of the sheer number or the
average of those balance sheet increases.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Have you seen any customers or hiring opportunities stemming from signature and dislocation at some of the
other nearby banks?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, Matt. It's Tom. We're always going to be opportunistic to add teams of people as long as it follows our
relationships driven strategy and our credit standards. So the short answer to that is, yes, we do see
opportunities.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2023
Okay. And then, last one for me. Just on new commercial real estate loans, either those involved in a transaction
or resetting into a new kind of five- or seven-year fixed rate, what is the ultimate change in value, particularly on
commercial real estate office that you're seeing appraisals come in at, particularly for loans that are pre-COVID.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. We are seeing across the board increasing cap rates, as you would expect, more so in the office and retail
industry than we have seen in multifamily and industrial. We're not major office players, especially in Manhattan.
We have $260 million of Manhattan office. So we're – the NOIs are down. So we would expect that's going to
drive the values more so than the cap rates have increased to drive those values, but we have not seen any
material deterioration. As a matter of fact, we only have one office loan on non-accrual, that's $315,000.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think one of the things to really look at, Matt, is [ph] assuming (00:41:10) what our day one underwriting
was. As an example, multifamily for us, the cap rates were 5.42%, right? And when you look at sort of where the
environment has been on that, sort of reflects, how we underwrote at day one. So I think some of the change that
others are seeing based on changes in interest rates and cap rates, really are going to have less of an impact on
us.
And I think maybe just going back to an earlier question that Tim might have asked sort of what are our clients
doing? And we're very fortunate to have a very strong, knowledgeable client base that has been in the business
for a very long time. And they're really the first line of defense here. I was with a client the other day, they actually
walked away from a $3 million deposit that they had on a project because they thought the economics just didn't
work out now, and there were other opportunities that were going to happen. So our client base didn't just get into
the real estate market three, four or five years ago, they've been in for a very long time. They are very astute and I
think there's going to be a lot of ability for us to help support them, as they continue to look at opportunities that
are going to come about in this economic environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. And Matt, just a final point on this. Our average – our weighted average loan to value on our real estate
portfolio is 58%; on our office portfolio, it's 54%. So there is tremendous cushion in our previous underwriting
standards, as Ira had mentioned.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
All right. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Good morning. Mike, I was writing kind of fast. Can you go over the efficiency ratio guide again, and what
you're thinking on overall expense growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. So as a reminder, if you were to go back to first quarter of 2022, you would also see an efficiency ratio that
started with the 53% to the left of the decimal place. So for us to be at 53% in the first quarter, based on the
seasonality of some of our expenses, that being the largest portion of it being the various payroll taxes associated
with compensation-related expenses. It's not unusual.
And I also want to point out the second thing that is a large impact on the expense side, which is the increase in
FDIC assessment rates that increased that 2 basis point annual increase in rate that drove a $2.3 million increase
in our expenses as well. So when you back those out – as we've said in the past, our long-term goal is to have a
below 50% efficiency ratio. When you back those out and you consider the NIM compression that we've talked
about previously, it seems reasonable to think that the bias right now might be slightly over 50% for the remainder
of 2023.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So you're saying for the remainder of 2023 from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So what I'm saying is 53% is seasonally high. And I think that something over 50% wouldn't be that terribly
and we're not talking about 53%, by the way. We're talking 50%, 51%, 52%. Yeah.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2023
Okay. And how about the fee piece of the equation? Any drivers or anything to call out in terms of your
expectations there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yes. Two things, I think are really important. One, I hope it doesn't get lost in everything else that's going on. Our
fee income was actually pretty good in the first quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
That was up over fourth quarter. And when you look at the drivers of that, the swap and the FX business, the FX
business came to us from Leumi and we're selling the Valley legacy customer base into that. Those were strong.
And then the one negative that's in there, that will come back is there is some seasonality to have Dudley
recognizes their revenue, and we expect that to come back in the second quarter. So I feel pretty good about fee
income.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thank you for that. And then Ira, you brought up [ph] a bit on SVB (00:45:18) and you talked about how
you're open to opportunities that would have been a bigger deal. But what might make sense for you guys? And
are you seeing any more or less in the way of opportunities to do something strategic?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
So I would say I think there's going to be a lot of opportunities available to us. And I think [ph] Valley as (00:45:41)
the function of the granularity and diversity that we have today within our balance sheet, we've identified a couple
of more strategic initiatives for the last three, four years. One of them was focused on diversity. One of them was
focused on continuing to build sort of specialized business lines across the organization to reduce some of the
concentration increase, to help expand some of the alternative funding sources, as well as continuing to identify
alternative non-interest income sources. So I do believe there's going to be opportunities out there for us.
That said, for us, it really has to align from a strategic perspective and I think that's really critical. We have a lot of
internal and organic opportunities that I believe tremendous to us, and it will be incremental for us to really go
ahead and look at something else. So I do think there's going to be other opportunities. I think we'll be able to look
at them. But I think we'll be very disciplined sort of like we were on the [ph] SVB bid (00:46:37) that has to make
both strategic sense for us, as well as economic sense for us. One of the things that I've been focused on for the
last five years is making sure that our tangible book value grows. And I think something I'm very, very proud of
when you think on a relative basis, we've done much better than our peers in tangible book value growth over the
last five years. So that's something that sort of remains top of mind to me.
