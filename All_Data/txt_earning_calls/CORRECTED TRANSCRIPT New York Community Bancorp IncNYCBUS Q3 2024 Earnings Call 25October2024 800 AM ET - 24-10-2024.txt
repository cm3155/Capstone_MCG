Thank you, Sal, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We're actually pretty
excited about the quarter and what we've accomplished during the course of the quarter. And today, we're going
to review the third quarter results and update of our three-year forecast and provide an overview on our key
strategic initiatives.
As I've mentioned in the past, it is important for the board and management team that we remain engaged with
the analyst community and investors on our progress as we continue to transition for the remainder of 2024 and
2025. During the third quarter, we continue to make significant progress on multiple fronts towards our goal of
becoming a diversified regional bank, which focuses on consumer, small business, commercial banking, private
banking, and commercial real estate. And some of the actions that we've taken over the last three to five months,
point us in that direction.

Turning to slide 3. Under the first area, you will see that with our board transformation complete, we are quickly
building out our middle market, commercial banking and specialized industry lending verticals. With the addition of
over 30 new hires in this space over the last 90 days. This includes seasoned lenders and the infrastructure to
support them. In addition, we're excited, we also hired a new Chief Information Officer. His name is Chris Higgins.
Chris previously worked at U.S. Bank and most recently was the CIOO at MUFG. Chris brings tremendous
amounts of experience and will be a key asset and leader in the company as we go forward as well.
One of the things I think we're most excited about as we continue to attract top-tier talent to the organization in
virtually every area, excuse me, every area of the company. And I'm very confident in the leadership team to the
bank.
As far as our executing on our operating plan, this quarter was the second consecutive quarter of really solid
deposit growth, both in retail and in the private bank. In the private bank, we're seeing many customers returning
to the bank after the disruption earlier this year, and we are winning new relationships. Moreover, the private
banking deposits are more moderately priced, having weighted average costs in the low 2% range.
Last quarter, I talked about the opportunity to exit another $2 billion to $5 billion in non-core businesses. During
the quarter, we made this strategic decision to exit certain non-relationship-based businesses, and reduce our
exposures under some larger exposure where we syndicated our positions out within the C&I portfolio. As a
result, the C&I loans declined $1.3 billion or 8% compared to the second quarter to the runoff of these loans.
Our pro-forma CET1 ratio, including the impact of the sale of the MSR and third-party origination business, is
11.4%, which compares very favorably to our peers. And as a matter, we do anticipate at the end of this month,
the first of November, of closing the sale of the servicing MSR and third-party broker business to Mr. Cooper.
Also, we made significant progress in reducing operating expenses through head count reductions and cost
controls, while still investing in key areas like our commercial, private banking and our risk infrastructure. Last
week we announced a workforce reduction plan, which will show up in our fourth quarter results. And in addition
to that, we've also taken out significant non-personnel cost as we focus the organization and brought talent in to
perform functions within the organization. And as Craig will speak to you shortly, we are on track to meet our
earnings forecast goals by year-end 2027.
Under improved funding profile, and these are one of the areas that when Craig and I first arrived, we talked
about increasing the liquidity in the company. Our liquidity remains extremely strong at over $41 billion, resulting
in an approximate 300% coverage to uninsured deposits. We also utilized a portion of our excess liquidity during
the quarter to pay down $9 billion of wholesale borrowings. And during the month of October we paid down an
additional $1 billion, which will help improve our funding cost over time.
Finally, there is our focus on credit and risk management. You'll get a chance to hear from Kris Gagnon, our new
Chief Credit Officer. We have completed reviewing virtually the entire CRE portfolio. At the end of the third
quarter, we were 97% complete compared to 75% in the second quarter. We continue to proactively manage our
problem loans and take appropriate action to de-risk the loan portfolio, including taking significant charge-offs and
continuing to build our allowance for credit losses. In addition, we continue to add both talent and resources in our
risk management area as we build-out our risk governance infrastructure.
Slide 4 highlights the five key takeaways for the third quarter. The biggest takeaway from our perspective is that
our multi-family borrowers continue to support their properties. During the first nine months of the year,
approximately $2.1 billion of our multi-family reached their repricing date. And in most instances, these properties

are repricing from the mid-3% to the mid-6s or higher. Of these loans, over 90% have either paid off, or are at par,
or remain current.
We also continue to reduce our CRE exposure, as Kris will discuss, we had another strong quarter and loan
payoffs. As you know, one of our key strategic goals is to reduce our CRE portfolio to about $30 billion over time,
and these payoffs certainly will help us towards that goal.
Deposit growth, as we've previously discussed in our prior earnings calls, was another one of the highlights this
quarter. This growth, along with us paying down about a third of our wholesale borrowings, resulted in a positive
shift in our funding mix.
And lastly, I believe we are well-positioned to successfully execute on our C&I strategy, which we've talked about
trying to get significant growth in C&I, which I will discuss in the next two slides.
On slide 5, highlights, the senior management team we have assembled within the commercial and industrial
space to drive our growth in this area. Rich Raffetto oversees this effort and has assembled, what I believe as a
long-time commercial banker myself, some of the best leadership in the industry, reflecting our commitment to this
strategic area of growth. As you can see, we are hiring a proven group of individuals to execute on our business
strategy.
Slide 6 outlines our C&I strategy. We already have a good platform to build from with approximately $16 billion of
C&I loans. Our goal is to get that to $30 billion in the next three to five years by expanding our existing platform
across middle market, corporate banking, and various specialized industries, and building out our product
capabilities and to drive fee income in relationship pricing.
Part of this build-out includes hiring more experienced bankers and support staff. To date, we have brought in
more than 30 individuals and continue to attract top talent.
I'm really pleased with how far the management team has brought the company over the last seven months. We
are building a great company that will be reflected in our future financial results. And I'll now turn it over to Craig,
and I look forward to your questions.

Craig E. Gifford
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Joseph.
On slide 7, you can see our financial balance sheet information, and you can see that our CET ratio, on a pro-
forma basis for the sale of the MSR business, as Joseph mentioned, is 11.4%. We ended the quarter with an
actual GAAP ratio of 10.8%. The 60-basis-point increase on a pro-forma basis reflects the lower RWAs from the
sale of the mortgage transaction, as well as the increase in capital that comes from the small gain that we expect
to recognize on the transaction. Joseph mentioned that we expect that transaction will close in the next couple of
weeks. Adjusting for AOCI, our pro-forma CET1 ratio is 10.7%. In general, we have lower securities unrealized
losses than our peers. And you can see that our liquidity position is robust and continues to improve.
Slides 8 and 9 present an updated forecast out through 2027, and I'll cover some of the more relevant changes
from prior information that we provided. The most significant updates reflect an expectation that our non-accrual
loans will remain elevated through 2026, which Kris will discuss in more detail. We also reflect an expectation of a
higher FDIC assessment cost level through 2026, principally related to our criticized and classified loan levels.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2024
And there's a line switch between margin and fees related to the cost of subservicing deposits that go away this
quarter, which I'll describe on the next page.
You can see that from a ratio perspective, the impact of those items does reflect an expectation from a EPS
perspective of a reduced level of earnings in 2025 and 2026. But as we get beyond the non-accruals and the
FDIC assessment increases, we would expect 2027 to be consistent with our previous expectations.
Turning to slide 9, from a margin perspective, as I mentioned, we will have pressure on non-interest – excuse me,
on interest income, related to a higher level of non-accruals out through 2026. Additionally, in 2025 and 2026,
there's roughly $150 million of a change in remapping of interest expense on the custodial deposits, which
reduces from prior forecast our net interest income, and increases our non-interest income. So, again, it's just a
line switch.
If you think about margin, our margin does continue to improve beginning in 2025 through 2027, as a result
principally of repricing of our commercial real estate and multi-family loan portfolio. We do expect that our margin
has bottomed in the third quarter. You'll see in our press release the margin percentage, we expect a similar
margin percentage in the fourth quarter, and then increasing through 2025.
Our provision for loan losses was impacted by a charge-off level net of recoveries of $240 million in the third
quarter. We do have an expectation of a similar, although probably slightly less in the fourth quarter of charge-
offs, and then tapering in 2025. Our expectation for the full year of provision for loan losses for 2024 is a $1.1
billion to $1.2 billion. That's an increase from our prior guidance, and that is related to our experience on the
charge-offs associated with multi-family loans. As Kris will point out, the multi-family portfolio continues to perform
quite well, and the vast majority of loans that are in our non-accrual portfolio continue to be current on their
payments.
From a non-interest expense perspective, we do expect a higher level of FDIC assessment, again, principally
related to the criticized and classified portfolio. That has an impact of about $100 million a year in 2025 and 2026.
Incrementally, in the fourth quarter of this year, the mortgage transaction will close in the next couple of weeks,
but we had previously anticipated that it would be completed by the end of September. Regulatory approvals
delay that a little bit, and that will have a little bit of a negative impact on expenses for the fourth quarter. These
reflect those changes.
Slide 10 shows the success that we're having on the deposit gathering front. As Joseph said earlier on the call,
this is the second quarter of very solid deposit growth. We continue to grow deposits in the retail channel, up $2.5
billion or just under 8% this quarter. We also had a very good deposit growth quarter in the private bank, with
deposits increasing $1.8 billion or 11% to nearly $18 billion as our bankers are successfully winning new
relationships and many customers are returning dollars to the bank. More importantly, the private banking
deposits overall carry a lower cost of funds that generally are more moderately priced.
And now I'll turn the call over to Kris Gagnon to discuss our asset quality and credit metrics.

If we turn to slide 11, we had just over $1 billion in commercial real estate payoffs during the third quarter,
bringing the year-to-date amount to $2.6 billion. Importantly, these payoffs were at par, and approximate 34% of
these payoffs were related to our substandard portfolio.
If we move to slide 12, this is an update of our annual CRE portfolio overview. Through the third quarter, we have
reviewed 97% of the total CRE portfolio. That includes 97% of the multi-family portfolio, 93% of the office, and
94% of the non-office CRE.
We turn to slide 13, just an overview of the multi-family portfolio. The key takeaways here are that year-to-date,
we had $2.1 billion of multi-family loans. Repricing of those loans, 34% paid off at par, and the remainder stayed
within the bank. We'll talk about the repricing that we're facing going forward in the next slides.
So, slide 14 provides a few more details on the multi-family portfolio. Approximately 3% of the portfolio is left to
review. These are loans with an average balance of $3 million. So, we're getting to the smaller end of the
portfolio. All of the largest loans in the portfolio have been reviewed, and nearly all of the loans with rent regulated
units between 50% and 100% of total units have been reviewed.
What I want to spend a little bit of time though is on the bottom-right side of the portfolio. As you can see through
2027, we have a significant amount of loans that, multi-family loans, that are either going to reprice or mature.
And the important thing to understand here, is that as these loans enter a window, 18 months in advance, we
reevaluate those loans at current market rates and their ability to service those loans, the borrower to service
those loans on the changed terms. This can lead to more severe classification of those loans if the result of the
analysis is that the cash flow is either impaired or insufficient to service the loans appropriately.
Moving on to the office portfolio on slide 15. We reviewed 93% of this portfolio. Again, I think, we've gotten
through the largest loans, so there's, the remaining 7% is generally smaller balanced loans. We've been very
proactive and aggressive in managing this portfolio. We've taken significant charge-offs through the years with
this portfolio. Because early on the larger loans that we looked at, there were some idiosyncratic losses. I think,
we're largely through those issues. The office reserves associated with remainder of the loans in the portfolio is
6%, which compares favorably alongside our peers.
Slide 16 is our non-office CRE portfolio. 94% of this portfolio has been reviewed. Most loans that remain to be
reviewed are again, less – the smaller end of the portfolio, which are non-New York City loans. It's a very
diversified portfolio.
Slide 17 provides our allowance by loan category. Our allowance for credit loss is up to 1.87% this quarter,
compared to 1.78% the prior quarter.
And then, slide 18 provides some further perspective around asset quality. We have been diligently identifying
problem loans and working towards resolution. You can see that on this slide that this quarter we had
approximately $600 million increase in our non-accrual portfolio. Important to note that 68% of these non-accruals
are actually performing as agreed to the terms of their credit agreement. And this sort of relates back to the issue
that we talked about before as we put some of these loans on non-accrual or substandard, is related to future
ability to pay as they enter those repricing windows.
So, with that, Craig, I'll turn it back over to you.

Craig E. Gifford
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Okay. Thank you, Kris. Slide 19 depicts our liquidity profile. Overall, our liquidity remains quite strong due to the
success of our deposit gathering efforts over the last two quarters. We have $41.5 billion of total liquidity, which
represents about 300% of our uninsured deposits.
Slide 20 summarizes our third quarter financials. And as I mentioned, the net loss attributable to common
stockholders was $289 million, or $0.79 per share, principally driven by the provision to expense for the quarter. It
was also related to a lower level of non-interest income due to the sale of the mortgage warehouse portfolio,
which closed in July.
Joseph, I'll turn the call back to you.

Joseph M. Otting
Executive Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Kris and Craig. One final slide before we'll turn it over for questions. On slide 21, we show New
York CB's investment profile. We currently trade at 63% of tangible book value. We think being able to move
forward and deal with our credit issues, and then, the emergence of our C&I strategy should help close that gap.
This compares to 179% for Category IV banks, and about 155% for regional banks. So, a significant upside in the
company as we execute on the business plan.
I would also like to thank a number of you recommended and suggested that we convert our holding company
name. We chose Flagstar Financial with the symbol will begin trading on Monday as FLG. This aligns the overall
organization going forward with our Flagstar brand in the branches, which between November and March of last
year, and November to March of this year, we rebranded all the branches with a consistent brand, consistent look,
and consistent theme now, all across our retail banking franchise, which, all of you know, is California, Arizona,
Florida, New York, New Jersey and then around Michigan, Great Lakes. So, a really solid retail banking presence.
So, finally, I'd like to thank each of our teammates for their dedication and determination and their commitment to
our customers. And now, we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, you can now open the

Hi, good morning.

Joseph M. Otting A
Executive Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Hello. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I appreciate all the color and the moving pieces between the old and new guide. Was any of the change from the
change in the forward rate curve? Can you talk about how you think the balance sheet is positioned for rate cuts
here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, we're slightly liability sensitive. We will benefit from a bit from lower rates. We do have quite a bit of
very short-term assets in our cash and securities portfolio. So, we'll certainly benefit from a deposit side
perspective, but there will be pressure on the on balance sheet liquidity aspect of the portfolio.
I would say, though, that we've been very successful in bringing down our deposit rates in the last six weeks. So,
on our – more liabilities, our more rate sensitive deposits, our savings portfolios and our CTEs, we've actually
have a higher than 100 basis points beta. We brought down those rates between 60 basis points and 75 basis
points compared to the Federal Reserve move. So, we've been very successful in tapering that.
The impact of that in the fourth quarter will be a lower level of deposit gathering on the retail bank, I would expect.
I think that will be flat to slightly positive from a retail deposit gathering and – but, I still think, we'll see strength in
the private bank, probably not as strong as the third quarter was, but we'll still see deposit growth in the private
bank in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And if I can have a quick follow-up, so, it seems like that the main difference between the two guides,
between last quarter and this quarter is the, the non-accrual loans. So, what's causing those non-accrual loans to
remain on the balance sheet for longer? Is it that you'd rather not sell them given the pricing being offered in the
open market, and would you consider selling them down the line?

Yeah, thank you for that question. We're exploring all opportunities to reduce our non-accrual portfolio. We're
working with borrowers to work them out. We are looking at discounted payoffs. We will explore the market to see
if there's an opportunity to sell. In some cases, so far as we've looked at that, we think that we can do better
working them out ourselves as opposed to selling them. So, those are some of the avenues that we're taking to
reduce the portfolio.

Good morning.

Hi, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Just wanted to follow-up on the credit comments. So, the 68% of loans on non-accrual, and the maturity
profile that you show through 2026, 2027, I'm just trying to get to – it looks like your provisioning outlook did not
change, quarter-over-quarter as you talk, look into 2025, 2026. So, are we to conclude that at this point, credit
quality risk tied to repricing, all of that, even for loans that are coming up for repricing in 2027, has been ring-
fenced either through reserves, or these loans have been already put into non-accrual? So, what I'm getting to is
the risk of negative surprises on credit from here, should be fairly limited. And talk to us in terms of the rate
sensitivity, like the five-year being 20 basis points or 30 basis points higher or lower from where it is today, does
that have a meaningful impact in that analysis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Ebrahim, thank you. So, the rate profile is interesting, right? Because at the end of the third quarter, rates had
come down at the five-year point, roughly 90 basis points. But since then, they've backed up about 35 basis
points to 40 basis points. So, we were cautious in reflecting the improvement in rates in the reserving, recognizing
that it can be transient.
But, I will say that the decrease in rate levels that we've seen is quite favorable to the portfolio, in our credit
modeling, probably about a $200 million improvement in the credit risk profile as a result of the improvement in
rates. And I would expect a similar level of that as rates continue, if rates continue to decline at the intermediate
term. But, importantly, it's that intermediate term point that is particularly relevant for the repricing of these loans.

As Kris mentioned, if you look out into the projections from a provisioning standpoint, I do expect that the
provisioning for the 2025, 2026 timeframe is still relatively in line. I think that we'll see a higher level of charge-offs
in the first quarter and tapering through the rest of the year.
Kris pointed out on slide 14, the maturity profile or the reset profile of the portfolio. So, we are effectively reflecting
in our criticized and classified loans. Those loans that we would expect to reprice out through the middle of 2026,
so that's 18 months from now. And if you look at that chart, then you still have a reset profile out beyond that,
which would be reflected as we then begin to regrade those loans, as they move into that that repricing window
that we analyze from a loan rating perspective. But, we feel like from a provisioning perspective, the guide reflects
the impact of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That was helpful. And just one follow-up question, maybe, Joseph, for you. I think, you talked about where the
stock trade from relative tangible book. I think, the concern from an investor standpoint is the lack of visibility, like
you've seen a lot of senior hires that you've announced, but we saw the big change in 2026 – 2025, 2026
earnings outlook relative to what we expected last quarter. Appreciate, 2027 is the same. Just talk to us in terms
of how we can measure all the senior hires that you're bringing on to the bank. Banking is a tough business, even
doing a 10% ROE. So, I'm just trying to understand, is the goal and should we start seeing proof points of these
teams and come and we should see accelerated low cost deposit growth, loan growth as we look even starting
fourth quarter, 2025. And what's the best way to measure that we are moving in the right direction in that regard?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
Executive Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Ebrahim. I think, it first starts with like, how are we rebalancing the balance sheet and our goals here?
We're sitting somewhere slightly south of $45 billion in commercial real estate. And our goal is to get that into the
low $30 billion range. And so, we're doing that through a combination of payoffs, which are averaging somewhere
around, since we've arrived, roughly $1 billion a quarter. So, obviously, that's $4 billion times three is $12 billion.
So, we naturally get there in a three-year period.
So, that rebalancing is occurring with, going in our C&I book today, which is about $16 billion. In 2027, we would
like to get that into the $30 billion range, is our goal. And so, most of us who have joined this company have spent
the vast majority of our career in the C&I kind of space and grew up in it. And so, we've gone out and have added
really talented people, who are highly experienced, who have operated in this space for, some of us 25 to 35
years. So, we bring those relationships and direct involvement with CEOs and CFOs, and companies that we
bank.
So, to answer your question, we do see right away the ability, as these people come on to the organization, the
opportunity to do outward bound solicitation into relationships. And the other avenue is if you look at the makeup
of our C&I portfolio, very limited of that is commercial and corporate banking. And the type of people that we're
hiring are commercial and corporate bankers. So, it isn't like we're going into these syndicated credits or large
one- or two-bank credits where we have a lot of exposure in that area. We are somewhat of a new entrant into
that segment of the market, which should present us some pretty significant growth opportunities.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2024
The balance sheet projections, if you think about the portfolio that reprices and resets, and the experience that
we've had in repayments, if you look out on a projected basis, something between $750 million and $1 billion of
commercial real estate and multi-family runoff per quarter over the next two years. And as we get into late 2025,
we're projecting a pretty similar level of increases in commercial banking and C&I growth from a loan perspective.
We're also expecting that those bankers bring in deposits and that will increase our deposit growth starting in late
2025, pretty significantly through 2026 and into 2027. Roughly, I think about it as roughly a two-for-one-basis
loans for deposits. So, we're expecting that that commercial banking group does bring in deposits that are
supportive in funding that loan profile.

Hi, Dave.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Sorry if I missed this earlier, but I heard you mentioned the $2 billion to $5 billion of assets that you've had
assessed as non-core. And you talked about that last quarter as well. Was just wondering where you guys stand
on that now, just given the runoff that we've seen on the C&I front. And then, are you still looking at the business
and trying to analyze for core, non-core and could that increase from here? How are you guys thinking about
that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
Executive Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, we've done virtually a business review of all the businesses now in the company and are in the markets
generating new C&I loans while some of those had been tabled prior to our arrival. But we are – the viewpoint
overall is that the businesses that we have today we like. There are certain aspects of some of the businesses,
where we wanted to reduce our exposure, either because where we are in the cycle in relationship to that
industry, or our viewpoint was in some of the hold levels in the company were larger than what our comfort level
was. And so, we brought the hold levels down and then brought participants in for those credits.

So, I'd say it's a combination of reevaluating where we are in the cycles for certain industries. And then, the other
is reducing hold limits. The bank historically took very light hold positions in credit and we just favor a more
diversified portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2024
Yeah, I would say that we continue to improve our visibility into the portfolio, into the credit performance, and into
the expense profile of the company. This is now, Joseph and I, second quarter of in-depth review of the financials.
We have instituted an in-depth review at the business line level each month on our financial performance with
each of the senior leaders. So, every month we get more and more visibility.
I have a pretty good degree of confidence in the non-interest income – excuse me, in the net interest income and
the margin line at this point. Again, there's a bit of noise in the – everyone's comparing the projections because of
the remap associated with the cost of those mortgage deposits. We had projected that as a benefit in the margin
line. That's actually a benefit in the fees line, which is where the – where that has previously been recorded from
an expense perspective.
The other areas, obviously, what we're seeing from a non-interest expense perspective, we did take a pretty
significant action last week. That will improve our expense profile on an ongoing basis, roughly $200 million a
year, and we still have more to go. So, this forecast expects that we will continue to identify efficiency
opportunities, many of which are underway as we continue to improve our technology capabilities, and our
business processes. And those will result in further cost improvements as we get into the 2025 and early 2026
timeframe.
The FDIC assessment pressure is something that, it's related to the business profile and related to the, the way
the FDIC determines its insurance premiums. It's a complex formula, but it does encompass some things that are,
that provide – that result in an increased rate for us. And I expect that'll go through 2026. That's probably the most
significant change in the forecast from an earnings perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. I'm curious, Craig, on your modeling, what are you assuming in terms of
the balance sheet size, maybe at the end of 2025 and the end of 2026?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We're essentially assuming a relatively flat balance sheet. We're assuming that we will see a transition from
commercial real estate, multi-family loans, into C&I loans. As the real estate loans repay and runoff, and the C&I
begins to come on as those bankers get traction in the marketplace. So, not seeing a lot of balance sheet growth
or projecting a lot of balance sheet growth through 2026. But we are projecting a degree of balance sheet growth
in the commercial banking space in 2027.

Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, guys. Good morning. First question is on revamping the company structure. You know, you've done a good
job on bringing new hires on the senior management level and changing the Board. I know you highlighted
progress within C&I. Can you just talk to like what inning you are in with regards to building out your C&I platform?
14


New York Community Bancorp, Inc.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2024
And then in risk management, given previous deficiencies identified, how far are you with revamping your risk
control function? And then just lastly, on the same topic, any other further head count optimization left to go that
hasn't been announced?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
Executive Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So at, obviously, the board level, we announced that Peter, who is a long-time Flagstar Board member, will
be leaving the Board. And we do anticipate to fill that position hopefully in the fourth quarter. So that is kind of the
remaining Board spot. At the kind of what I would call the executive management team, we are fully deployed
now. And with the addition of Chris Higgins, that completes the rebuild of the executive management.
The next level down, we've hired 10 to 20 people in that category where we've upgraded both risk positions and
infrastructure under Craig's world of finance people to help us prepare our financials. We have confidence in
them.
And then, when you look at the two specific areas you mentioned, I'd say in the C&I, we're rounding first base, is
what I would say. We anticipate to go from roughly 30 hires to 130 hires, it's what's built into our plan that we will
build that out. So, we have a fair amount of hiring to do, but we're not hiring all those people at once.
Now, we're going to start to grow the revenue, and so it will be a revenue – of seeing the revenue, then we'll add
the expense, seeing the revenue out the expense.
On the risk infrastructure, I think, that's a relatively good story of the direction and how far we've come in seven
months. Obviously, we've added some really highly talented people who worked at the OCC for the vast majority
of their careers. That includes Bob Phelps, Sydney Menefee, and Bryan Hubbard. So, three very senior people
from the OCC and it helped us.
One of the things that we're doing in the company is really building out the first and second, and third line of
defenses. Those were not here in the organization. And as everybody knows, that category bank, core bank, you
have enhanced standards you have to adhere to.
But I really feel good about the people and the direction that we're going in that regards. And I do believe that we
work closely with the regulatory community since we all arrived. I mean, obviously my background of being the
Comptroller, I understand the importance of that. And so I think we've built a strong bridge to our regulatory –
regulators. We appreciate their input and guidance as we build this. But I would say, as we look, the risk
infrastructure, we feel really good about where we are with the risk management in the organization, our internal
audit. And we're building out the first line of defense in the business units. And that's also built into our cost
model.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay, great. Thanks for that color. Just maybe as a follow-up, so you paid down nearly $9 billion of borrowings,
utilizing your excess liquidity from the business sales and deposit growth. And you noted that you paid down an
initial $1 billion in October. What are you targeting as a normalized level of borrowings, and how can we think of
the pace of those coming down from here?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2024
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, so, thanks for the question. So, if you look at the third quarter, we will have a reduction in the overall
liquidity of about $3 billion related to the mortgage servicing sale, business sale. So, those deposits will leave and
we have been holding excess liquidity to provide for that.
From here, I think that will relatively match the loan growth with deposit growth. We have a bit of excess liquidity
that we will use to reduce our broker deposit funding in 2025 as those brokered deposits which are principally
CD's come due. We won't – I don't expect it will replace those brokered deposits on a dollar-for-dollar basis. So,
we'll see the broker deposit funding come down, and then, as we grow customer deposits, particularly in the
private banking commercial space, then we'll look to continue to repay some of our wholesale borrowings with the
home loan bank. But I wouldn't expect that it would be material in the rest of 2025. And assuming the rest of 2024
and then 2025, maybe a couple of billion dollars.

Hi, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Thanks. Okay, just circling back on the deposit trends, could you give us a spot rate on the
deposit costs at the end of the quarter? And then, you talked about a beta, the early beta being greater than
100% on some of the retail deposits. How should we be thinking about beta over the next few rate cuts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, our spot rate on our savings is, is at 5%, that was about 55 basis points three, or if you call it, six
months ago, even three months ago. So, we brought that down over 50 basis points and I would expect to see
that continue to decrease as rates decline here in the fourth quarter a bit further.
Modeling from an overall interest bearing deposit perspective, I'm modeling a 50 basis points beta, obviously on
the more premium product, it'll be more significant than that. And from a private banking perspective, again, we
see that's a little more moderate deposit base because it has more non-interest bearing DDA type of accounts
there. So, when we bring on those deposits, generally that has not been in our at our most premium rates, it's
been in a more moderated rate. And that's what I would expect going forward.

Okay. All right, thanks. And then, as a follow-up, how should we be thinking about the multi-family reserve level
here with the expectation for higher losses? Have you been reserving for that? Or we should expect to see that
reserve level start to go higher with the provisioning going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well it's a balance of the expectations around the criticized and classified portfolio, as well as the level of charge-
offs. I don't expect to see the reserve level coming down significantly in the in the fourth quarter, in the first
quarter. Beyond that, as we get into 2025 and 2026, particularly as the portfolio gets through a lot of the repricing
and we see how the borrowers perform against that repricing, that will inform where we go with reserve levels. But
I think, we'll see a pretty consistent reserve level for the next quarter or two.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
I just wanted to clarify something here on your guide, a little bit forward couple of years. Because I believe, Craig,
you talked about the remapping. So, if you look at NII change, and then, fees change, and the remapping was
kind of associated with the ECR – excuse me, just remapping of a couple of items. So, net-net, like revenue is
down $5 million. That's kind of what you wanted to convey? I just wanted to make sure that's the net change
associated [indiscernible] (00:46:02) revenue difference.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. To keep it simple in 2025 and 2026, there's 150 million that moves from non – from net interest income to
non-interest income. And that's associated with the earnings credit on the escrow deposits, subserviced escrow
deposits. Incrementally, I do expect a higher level of non-accruals than what we had previously contemplated out
through 2026. And that has an increased level of pressure in the guide for 2026.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. Okay. And then coming at ECR, or excuse me from an expense guide perspective, you guys had
increased at $150 million. So, when you think – is that $100 million of that roughly to FDIC, that guidance for kind
of just the credit-related items which is really just temporary. Like once you have lower rate, you assume you
17


New York Community Bancorp, Inc.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2024
could probably do a little bit better on the credit review. And so that doesn't get taxed. It's not tax deductible.
That's kind of what the difference is. I know it's the footnote here, so I'm just trying to think, like your guidance
didn't really change much, you're just kind of elongating that expense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Particularly with respect to the FDIC, that's correct. Yeah. The piece related to taxes is mostly because the tax
rate moves around quite a bit, and that's because the FDIC piece is pretty sizable. The FDIC assessment is pretty
sizable. And being non-deductible, it represents a fairly large percentage of the bottom line over the next two
years, and that causes the tax rate to move around. So that footnote is just explaining the tax rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. So, when you think about that rate perspective, if you were to move rates lower, back to kind of where it
is were recently a couple of weeks ago, you'd probably get a little bit more of a green light to change. How long do
you need to be in that green light? You need 12 straight months before things would look better on a credit
perspective, due to the rates? Or, I'm just trying to think about the timing of which you think it'd look, like it is
better, but you can't just oscillate these things quarter-to-quarter based on rates themselves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Right. We can't move them around. And the other challenge is that once we – once we do have a downgrade, the
rates have to move pretty substantially in order for us to be able to upgrade the loans. And so that – that pressure
continues out for a couple of years. I do expect it'll be through 2026.

Joseph M. Otting A

increase at a, not at the pace that we've seen thus far, but as we – we still have a bit of financial information to get
through, and we have things moving into the repricing window. So I think the trend would be for an increase in
substandard and special mention.

That's correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. Got it. And then, on the general cost of funds for the company going forward, how would you look at that
relative to wherever Fed funds goes? Like, if we look at a year from now, if Fed funds is [ph] 4% (00:49:36), for
example, would the cost of funds be at a more of a discount to that than it is today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'm thinking about the math of your question. I think that the answer would be our average cost of funds, would be
at roughly the same discount that it is today on in total. If you think about our funding profile, about half of our
funding profile is very short-term priced and the other half is either non-interest bearing or longer-term priced. So,
you can kind of do the math of that as the Fed moves the short-term price component of that. I expect that we'll
see a very high beta on that. So, virtually all of our wholesale funding at this point is priced something under a
year. And of course, our savings deposits are moved immediately. So, I think that you'll see that discount remain
roughly the same over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
Executive Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
The mix will change a little bit with wholesale. With more C&I customers coming on board, the mix of that will
move more to transaction accounts, which should help as well.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'd actually like to see it be a bit higher. I think that will continue to gather customer deposits. Over the course of
the next two years, we'll see a relatively flat overall balance sheet, and continue to gather deposits then. So, I
would expect that it would improve, that we'll see a continued decrease of the loan to deposit ratio. But it won't be
of the significance that we've seen in the last two quarters.

the share count once the almost all the preferreds are converted? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, the share count has pretty much settled down. The end of quarter share count will be – is reflective of
the expectation on an ongoing basis. Virtually, all of the preferred that I expect will convert in the near term did
convert in the third quarter and that's been public information. From a one-timer perspective, in the fourth quarter,
I do expect that we'll see some charges associated with the mortgage business transaction exit. So, we'll have
some asset impairments and a bit of severance. And then, the action that we took last week also have some
severance associated with it.
All in, I think that those charges will be in the $100 million range.

Hey, good morning. I was hoping we could first talk a little bit about loan portfolio yields. So, loan yields have
been down for four consecutive quarters despite kind of a positive repricing narrative and repricing dynamics
within CRE multi-family. So, I guess, how much accretion was there this quarter within loan yields? How much
impact did non-accruals have? And when do you think we can actually start to see loan yields begin to expand?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2024
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
The majority of the impact on – from decreasing loan yields is from the non-accruals. There is not much accretion
at this point that's built into the margin or that would go away. It's maybe $15 million a quarter that tapers off over
the next four quarters. If we think about from a repricing perspective, here you can see that we've got about $5
billion a year that will reprice and that moves up from an average rate of about $3.5 billion to – in our forecast, we
do have rates coming down, but at that intermediate term level, not a lot.
So, we see that those loans, as they come in from a repricing perspective, reprice from the $3.5 billion level up to
the $7.5 billion level. So, that's what's driving the increase. And I do think that we'll see that that turn in the fourth
quarter a bit. And then, as we get into 2025 and we see less incremental non-accruals than what we've had on a
quarterly basis for the last two quarters, then we'll see that turn positive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then, I just wanted to go back. You've noted that you expect the balance sheet to be flat a
couple of times now. If I look at the forward guide, the NII and then guide it implies it will take earning assets down
to around $102 billion in 2025 and 2026 from $109 billion today. Can you just talk a little bit about that and then
the pros and cons of going below $100 billion as it relates to Category IV bank designation? It feels like you're
hesitant to go that route, to go sub $100 billion. I'm curious if there's more to it than we currently understand.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
Executive Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, regarding the $100 billion level, if you work your way through that, if you get below $100 billion, you still have
four quarters that you are anticipated to be compliant with the Category IV. And then, from a regulatory
perspective, when you start to get close to $90 billion, you have to put in place a plan to become compliant. So,
just because you get below $100 billion doesn't mean that you don't have to have the enhanced standards. So,
that isn't like our target to get below $100 billion and, said, what we've taken the approach was to build out the
appropriate risk infrastructure in the company. And then allow our business model to take it where we can grow
and expand.
And so, it isn't a goal of ours. It isn't a desire. And quite frankly, you probably have to shrink $20 billion or more to
get to the point where you wouldn't be subject to those standards.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Is my thinking correct in that earning assets could shrink $5 billion to $10 billion here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. But I think that there's a reasonable chunk of that is actually coming out from a cash perspective. So, it's
earning, but we're deploying that cash either to pay down debt or to pay down brokered deposits. So, in the loan
portfolio, I don't expect it to be decreasing as much as the cash component.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I don't know if this is an easy question or hard question, but if the economy stays in kind of a steady state, when
do you guys think we'll see the peak in non-performers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think the repricing that comes into the portfolio over the course of the next two years will continue to have a
component of it that moves into non-performing. And so, I think we'll see a continued level of new additions to
non-performings through 2026. And then the question becomes how quickly we will be able to action the existing
portfolio of non-performers. Many of the loans that are in the non-accrual category are in there because of our
focus on looking out at the repricing characteristics. And a pretty stringent assumption that – or a criteria, that
from a classification standpoint would suggest that we expect them to default. The reality is that we see the vast
majority of them continuing to perform even when they do reprice. And so, that will – those loans are performing,
they are amortizing their principal balances. But I think that we'll continue to see new loans being added to the
non-performing portfolio over the course of the next two years as loans reprice.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Anything unusual about this quarter in terms of the review? Obviously, it didn't go up like last quarter, but are you
saying, this is increasing at a decreasing rate or how material do you expect it to be, the increases?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kris A. Gagnon A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. No, there wasn't anything particularly unique about this quarter. We just continued to run our process. We
still had financials to grind through. The level of new sub-standards, sort of, in the same pace that we saw before.
We've gotten through the bigger loans, so it's smaller. So, we're looking at a lot of smaller loans that – more
widgets but there wasn't much of a change. We're just sort of getting through it. This is an annual process. As
Craig said, this will continue. Each year, we'll have to do new financial reviews and review these loans as they're
getting into the refinance window. So, I wouldn't say that there's anything unique.

The one thing that I would add is, Kris, as this is an annual process, but we went to a standard on the expectation
is that the borrowers would provide us the financial data. And perhaps in the past, there was more lax about
whether they sent their financial data into the company. And then, second of all, I think there's a new standard of
underwriting around debt service coverage and loan-to-value, as opposed to using loan-to-value for the risk rating
process. And so that in itself, there's more rigor around your primary and secondary source of repayment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kris A. Gagnon A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, I agree with that, Joseph. We were very aggressive in terms of getting financial information, and I think 98%
of our borrowers provided financial information, which is significantly higher than in the past. And we did in the
second quarter, institute changes relative to how we evaluate risk, with more of a focus on debt service coverage
ratio than, as Joseph said, as opposed to loan-to-value. But you know, that process started in the second quarter,
and continued on into the third, and that will be our standard going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. That helps. And then just two others. You guys do a lot of benchmarking in the presentation. And I
know this isn't an easy question, but what do you think the normalized, more normalized reserve percentage
should look like for the company in 2026 and into 2027.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
From a provisioning or overall reserve percentage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Overall reserves. Overall reserves. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I think our portfolio is pretty idiosyncratic and it kind of depends on how the portfolio performs as we
transition into a more C&I based portfolio and balance of portfolio. I think that you'll see the C&I reserve levels will
be substantially lower than what the commercial real estate levels on the existing portfolio are. And so, that will
have an impact, but it will really depend on the portfolio performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
Executive Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Portfolio mix, it's very important.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
The mix? Okay. You said the mix. Okay. I understand that. And then on slide 9, and then some of your comments
about the margin thinking, I hate to ask it this way, but is that the easy part of the formula? Just the margin lift
from CRE repricing, is that just the natural output of the maturity schedule? And you have high confidence in that
margin trajectory?

Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, the bulk of that, it's the margin percentage is a combination of the repricing of the commercial real estate
multi-family portfolio. But it's actually tempered a bit with the C&I build because we expected the C&I loans would
have a slightly lower overall spread than the commercial real estate and multi-family loans as they reprice. So it's
the C&I, it's the lift from the repricing, balanced with the growth in the C&I portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q

Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A

Hi, Steve.

Hi there, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
I just wanted to follow-up on non-performers here. The multi-family bucket was the driver of the increase this
quarter. And I'm just curious if that's related to the roll forward set up in terms of the 18-month look forward on, as
you analyze what's substandard and criticized, and just that, maybe there'll be certain quarters we'll see the step
up given the repricing dynamics stretch out into 2026, and pick up in 2027? Or, if there's something special this
quarter about the, something else that drove that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, this quarter is a combination of getting through more of the portfolio. We moved from 75% to 95% of the
portfolio, and another quarter coming into the 18-month window, so to speak. Moving forward, we have a little bit
more of the catch-up to do, but not much. And then, we'll each quarter have more loans that will come into the
window. It's about $1 billion a quarter for the next four quarters that comes into the window. And then, the 2027
repricing that move in are about a $1.5 billion a quarter that move into the window for evaluation.
And when they do, some portion goes to substandard, some portion remains in pass graded with that that
repricing pathway, is what will drive it moving forward. If you get – once we get beyond fourth quarter or we've
gotten through the full portfolio review.

Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then, just one follow-up here. In terms of I know the secondary market seems to have improved here in
the past couple of months. Just curious if you think there's any potential for an acceleration in prepays for the
multi-family portfolio? You know, just in the shifting rates. I know we've had a backup here in the last couple of
weeks, but I'm just curious if there's any possibility.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
Executive Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, one commentary would have, obviously when rates, as Craig mentioned, backed up a bit, there was
somewhat of a flurry of a lot of people locking in rates. I think, because they've, now increased back up slightly,
people are waiting to see the next Fed move. But that should spur a fair amount of refinancing. And what we're
finding is, people are coming out of pocket to rebalance loans. And our objective would be for them to take those
loans elsewhere and get financing.
So, we have found in the, a number of the large office transactions we have, as you probably noticed, we moved
one large transaction to help our sale. We do expect in the month of November to close that transaction. We
marked it at what our agreed upon sales price was for that transaction. And there are a number four or five other
large transactions were under discussion at this point. So, there is interest even in the office space for investors.
And, some of those we're selling at where we have a market, and some of them we're taking slight losses. But
overall, that we do think that will pick up.
And then, on the multi-family side, there has been kind of a renewed interest even in the rent regulated space for
people looking for assets in that space. So, we are optimistic that in the next couple of quarters, as we did bring
on a new Head of our Workout Group, he's organized that group with a team who is doing outreach to customers,
and having dialogue. We have an assigned kind of SWAT team that's taking that on. We do think we'll see the
fruits of that that activity going forward.
