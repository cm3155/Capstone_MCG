Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I know with our recent acquisitions the numbers are a little more
complicated, but I am pleased with our results for the fiscal third quarter and the first nine months of the fiscal
year. Despite challenging market conditions, we have continued to invest in our business, our people and
technology, to help drive growth across all of our businesses.
In the Private Client Group, excellent retention and recruiting of financial advisors contributed to industry-leading
growth with domestic net new assets of 9.4% over the trailing 12-month period. In the Capital Markets business,
while investment banking revenues were negatively impacted by continued market volatility during the quarter, we
continue to see strong pipelines as the expertise we have added both organically and through niche acquisitions
has performed very well.
In fixed income, we completed the acquisition of SumRidge Partners, just after the quarter on July 1, which will
enhance our platform with technology-driven capabilities and a fantastic team with extensive experience in
dealing with corporates.
In June, we completed the acquisition of TriState Capital Holdings, including TriState Capital Bank and Chartwell
Investment Partners, adding $11.8 billion of loans and $9.4 billion in financial assets under management. In
addition to TriState's contribution to our loan portfolio, Raymond James Bank grew loans at an impressive 8%
during the quarter, reflecting attractive growth across almost all loan categories. So, as we always do in any
market cycle, we continue to invest for the long-term, always putting the client first.
And while the decrease in fee-based assets from the equity market declines during the quarter will negatively
impact asset management and related administrative fees in the fourth quarter, we are well-positioned for
increases in the short-term rates given our attractive growth of earning assets, the majority of which floats with the
short end of the curve. Furthermore, we have maintained a flexible balance sheet with solid capital ratios well in
excess of regulatory requirements.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Turning to results on slide 4, I fully appreciate there were a lot of moving parts this quarter, which Paul Shoukry
will explain in more detail. In the fiscal third quarter, the firm reported net revenues of $2.72 billion and net income
available to common shareholders of $299 million, or earnings per diluted share of $1.38.
Year-over-year and sequential revenue growth reflects primarily the benefit of higher short-term interest rates on
both RJBDP fees from third-party banks and net interest income, which more than offset the declines in total
brokerage revenues and investment banking revenues, resulting from the challenging market environment.
The decline in net income available to common shareholders was primarily attributable to increased business
development expenses and a higher bank loan provision for credit losses during the current quarter, which
reflects the strong growth at Raymond James Bank, a weaker macroeconomic outlook and the $26 million initial
provision for the credit losses on loans acquired from TriState Capital Bank, as Paul will discuss in more detail.
Excluding $65 million of expenses related to acquisitions, quarterly adjusted net income available to common
shareholders was $348 million or $1.61 per diluted share.
Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 13.3%, and adjusted annualized return on tangible common
equity was 18.1%, an impressive result, especially given the challenging market environment and our strong
capital position.
Moving to slide 5, sharp equity market declines in the quarter, including a 16% sequential decline in the S&P 500
Index, negatively impacted client asset levels. We ended the quarter with the total client assets under
administration of $1.13 trillion and PCG assets in fee-based accounts of $607 billion. Financial assets under
management of $182 billion, which includes Chartwell Investment Partners, decreased 6% sequentially as a
decline in equity markets more than offset net inflows in the acquired assets during the quarter.
We ended the quarter with 8,616 financial advisors, a net increase of 203 over the prior-year period and a
decrease of 114 compared to the preceding quarter. Results this quarter reflect the transfer of 188 advisors,
primarily from one firm to our RIA & Custody Services division, or RCS, during the quarter. While transfers to RCS
impact the advisor count, the client assets typically remain custodied at the firm. Excluding these transfers, the
number of financial advisors increased 74 from the preceding quarter, reflecting our continued low, regrettable
attrition and strong recruiting.
Our focus on supporting advisors and their clients, especially during volatile markets, has led to strong results in
terms of advisor retention, as well as our recruiting of experienced advisors to the Raymond James platforms
through our multiple affiliation options. Over the trailing 12-month period ending June 30, 2022, we recruited to
our domestic independent contract and employee channels, financial advisors with approximately $300 million of
trailing 12-month production and approximately $47 billion of client assets at their previous firms.
And highlighting our industry-leading growth, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of nearly $98 billion
over the four quarters ending June 30, 2022, representing 9.4% of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the
period. Third quarter domestic PCG net new asset growth was 5.4% annualized, a strong result given the impact
of client tax payments in the quarter.
Bank loan growth continues to be strong. Raymond James Bank generated impressive loan growth of 26% year-
over-year and 8% sequentially to a record $30.1 billion. Additionally, TriState Capital Bank brought over $11.8
billion of loans this quarter, which represents a record for them, as they have continued to generate very attractive
loan growth across their portfolios.

Moving on to segment results on slide 6, the Private Client Group generated record results with quarterly net
revenues of $1.96 billion and pre-tax income of $251 million. While asset-based revenues declined, the segment
results were lifted by the benefit from higher short-term interest rates.
The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $383 million and pre-tax income of $61 million.
Capital Markets revenues declined 14% over the prior-year period and 7% sequentially, mostly driven by lower
fixed income brokerage revenues and equity underwriting revenues due to the volatile and uncertain markets.
The Asset Management segment generated net revenues of $228 million and pre-tax income of $93 million. The
sequential decline in revenues and pre-tax income in the Asset Management segment were primarily attributable
to the negative impact on financial assets under management from the decline in equity markets.
The Bank segment, which now includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank, generated quarterly
net revenues of $276 million, which is a record result and pre-tax income of $74 million. Remember, we closed on
TriState Capital on June 1. So, this quarter only reflects one month of their results. Net revenue growth was
mainly due to higher loan balances and significant expansion of the Bank's net interest margin to 2.41% for the
quarter, up 40 basis points from the preceding quarter. Despite revenue growth, the Bank's segment's pre-tax
income declined primarily due to the aforementioned higher bank loan loss provisions in the quarter.
Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on slide 7, we generated record net revenues of $8.17 billion during the
first nine months of fiscal 2022, up 16% over the same period a year ago. Record earnings per diluted share of
$4.99, increased 8% compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2021. Additionally, we generated strong
annualized return on common equity of 16.3% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of
20.1% for the nine-month period.
Moving to the fiscal year-to-date segment results on slide 8, all four core operating segments generated record
net revenues and the Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset Management segments generated record
pre-tax income during the first nine months of the fiscal year, again, reinforcing the value of our diverse and
complementary businesses.
And now, for a more detailed view of the third quarter and year-to-date results, I will turn the call over to Paul
Shoukry. Paul?

Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. Starting with consolidated revenues on slide 10, quarterly net revenues of $2.72 billion grew
10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Asset management fees grew 13% over the prior year's fiscal third
quarter and declined 3% compared to the preceding quarter, in line with the guidance we provided on last
quarter's call.
As a result of the steep declines in the equity markets during the quarter, Private Client Group assets and fee-
based accounts ended the fiscal third quarter down 11% compared to March 2022, creating a significant
headwind for asset management revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter.
Brokerage revenues of $513 million declined 7% compared to the prior year's fiscal third quarter and 9%
compared to the preceding quarter. The decline in brokerage revenues was largely due to lower asset-based trail
revenues in the Private Client Group, as well as decreased brokerage revenues in the Capital Markets segment.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
I know some other financial services firms posted year-over-year increases in institutional fixed income brokerage
revenues. But remember, we intentionally do not have a meaningful presence in the much more volatile interest
rate commodities in currency trading businesses, which benefited many of those larger firms this quarter.
I'll discuss account and service fees, net interest income shortly. Investment banking revenues of $223 million
declined 5% compared to the preceding quarter. While our pipelines are strong, there is a lot of uncertainty given
the heightened market volatility. Given the market environment, we are really pleased with the investment banking
result this quarter. And our best guess right now is that we could achieve a similar result in the fiscal fourth
quarter if the markets remain relatively resilient over the next couple of months.
Moving to slide 11, clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at $75.8 billion, down 1% compared
to the preceding quarter and representing 7.8% of domestic PCG client assets. As of this week, these balances
have declined to approximately $73 billion, reflecting the quarterly fee payments, which were paid in July and
comprised of roughly half their decline this month, as well as some continued cash sorting activity during the
month.
Turning to slide 12, combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $370 million, up an
astounding 102% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and 65% from the preceding quarter. This revenue
growth is largely a result of higher loan balances in the Bank segment, as well as higher short-term interest rates,
which really reinforces our longstanding approach of taking limited duration risk with a high concentration of
floating rate assets.
You can see on the bottom-left portion of the slide, the Bank's segment's net interest margin increased a
substantial 40 basis points sequentially to 2.41% for the quarter. The average yield on RJBDP balances with
third-party banks increased to 88 basis points in the quarter. Both the NIM and the average yield from third-party
banks are expected to increase further from the recent and anticipated rate increases.
For the fiscal fourth quarter, factoring in the rate increase this week and some assumptions around deposit beta
and other variables, we would expect the average yield on RJBDP from third-party banks for the fiscal fourth
quarter to average around 1.7%. As for the Bank's segment's NIM, we expect it to average around 2.7% for the
fiscal fourth quarter, which would reflect around two months of this week's interest rate increase and a full quarter
of TriState Capital's contribution.
But these projections will obviously be impacted by the actual deposit beta we experience. We will continue to put
clients first and focus on staying on the more generous end of the spectrum for our clients. So far, our cumulative
deposit betas since the Fed start increasing rates in March has been around 20%, but that has accelerated with
each subsequent increase to about 30% with the June increase. We would expect the deposit beta to continue
increasing with each incremental rate increase.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 13, let me point out a significant change we made this quarter to our
presentation of expenses. Namely, we eliminated the acquisition-related expense line item and now are including
all the expenses in their respective line items. At the same time, we are now capturing more acquisition-related
expenses in our non-GAAP adjustments, including items such as amortization of acquired identified intangible
assets, acquisition-related retention and a bank loan provision item I will discuss in more detail shortly.
For example, this quarter, $65 million of expenses related to acquisitions are included in the non-GAAP
adjustments as detailed on the reconciliation table on slide 21, which provides the amount of associated expense

per line item as well as a five-quarter history. We hope these refinements, which I know have been very common
across many of our peers, are responsive to many of your requests and helps you gain a better understanding of
our operating results. And as always, we will emphasize our GAAP results alongside any adjusted results we
disclose.
So, turning to our largest expense, compensation, the total compensation ratio for the quarter was 67.5%, which
decreased from 69.3% in the preceding quarter. We also introduced an adjusted total compensation ratio this
quarter, which adjusts for acquisition-related retention and compensation as outlined on the slide 23. The
adjusted compensation ratio was 66.8% during the quarter. The sequential decline in the compensation ratio
largely reflects the benefit from higher net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks.
Non-compensation expenses of $469 million, which includes $47 million of acquisition-related expenses included
in our non-GAAP earnings adjustments increased 21% sequentially. Business development expenses increased
to $58 million, reflecting the advisor recognition events and conferences, as well as increased pent-up travel
during the quarter.
To put this in perspective, prior to COVID, the fiscal third quarter was typically the high watermark for this line
item. And in the fiscal third quarters of both 2018 and 2019, this line item totaled $57 million. And since then, our
business and revenues have grown substantially, including through several acquisitions.
The bank loan provision for credit losses increased considerably to $56 million. A big portion of this increase was
a $26 million initial provision associated with TriState Capital acquisition, where purchase accounting requires us
to establish an initial allowance for loan losses associated with the acquired loans as the pre-closing allowance
does not transfer over.
To help you with comparability to prior periods, we did adjust for this portion of the bank loan provision in our non-
GAAP results. The remaining portion of the bank loan provision during the quarter, around $30 million, was
primarily associated with the 8% sequential loan growth at Raymond James Bank, and a weaker macroeconomic
outlook.
Other expenses increased to $85 million for the quarter. The majority of the sequential increase was attributable
to increased expenses associated with acquisitions during the quarter, which are included in the non-GAAP
adjustments.
So, I know there has been a lot of noise over the past couple of quarters with the Charles Stanley and TriState
Capital acquisitions. But the main takeaway on expenses is we remain focused on the disciplined manage of all
compensation and non-compensation related expenses, while still investing heavily in growth and ensuring high
service levels for advisors and their clients.
Slide 14 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. In the fiscal third quarter, we generated a pre-
tax margin of 15.3% and an adjusted pre-tax margin of 17.7%. While the market environment has certainly
become more challenging since our Analyst & Investor Day in May, we still believe the 19% to 20% pre-tax
margin target we laid out is appropriate given the significant benefits of higher short-term interest rates, assuming
the market stays relatively resilient at current levels.
On slide 15, at the end of the quarter, total assets were $86.1 billion, an 18% sequential increase, reflecting the
addition of TriState Capital, as well as solid growth of loans at Raymond James Bank. Liquidity and capital
remained very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $2 billion, well above the $1.2 billion

target. The Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.8% and the total capital ratio of 21.4% are both more than double the
regulatory requirements to be well-capitalized, providing significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and
invest in growth.
Also, I would note that the Tier 1 leverage ratio includes just one month of TriState Capital assets and doesn't yet
reflect the assets from SumRidge which closed on July 1. So, the spot Tier 1 leverage ratio following the
SumRidge acquisition is below 10%, still well above the 5% regulatory requirement. And as I said on the last
quarter's call, we don't view the client cash we're accommodating on the balance sheet at the broker/dealer and
the Client Interest Program, which ended the quarter at $13.7 billion, the same as our other balance sheet assets.
So, we still have ample balance sheet flexibility after adjusting for those excess cash balances on the balance
sheet.
I am very pleased with the progress we have made deploying capital over the past two years since we first
disclosed our capital targets, really reinforcing our priority to utilize capital to invest in long-term growth across all
of our businesses and deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. The effective tax rate for the quarter
increased to 27.5%, up from 25.4% in the preceding quarter, primarily due to higher non-deductible losses on the
corporate-owned life insurance portfolio.
Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. Following the closing of the
TriState acquisition on June 1, we began repurchasing common shares under our board authorization. We
repurchased approximately 1.14 million common shares for $100 million or approximately $88 per share. As of
July 27, 2022, approximately $900 million remained available under the board approved share repurchase
authorization.
As we explained on prior calls and at Analyst & Investor Day in May, our current plan is to offset the share
issuance associated with the acquisition of TriState over the next few quarters. And I believe our action in June
demonstrates this commitment. But we will continue to closely monitor market conditions and other capital needs
as we evaluate further repurchases over the coming quarters.
Lastly, on slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment. And remember, these metrics reflect our
newly formed Bank segments, which includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality
of the loan portfolio remains strong and most trends continue to improve. Criticized loans as a percent of total
loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.63%, down from 4.07% at June 2021 and 2.63% at March 2022.
So, now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?

Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. As I said at the start of our call, I'm pleased with our results. And while there are many
uncertainties, I believe we are well-positioned to drive growth across all of our businesses.
In the Private Client Group, next quarter results will be negatively impacted by the expected 11% sequential
decline of asset management and related administrative fees that Paul described earlier. However, focusing more
long-term, our recruiting pipelines remain strong and combined with solid retention, I'm optimistic we will continue
to deliver industry-leading growth as advisors are attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology
platform. The segment will also continue to benefit from higher short-term interest rates.

In the Capital Markets segment, the M&A pipeline remains robust, but the pace and timing of closings will heavily
be influenced on market conditions. Over the long-term, I am confident we are well-positioned for growth as the
significant investments we made over the past five years [indiscernible] (00:27:51) our platform and increased our
team and productive capacity.
In the fixed income space, we expect SumRidge Partners to enhance our current position in the rapidly-evolving
fixed income and trading technology marketplace.
In the Asset Management segment, while financial assets under management are starting the fiscal fourth quarter
lower due to equity markets, we are confident the strong growth of assets in fee-based accounts in the Private
Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management. In addition, we expect
Carillon Tower Advisers with its new addition of Chartwell Investment Partners, to help drive further growth
through increased scale, distribution and operational and marketing synergies.
And the Bank segment is well positioned for rising short-term interest rates as we have ample funding and capital
to grow the balance sheet prudently and most importantly, the credit quality of the Bank's segment's loan portfolio
remains strong.
As always, I want to thank our advisors and all of our associates for their perseverance and dedication to
providing excellent service to their clients each and every day.
With that, operator, I'm going to open it up for questions. Thank you.

Gerald Edward O'Hara Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks and good morning. I was hoping you might be able to just help to unpack a little bit of the
comments around the cash sorting in the quarter and just sort of maybe give us a sense of what you saw and
perhaps what we might expect in that dynamic. Thank you.

Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thanks, Jerry. How are you? Good morning. Yeah actually, the cash balances in the quarter stayed relatively
resilient, as you saw, was only down about 1% for the quarter. Now, in the month of July, we have seen a decline
in client cash balances. We're at about $73 billion now, almost half of that was from the quarterly fee billings,
which all come up in the first month of the quarter. And then, the other portion kind of reflects the cash sorting that
we've been expecting for quite some time now as rates start to increase. And just to put it into context, just a year
ago, we were at $63 billion of total client cash balances, which were elevated from the pre-COVID days. So, I
don't think it should be surprising to see some cash sorting as rates increase going forward.

Gerald Edward O'Hara Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks. And then, maybe just a follow-up on expenses, Paul. Appreciate the sort of commentary around
the growth of the business and the quarter being typically something of a high watermark. But can you maybe
help us just sort of think about how that might trend on a run rate basis over the next couple of quarters given
obviously sort of increased T&E and some of the other sort of normalization expense pressures that we're seeing.
Apologies if I missed it, but I think that'd be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Certainly, business development expenses were much higher this quarter. Last quarter, it seems like an
eternity, but we were still dealing with omicron. So, people really weren't traveling at the beginning of the quarter.
This quarter we have our biggest advisor conference for the independent advisor business. So, we – that – and
this is a quarter we've had it historically even pre-COVID, which is why it usually is the high watermark quarter.
And people are starting to travel again, there's a lot of pent-up travel out there of people wanting to see each
other in person again. So, I think when you look at – just stepping back and looking at non-compensation expense
in the aggregate on a GAAP basis, it ended at $469 million for the quarter.
Now, about $47 million of that were non-GAAP adjustments related to acquisitions. So that gets us down to on an
adjusted basis for non-GAAP – a non-compensation expenses about $422 million. We still have two more months
of Tri-State Capital to reflect there. So that's about $10 million if you look at their $15 million run rate, but some of
the expenses this quarter were elevated. So, may be a good sort of jumping off point plus or minus a few million
dollars as we look at the next couple of quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I know the line item was higher than people maybe anticipated. But I think you also have to remember, if you
compare it to the 2019 and 2020 numbers, that was about 3% of revenue in that quarter. It's about 2% of revenue
this time, I mean. So, we've grown significantly. I think we're managing the costs very well. So, just based on
those percentages, I don't think we're back to where we were. You can see we're managing expenses, but our big
conferences and our biggest advisor events have occurred in this quarter so it's not atypical, so.

Hey, guys. This is Michael on for Alex. So, I think we kind of want an update on the timing and size of how you're
thinking about swapping TSC's deposits with RJF's deposits? Any updated color you can give us there would be
great. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
First, I'll let Paul talk about that. But I think you guys, we can deploy cash in either bank. And it's really almost
irrelevant whether it's in TriState or Raymond James Bank versus the sweep. So, we have a lot of options and
flexibility to maximize the earnings on cash as banks are looking for bank sweeps again where they weren't
before. So, it's a question I know you all keep asking. We've already made some progress on that, but part of it
really depends on TriState's clients, they're operating for their clients and they have depository relationships
there, too, but we're making progress. And, Paul, I'll let you get into a little more of the detail. But I think
strategically as you go forward, you should look at how much is deployed and not necessarily in which franchise.
So, Paul?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think you covered it very well, Paul. And we've already supplemented their deposit base with about $1 billion of
our deposits and we have plans to supplement with another $1 billion. But as Paul said, they're running an
independent business, they have their clients, we want to certainly honor their relationships with their clients. And
frankly, over the next few years, those deposits and those diversified funding sources could be very valuable to us
as an organization overall. So, we're not focused on the short-term accretion of a standalone business. We're
really focused on maximizing flexibility and earnings for the organization overall.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Vinci Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs
Great. Thanks. So, it sounds like the kind of initial commentary you guys gave when the acquisition was closed is
kind of what we can still expect?

Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I'd say the trend is that way, right? So, I guess we could change based on where we can deploy the cash and
what they need. But so far, we're on the kind of the plan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Vinci Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs
All right. Great. And then, maybe one quick follow-up. You guys gave us the guidance for the fiscal fourth firm-

Yeah. I mean, we gave you kind of the biggest component with the NIM average for the quarter, for the fiscal
fourth quarter. We're expecting it to be about 2.7%, which would be almost 30 basis points higher than the 2.4%
that it averaged this particular quarter. So – and we've had some nice growth in earning assets, both from
Raymond James Bank on a standalone basis, which grew 8% sequentially and then of course adding on TriState.
So, I think those kind of give you the main inputs to calculating net interest income.
And then, the BDP fees which are substantial as well, they averaged 88 basis points this quarter. The cash had
swept over to third-party banks and we said that with the rate increase that was announced yesterday and some
assumptions around deposit beta that we expect that to increase to 1.7% on average for next quarter. So, really
significant tailwinds coming from net interest income in RJBDP fees from third-party banks.
And I think the important thing here is, we've been criticized for quite some time for not taking more duration. I
know a lot of our peers have done that. But our long-standing approach of staying flexible and not trying to time
the rates to the markets and the bond curves, is going to serve us very well in this rising rate environment.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, Paul. Since you ended on that response talking about your decision to manage the Bank in such a way
where you have more short-end gearing, I know that's serving you quite well, certainly in this upcoming tightening
cycle. At the same time, the market is starting to price in rate cuts beginning in 2023 and in the last Fed easing
cycle, the decision to maintain that sensitivity did create a fair amount of earnings volatility. You cited some peers
that have overextended themselves, taking on too much duration. I happen to agree with that statement, and I
think that they're getting punished as a result in this type of environment. But there is also a balance that could be
struck where you maintain some healthy mix of fixed versus floating rate assets. Curious if that's something you'd
be amenable to protect that earnings or NII downside, if and when the Fed begins easing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Steven, you remember this well, because you're very close to it. 2015, we had no securities at all on the
Bank's balance sheet. And so, we do – we have been more balanced and diversified in that regard. And I think we
plan on continuing to be more balanced and diversified. But almost all of our deposits are floating rate deposits.
So, to take on much more duration would essentially be making a bet between and a mismatch between the
assets and the deposits. So, our focus is to, to your point, be more diversified and we are much more diversified
than we were just five or six years ago with our securities portfolio. And we also have jumbo mortgages on the
balance sheet that has some duration to it, tax exempt loans et cetera. But we will – I think you should expect us
to continue to be more exposed to the short-end of the curve, just given the nature of our deposit base, which is
floating.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
No, really helpful color, Paul. And for my follow-up just on some of the deposit beta commentary, if I think about
how you guys manage deposit cost last cycle, you're trending more in line with the industry in terms of overall
beta. So far you've been running a little bit ahead of peers. I believe the word that you used on the call was you'd
be generous with deposit rates. What beta should we be modeling beyond the fiscal third quarter? And what's
driving the decision to be more competitive on pricing this cycle? Is that reflective of some of the cash sorting
headwinds you cited or something else?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I just think that – look, we knew a bunch of rate increases were coming, right? So – and a lot of people you
can take to a process, you can maximize your return. But our belief when everybody was talking about how much
cash and there was too much cash is that, as businesses grew and rates went up and you can see what's
happened in the public markets where people haven't had access, there would be more demand for cash. And
we're seeing that in the bank sweep program. Even the biggest banks are coming back into the bank sweep
program, which tells you everyone's looking to liquidity. So, our view was we could be more aggressive. We'd
have chances on further increases to modify, or not to be as aggressive if we could see a cooling down or going
the other way, but is to make sure that we first treated clients fairly, but we did a good job of retaining cash
balances. I mean, we've lived through cycles when cash was really tight in the industry and some people are
already putting out high yield savings and other CDs and deposits to fund now, right? So, their sweep rates may
be lower, but they're also adding higher cost deposits. So, we're just trying to look long-term on it, take care of
clients. And yet, we know in a rising rates if they keep rising, we think we always had time to adjust. So, Paul, I
don't know if you want to comment on changing beta or not, but it's hard to tell until we have a rate setting
committee. It'll certainly be what it was at least historically, it may be a little higher.

Hi. Good morning. Maybe first question is on PCG segment expenses. Total segment revenues were up 15%.
Compensable revenues, I think, were up 10%. But when you look at the PCG administrative comp expenses, they
were up 22% year-on-year. I know some of that may be related to inorganic growth. I guess when you look year-
on-year, you haven't have the organic growth rate for those expenses. And any more color as to kind of what's
driving that level of growth, both year-on-year or even the [ph] $70 million (00:42:58) sequential increase we saw
in that line item? Thank you.

Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So that was actually a good catch, because what we haven't specifically drawn out in the numbers is that
we've all been concerned about our associates and the impact of inflation in this environment. And a number of
firms have done kind of across the board comp adjustments or comp across the board salary adjustments. And
we decided to take a different course, which we did this quarter, is to give really just a off-cycle bonus to our lower
paying associates to help them cope with the inflationary costs of gasoline, housing and everything else, and not
do an automatic salary adjustment really for two reasons, as salaries are forever, but more importantly as we
wanted to do it thoughtfully across all of our associates in our year-end process, which is actually a number of
months, is to make sure that people are rewarded accordingly and that the salaries are [ph] benched mark-to-
market (00:44:04) instead of just doing a raise now that it's hard to do an unraise for those who shouldn't have,
we gave kind of a one-time bonus and that really hit the segment. But it really is taking care of our associates and
doing an unbelievable job. We've been great. Our turnover has certainly been up, but it's been lower than the
industry. They've been doing a good job for us and we felt we owed them to do this, which should take them to
the year-end until we get to our normal cycle adjustments.
Paul, I don't know if you want to go through anymore in terms of numbers or anything else, but that was the
biggest impact of that number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I guess, could you quantify the impact of that bonus, Paul?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. In total for the firm is about just under $15 million for the firm and PCG takes the majority of it just because
they're by far the largest business and have the most associates.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. And then, my follow-up is just on the advisor count, you noted that there was a switch of 188
advisors with most of them from one firm moving to your RIA division. Can you just help us understand how large
those switches were from an AUM standpoint? And then, any more color on the switch? Can you kind of remind
us of the change in economics when migrations like that happen? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, first, strategically, we've set up and really bolstered our RIA offering just because it was – and it has been
the fastest-growing segment in the industry. And the good news is when people have switched to RIA they
haven't gone to any of our custodian competitors, almost virtually 100% have stayed at Raymond James. So, it's
been a good retention tool. This was really one big firm whose business model has changed. We knew it was
coming, we've been planning on it for a year. The good news is again they stayed with Raymond James. Their
assets are custodied with us, but in the RIA model they're not FINRA licensed. And the way we count advisors are
producing advisors who have a FINRA license. But once they go into the RIA space, we can't count that anymore.
So, if you look at it since really a year and a half, it's been about 250 advisors. There was a big group that moved
at the end of the year, relatively big, but it's usually three or four advisors a quarter. And this was a one-off
14

movement that really focused on kind of a changing business strategy for them. So, I think it was – it's not
certainly business as usual. It's one of the largest firms on the platform that went to RIA and we don't see people
will continue to move, but it's not any different than the movement between the rest of our channels.

Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jim Mitchell, Seaport Research. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Research Partners
Hey, good morning. Paul, maybe just on the TriState deal now that it's closed – I think since you announced the
deal, obviously rates are a lot higher. You've had – looks like better loan growth at TriState. So, is there any way
to think – can you at least give us maybe a sense of accretion benefits, is it more than you expected and is the
timing sooner, is that the way to think about it, or if there's any kind of greater specificity? That would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think you're right, Jim. All of the sort of – some of the major factors, including interest rates, which is a significant
factor, are increasing much faster than we originally anticipated, which is a great tailwind. But most importantly is
that the TriState has been doing a fantastic job serving their clients through the announcement and through the
closing and integration, and they have been able to continue growing their business nicely with their clients. And
where – frankly, a lot of our efforts are staying out of their way, because they're doing such a great job with their
client relationships and they're handling a lot of change all at once, dealing with their clients. So that's been all
more positive than we originally anticipated. And a great kudos to the TriState Capital team for being able to pull
that off.
Now, with that being said, our earnings base is going to be higher in a higher rate environment as well. So, the
accretion/dilution analysis is a function of both the numerator and the denominator being our earnings base. So,
it's hard to compare apples-to-apples. And frankly, Paul and I aren't really concerned about the short-term
accretion. We're looking at this – we determine the success of a transaction over the next 5 to 10 years. And what
that really entails is keeping their franchise and their client relationships intact, which is going extremely well. It's
great to have that interest rate tailwinds and it's great to see the growth that they're having. But again, we're not
overly focused on what the near-term accretion is going to be, but we're extremely excited by the success that
they've had thus far in the early innings.

The plan is around your timeframe. But again deploying capital if you had big bank growth that was very
profitable, you had an acquisition, you had something else, you could redeploy some of that capital. But the plan
right now is – and there's no plans on any of that right now. But I mean the plan would be to kind of stick to that
course. But we'll watch if the economy really turns down sharply, then you may slow it down. But I think

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Hey. Most have been asked here, but I do want to dig in a little bit more on advisor recruiting. I heard, the kind of
the pipeline remains strong, but there's been a lot of change in the environment. And so, I'd love to just get a little
more context on some of the trends you guys are seeing there. So, one hand, you have markets down sort of I'm
assuming production down, but your higher interest rates makes the businesses more profitable at the firm level.
So, what are you guys, I guess, seeing and are expectations shifting at all on the advisor side?
And then, competitively, what are you seeing and then the fact that markets are choppy and sometimes it's hard
for advisors to leave, when they're inundated, talking to clients. And so, I'm just curious kind of thematically, how
the advisor recruiting pipeline is evolving and what you guys are seeing competitively in the market?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Devin, I think that, first, it's always been competitive. If you look at our kind of our record growth, it's
probably not all and it's not really just an advisor count, but it's the size of the businesses that have been joining
our platform. We have some very, very large teams; one just a few years ago, we would never see. And I really –
it's kind of a testament to the platform that was built in the high net worth and ultra-high net worth space. And I
think the – when Alex. Brown joined us, they brought kind of a lot of knowledge and focus to us on building the
platform for the entire firm.
So, the recruiting is going very well. It goes in cycles. The independent channel was kind of on fire, the employee
channel's been the one this year that's doing really, really well. And I think that's more of the sign of the economy
is where people are joining and the risks they're taking. We have not seen a slowdown. We thought we would see
more people. Typically, when advisors commit the pipeline, they'll – it'll slip. We thought we'd see a lot more
slippage, and we haven't really, maybe a little more. So, advisors are still coming. Once they make that decision,
we rarely see them decide not to leave their firm. So, the pace is still very, very good. It's competitive. It's always
been competitive. We always seem to have in certain spaces, certain competitors really jump out in the market,
17


Raymond James Financial, Inc.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
but I think we pay a fair transition assistance and can't say it's the highest in the market, but we compete very well
because of the value proposition. So, so far so good. It's been – if we had any concerns about it, it still looks very,
very solid right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Great. Thanks, Paul. The follow-up here, I want to come back to something we talked about in late May at your
Analyst Day, and you guys spoke about kind of a focus on new non-compensable revenues and expanding those.
And I think your admin extension being one in [indiscernible] (00:54:34) business consulting group and I know
there's others. Interesting opportunity it feels like from the outside, but want to just get some thoughts around, I
guess, one, how these are going in their early days? And then, two, could these actually become material
financial contributors, a few years out? I appreciate you have to scale them, there has to be adoption. But is the
goal to have them become meaningful revenue drivers or is it more just around kind of the differentiation of the
platform, adding more service and creating kind of more stickiness to the advisor relationship, because you're
kind of more integrated with them? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I think it's more almost the latter than the former. I think that strengthening the platform by offering those
services it makes the platform more attractive and people easier to transition. The uptake on the services has
been much better than we thought. Even existing advisors who have big businesses, whether they're having like
everyone the war on talent or someone gets [indiscernible] (00:55:44) has to be out of the office or we're finding
an uptick of those services and they're very, very happy with it.
So, we're in the early scaling days and I doubt it's going to be a line item like brokerage revenue, but it's going to
be something that certainly is going to positively impact the margins for those businesses. And – so it's early.
We're still scaling them, but so far it's very, very good. But we're just a few quarters really into it, so. But the
reception even of existing advisors is higher than we thought.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning. I apologize if you've already covered this, but my question is on third-party bank deposits.
And what we're seeing from other banks this quarter is that deposit growth is slowing and even shrinking in
certain cases. And that would mean that the demand for your deposits from third-party banks is likely to increase
even further from here. Can you talk about how you're thinking about that? And also the $14 billion or so you have
in the CIP program, I recognize that you have a need for those deposits for your own business now, but I was
wondering how nimble you can be between CIP, third-party bank deposits and your own Bank?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Great question, Manan. We can be very flexible with the deposits to your point. The CIP balances on the balance
sheet are really overflow balances for when we weren't able to sweep the third-party banks because they didn't
have the demand. And so, as that demand picks up, which it has been picking up, still early days, but we're
definitely seeing a change in tone even from the big banks who historically have not been as eager to get those
type of deposits, we're starting to see significant demand from those banks as well.
So, as we start seeing that demand pick up, we would be able to sweep more from CIP to those third-party banks,
all else being equal. So – but we do have a lot of flexibility. It's great to see the demand come back. We knew the
demand would eventually come back, and so that's why we wanted to stay flexible with those deposits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
But can you also be flexible between third-party bank deposits and your own Bank, depending on what level of
loan growth you're seeing at your own Bank?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, the $25 billion that's with third-party banks now and the $14 billion that's with Client
Interest Programs and that has declined somewhat since the beginning of July, as I said in the comments. But
those deposits over time can – a good portion of – a very large portion of those deposits over time could be used
to fund the balance sheet growth to the extent that we find good risk-adjusted returns on the balance sheet and to
the extent that we can grow loans to our Private Client Group clients et cetera. So, again, we have a lot of
flexibility and a lot of capacity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, great. And then, my second question is just how you're thinking about SBL loan growth, you have your won
offering and now also TriState, which you're managing as a separate business, but it still gives you exposure to a
similar loan product. And as we see this pressure and volatility across both equity and fixed income markets, how
should we think about loan growth in that segment, given that rates are moving higher and that loan book has a
low credit risk, is there plan to meet all the demand you have for that portfolio and maybe slow some of the growth
in C&I and CRE as recession risks rise? Or – I mean, I just wanted to get a sense of like how you're prioritizing
loan growth in this environment and what you're seeing in terms of demand?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, first, it's a good question, but the – if you look at what's going to happen in rising rates, I think that it's still a
cheaper source of borrowing for most clients. So, we anticipate that rates get higher and higher and higher and
maybe people don't borrow. But in this environment, it's still a very effective way of and low cost way to borrow.
From our standpoint, we love two things about SBLs. One is the liquidity because it's callable. Secondly, it's very
secured and it's low risk and it has, frankly, the best spreads right now. So – but also it supports clients. So, we
continue to focus on that segment.
We can speed up and any part of the loan segment, we've done it before. I think we're one of the few banks that
sold a lot of COVID loans to reduce risk on the balance sheet. And there are times we have taken different parts
of the portfolio and slowed it down for a while. Most of the portfolio, even C&I has a very liquid portion and the
Term B loans. And so, we do manage the balance sheet. So, we're very happy that SBL loans are in demand and
19


Raymond James Financial, Inc.
(RJF) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
growing and we plan to support that. And we'll look at the relative contribution of each item depending on where
we see the risk return trade-offs long-term.
And the market, if we are offering – if the market starts offering risky credit only then you slowdown that segment.
So, yeah, the TriState market is very different from ours. Our market's internal, their market's external to other
firms and so those are very separate, are run separately, but we like the SBL loans in both categories and both
banks. And have the capital and the cash to fund them, too, which is important. We have a lot of flexibility in
funding.
