Thomas P. Gibbons
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, Magda, and good morning everyone. First of all, I want to welcome Emily to her first results call as
CFO. Most of you are just getting to know Emily, and as you spend more time with her, I think you'll agree that
having been in a number of business leadership roles as well as having had experience in the finance function,
Emily brings a perspective that positions her exceptionally well for this role so welcome Emily, great to have you
here.
Before handing it over to her to review the financials in more detail, let me touch on some highlights in terms of
our performance and other developments. For the third quarter, we reported revenue of $3.85 billion, earnings per
share of $0.98 and a solid return on tangible common equity of 17%.
Our operating margin was resilient at 30% despite the impact of low interest rates and the related money market
fee waivers. And with our share repurchases suspended now for two consecutive quarters, we accreted
significant capital, increasing our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio to 13%.
During the third quarter, volumes and volatilities continued to normalize. At the same time, interest rates trended a
bit lower. As we look into next year, I believe the underlying strength of our franchise will become more apparent
as we expect to have most of the run rate impact of lower rates and associated money market fee waivers in our
earnings.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
At that point, we can start to more clearly demonstrate the progress we're making around our key priorities of
driving organic growth, optimizing the balance sheet and executing our efficiency priorities. And notwithstanding
the challenging current environment, our business model continues to generate significant excess capital. We
look forward to recommencing share buybacks as soon as regulators and market conditions allow, which we
expect to be meaningfully accretive to EPS.
Now there are many opportunities across our business to differentiate ourselves with clients, while addressing a
broader set of their needs. The crisis has increased the frequency and the intensity of my conversations with
clients, as we've helped them navigate related issues. They're adapting to a rapidly changing environment. As
they're assessing what they do across their operations, they want to know how we can help them and optimize
their data and how to be more efficient and effective in what they do on a day-to-day basis.
In asset servicing, we are winning and retaining more deals, and our pipeline is stronger than it was at this time
last year. And I think that's a reflection of the quality of our service as well as the unique set of capabilities that we
can deliver for the front, middle and back office. This is, of course, in addition to providing more custody and
securities lending.
Versus a year ago, we are seeing positive trends in win and retention rates and in our pipeline. Deals are
becoming more complex in cross product and solutions based. For example, we have recently been selected to
provide a range of services by IA Financial Group, that's one of Canada's largest insurance and wealth
management groups, with CAD 175 billion in assets under management.
The mandate encompasses fund accounting and administration, custody, foreign exchange and a full data and
analytics suite of solutions incorporating the data vault and data studio, performance measurement and reporting
and middle office services. We're continuing to invest in building out our cloud-based data and analytics offerings
and have integrated this into our asset servicing core business.
Clients trust us with $30 trillion of data assets on our software, including trillions where asset servicing is
elsewhere. And over 20% of our pipeline deals now include data and analytics products. Just one example, which
I mentioned last quarter is our new ESG app that allows portfolio managers to create investment portfolios,
customized individual ESG preferences using multiple data sources with support from crowd-sourced guidance
around preferred ESG factors and priorities. We're seeing real momentum with this app.
We have a dozen clients in active trials, and we are in discussions with over 100 more. We're also thinking about
how we can integrate capabilities like this when developing holistic solutions for our clients.
In Pershing, the bulk of money market fee waivers is being absorbed by this business, masking its underlying
good performance as the core of long-term drivers remain intact. The pipeline is robust, and the underlying
performance of the business is strong. Firms are critically assessing their business model and their cost
structures. This is particularly true with self-clearing capital markets firms that are increasingly looking to reduce
cost and free up capital by outsourcing their trade settlement and clearing and turning it to us as a result of that.
Year-to-date, new assets on an annualized basis are strong at over 4%. Our pipeline has further improved with an
increase of almost 50% and newly signed business from RIAs who increasingly value our B2B platform,
especially at the custodian industry consolidates. We've traditionally served larger RIA practices and are now
expanding our addressable market to grow this client base, and we're maintaining our leading market share in the
broker-dealer segment.

In clearance and collateral management, we serviced $3.4 trillion in tri-party assets globally. Our ongoing digital
enhancements should continue to drive revenue growth from our existing client base as well as from new clients
that are entering the platform as they accelerate their needs to automate operations, access real-time data and
focus on process optimization and digitization in this challenging operating environment.
Our offerings, which include collateral optimization and advanced analytics solutions, allow clients to move from
manual to automated, straight through processes while optimizing their global securities inventory, which has
proven for them to reduce funding and operating costs and enhance their available liquidity.
We also expect more clients to convert balances from the bilateral repo and securities lending markets to our tri-
party platform as the demand rate – remains high for global asset mobility and operational efficiencies that they
get on tri-party. Investment in wealth management had solid revenue growth, positive long-term flows and good
performance this quarter. Across the 30 comp strategies by revenue, which accounts for about 60% of IM's long-
term annualized revenue, 74% of those have pure rankings that are in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis.
Hanneke Smits has now officially started in a role as CEO of Investment Management, and we also recently
appointed Jon DeSimone as CEO of Alcentra, one of the world's largest managers of private credit. I'm excited to
work with him to accelerate our growth by leveraging Alcentra's strengths in Europe and increasing their market
position in the US. There's an opportunity to grow this manager quite a bit faster.
Across investment management, we're also investing in technology and in developing offerings in ETFs, ESG and
alternatives to align our investment capabilities to evolving client demands. And I think it's going to nicely
complement our leading positions in, for example, LDI, active fixed income, global thematic equity as well as
private credit. In wealth management, client acquisition has started to pick up again with the resumption of
socially distance in-person meetings. We're investing in talent, initiatives such as strengthening our family office
offering and technology and digital tools to support advisers and their clients.
We often speak about the importance of controlling expenses. This is especially critical in this low rate
environment. We continue to identify opportunities to improve automation through operational enhancements. Our
approach in deciding between reinvesting expense savings and allowing them to fall to the bottom line is based
on a rigorous analysis, including investments and prioritizing them, the ones with the most attractive ROIs as well
as taking a careful look at their payback periods.
We're also assessing the long-term structural opportunities from this current work environment. There's no
question we're going to have a meaningful impact on how we work in the future, and we'll need to be agile. We
expect it will impact our real estate footprint, our location strategy, the need for contingency sites, marketing and
business development and acceleration of our digitization efforts with our clients.
Now building a scalable and resilient operating model is a core part of our strategy. It will enable us to optimize
and streamline the interactions across our businesses, technology and operations, all in the interest of serving
clients and driving growth. Now to drive and advance that agenda more rapidly, we recently made the decision to
bring operations and technology together under Bridget Engle's leadership by more directly connecting operations
and technology into a single operating model.
We're taking a holistic approach to bring together the best of both functions. And I think it's going to give us the
ability to share enterprise capabilities, prioritize investments, reengineer and digitize processes more quickly to
drive scale and agility as well as to embed innovation and automation across end-to-end client journeys and
create more agile client-centric teams.

Now let me turn to capital returns. On September 17, the Federal Reserve released scenarios for a second round
of bank stress test and that was followed by a September 30 announcement that share buyback and dividend
increase restrictions have been extended for the fourth quarter. We are now working through the analysis and the
modeling as we're given 45 days from the data receipt of the scenarios to submit our plan. We continue to believe
that our low-risk and highly capital-generative model positions us very well through this test.
We will commence buybacks as soon as possible with the decision to be informed by the economic and
regulatory environment at the time as well as the outcome of the resubmitted capital plans based on the new
scenarios. In the meantime, we continue to accrete significant amounts of capital. The stress capital buffer, I'll just
remind you, gives us flexibility in terms of capital return timing, and so it is a matter of when and not a matter of if.
As a reminder, we also opportunistically issued $1 billion in preferred stock during the second quarter, and that
will provide us with the opportunity to restack our capital once we can recommence buybacks. We are committed
to attractive levels of shareholder returns, and we continue to aim to return at least 100% of earnings to
shareholders over time.
Before I conclude my comments, I want to welcome Robin Vince, who has just joined us as Vice Chairman of
BNY Mellon and CEO of Global Market Infrastructure, with oversight of Clearance and Collateral Management,
Treasury Services, Markets and Pershing.
Bringing these complementary businesses together under his experienced leadership will better position us to
become the central facilitator in our clients' capital markets ecosystems across markets, asset classes and
geographies.
I'm excited to have Robin with us. He's an accomplished and respected leader in the industry, who has held a
number of leadership positions at Goldman Sachs, including serving as their Chief Risk Officer, Treasurer, Head
of Operations; Head of Global Money Markets and CEO of the International Bank.
I'm also very pleased with how the leadership team has come together. It's a highly talented, energized and
diverse group that is willing to truly challenge each other to make us all stronger.
To wrap up, while uncertainty certainly lies in terms of how the pandemic evolves and its impact on the global
economy, we have also a significant uncertainty about the size and form of future stimulus programs as well as
political developments. But given that, I am certain that the team we have in place will continue to navigate these
challenges by executing on our strategic priorities.
I am also proud that our employees across the company have worked diligently throughout this unprecedented
time to provide great client service. We entered this crisis from a position of strength and have an unwavering
focus on building ever greater value for our stakeholders going forward.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Emily.

results for the quarter. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Beginning on page two of the financial highlights document, in the third quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of
$3.85 billion, down less than 1%, and EPS of $0.98. As expected, revenues were negatively impacted by low
interest rates and associated money market fee waivers. Excluding these market-driven factors, underlying fees
would have been up, reflecting good momentum across many of our businesses.
Expenses were up 4%. However, it is important to note that 3% of the increase was driven by the tax-related
reserve release in the third quarter of 2019. Pre-tax margin was 30%, and we posted ROTCE of 16.7% and ROE
of 8.7%. Provision for credit losses was $9 million.
We continue to accrete substantial excess capital and are in a good position to resume buybacks when regulators
and market conditions allow. Quarter-over-quarter, both our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios improved
meaningfully by 40 and 30 basis points, respectively.
Page 3 sets out a trend analysis of the main drivers of the quarterly results. Investment services revenue was
$2.9 billion, down 4%. Net interest revenue was down 11% while fees were down 2%, including the impact of
money market fee waivers. We saw a healthy underlying growth across asset servicing, Pershing, treasury
services and corporate trust, which I will discuss later.
Investment and wealth management revenue increased 3%, largely driven by higher market values. And we also
continue to see strong investment performance in our largest strategies with positive long-term flows this quarter.
The impact of money market fee waivers on our consolidated fee revenue, net of distribution and servicing
expense, was $101 million in the quarter, slightly better than the $110 million to $125 million that we previously
guided to, and an increase of $22 million quarter-on-quarter. We provided you detail of the impact by business
and the expense in the appendix of this highlights deck.
Finally, despite the contraction in high margin revenues this year from lower interest rates and more recently, the
absence of share buybacks, pre-tax income, margins and EPS are healthy, although down versus a year ago.
Slide 4 summarizes the P&L and notable items in the year ago period. There were two largely offsetting items, but
relevant, as we look at various components of the P&L. One is the lease impairment negatively impacting NIR in
the third quarter of 2019 and the other is a net reduction of reserves that benefited IM expense in the prior year
quarter.
Turning to slide 5. Our capital and liquidity ratios remain strong and well above internal targets and regulatory
minimums. Common Equity Tier 1 capital totaled just over $21 billion at September 30, and our CET1 ratio was
13% under the advanced approach and 13.5% under the standardized approach. As a reminder, under the new
stress capital buffer rules that became effective October 1, we are required to maintain a standardized CET1 ratio
of 8.5%, including the 2.5% stress capital buffer floor and a 1.5% G-SIB surcharge.
Tier 1 leverage is currently our binding constraint due to the buffers we need to hold for potential growth in our
deposit base-driven balance sheet. We are comfortable operating at a ratio of around 5.5% to 6% versus the 4%
regulatory minimum. At 6.5%, our current Tier 1 leverage ratio is well above our target, and we expect to accrete
more capital in the fourth quarter. Finally, our average LCR in the third quarter was 111%.
In terms of shareholder capital return, in the third quarter, we continued our suspension of share repurchases and
will do so again in the fourth quarter in line with Federal Reserve restrictions for CCAR banks. We continued to

pay our quarterly cash dividend, which totaled $279 million [audio gap] (00:18:47) and believe we have ample
capacity to continue to pay dividends under a variety of economic scenarios.
Turning to page 6. My comments on net interest revenue will highlight the sequential changes. Net interest
revenue of $703 million was down 10%. This was within the range we provided for the second quarter results
despite rates coming in a little lower than was implied by the forward curve at the time. We offset some of this
impact through implementation of balance sheet optimization strategies.
A full quarter of lower LIBOR as well as lower rates in general reduced the yield on securities portfolio, loans and
other interest-earning assets. For example, average one and three-month LIBOR levels were down 20 bps and 36
bps, respectively. The lower asset yield impact was partially offset by the related benefits of lower funding costs.
The rate environment also drove MBS prepayment activity slightly higher-than-expected for the quarter. As I said,
we were able to offset some of the rate headwinds through the deployment of cash into a larger securities
portfolio, as more of our deposit balances seasoned. Additionally, we benefited from a decline in long-term debt
outstanding.
Turning to slide 7, which summarizes deposits and securities trends. Average deposit balance has remained
strong at $279 billion, up 23% versus the third quarter of 2019. Deposit growth reflects the success of our deposit
initiatives linked to fee-generating transaction activities that we've had in place for a year now across treasury
services, asset servicing and wealth management. It is also partly attributable to central bank balance sheet
expansion, which results in excess liquidity in the system.
The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits declined very modestly to negative 5 basis points during the
quarter and reflected some pricing optimization in a few businesses. At this point, we generally feel that we've
now reached the low point for deposit pricing. Recall that the negative rate paid reflects our business mix.
Approximately 25% of our deposits are non-US dollar and we charge negative rates on euro-denominated
deposits.
Turning to the securities portfolio. On average, the portfolio increased approximately $9 billion versus the second
quarter and was around $37 billion over the prior year or nearly 30% higher as we deployed the growing deposit
base. Average non-HQLA securities, including trading assets, were $33 billion in the third quarter, up from $22
billion a year ago, as we've been buying some incremental non-HQLA securities to increase yields, while
maintaining our conservative risk profile.
Moving to page 8, which provides some color on our asset mix and our loan portfolio. Our average interest-
earning assets were relatively stable at $358 billion. But as I mentioned, we did redeploy some cash into
investment securities this quarter. The loan portfolio represents just 15% of our interest-earning assets.
We continue to feel good about our credit exposures and the portfolio continues to perform well. So at zero net
charge-offs this year, we will continue to closely monitor the portfolio, particularly their commercial real estate
exposure and other sectors more acutely impacted by the current environment. Provision for credit losses
reflected a fairly consistent macroeconomic outlook versus the prior quarter and a modest net uptick in reserves
primarily related to our CRE portfolio.
Page 9 provides an overview of expenses. Expenses of $2.7 billion were up 4%. 3% of the increase was driven
by the tax-related reserve reduction last year in investment management. The remainder of the increase was the

result of continued investments in technology and the impact of a weaker US dollar, partially offset by lower staff
and business development expenses, namely travel and marketing.
Turning to Page 10. Total investment services revenue declined 4%, as almost all business revenue growth rates
were impacted by year-over-year lower net interest revenue. Assets under custody and/or administration
increased 8% year-over-year to $38.6 trillion, and we continue to see organic growth with new and existing
clients, as well as the benefit from higher market values and the impact of a weaker US dollar.
As I move to the business line discussion, I will focus my comments on fees. Within asset servicing, overall fees
increased slightly, primarily on organic growth with existing clients and higher market levels. These increases
were partially offset by lower securities lending revenue due to tighter spreads as well as marginally lower foreign
exchange revenue on the back of lower industry volumes despite higher volatility in FX markets. Other trading
revenue was down driven by fixed income trading activities, which is offset in NIR.
In Pershing, fee revenue decreased as the impact of fee waivers more than offset good organic growth.
Transaction volumes, clearing accounts, mutual fund assets and sweep balances all increased and net new
assets were $12 billion in the quarter. Year-to-date, the pipeline has further improved as the business continues
to gain momentum.
Issuer services fees revenue decreased by 9%, driven by depository receipts based on a slowdown in cross-
border settlement, as well as seasonal dividend and other corporate action activity due to macro uncertainty.
Trends in DR masked good underlying momentum in corporate trust, as demonstrated by new business wins and
client deposit growth and corporate trust fees were modestly higher.
Treasury service and fee revenue was up 9% despite the tough macroeconomic environment and lower overall
payment activity, primarily due to higher liquidity balances, which grew over 45% year-over-year net new business
and an improvement in product mix.
Clearance and collateral management fees were impacted by lower revenue of $12 million driven by the
divestiture of its equity investment in the fourth quarter of last year, as well as the subdued activity in the US
Treasury market despite higher issuance levels and secondary trading and therefore settlement activity was
lower. These headwinds were partially offset by higher non-US dollar collateral management fees.
Page 11 summarizes the drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of our investment
services businesses.
Turning to investment and wealth management on page 12. Total investment and wealth management revenue
was up 3%. Overall assets under management of $2 trillion are up 9% year-over-year, primarily due to higher
markets, the impact of the US dollar weakening and cash inflows from earlier this year. We had net outflows of $5
billion in the quarter. The long-term strategy had been inflows of $5 billion, including significant LDI inflows from
targeted clients.
Investment management revenue was up 5% driven mainly by higher market values, the favorable impact of a
weaker US dollar and uptick in performance fees and the absence of the impact of hedging activity that occurred
a year ago. This offset higher money market fee waivers.
Wealth management revenue was down 1% year-over-year, while fees were flat and higher market levels were
offset by net outflows partially due to client tax payments and a shift by clients to lower fee investment products.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
In the quarter, there were $21 million of seed capital hedging losses that were more than offset by gains on seed
capital. The net of these items was reflected in other fee revenue within the segment.
As a reminder, in the consolidated financial statements, the results of the seed capital hedges are in foreign
exchange and other trading and the seed capital gains are reflected in income from consolidated investment
management funds and investment and other income. In the third quarter last year, there was also a revenue
hedge in one of the investment management boutiques, which has been eliminated.
Now turning to our other segment on page 13. The year-over-year revenue comparison was primarily impacted by
the lease related impairments of $70 million recorded in the third quarter of last year, while expenses declined
primarily due to lower staff expense.
And now a few comments about the fourth quarter. First, I would note that the macroeconomic environment
remains fluid. Although we are expecting higher volatility in the fourth quarter around the elections, it is difficult to
predict whether this will translate into higher transaction volumes, or whether it will be a risk off environment.
Looking ahead, at net interest revenue, we expect NIRs decline sequentially by 3% to 5%. As we look into next
year, we expect the quarterly NIR run rate to be slightly less than the fourth quarter level. This is based on a few
factors.
First, the forward curve indicates a fairly stable rate environment from here, implying that the work should be
behind us. Second, we continue to take action and optimize the securities and loan portfolio, as the positive
season, generating marginally higher yield.
Third, the unrealized gains associated with the higher yielding long-term securities will take some time to roll off.
Fourth, we do not expect further deleveraging. And additionally, our deposit balances remained strong and are
slightly higher than the third quarter average. We expect them to remain at these levels.
In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect money market fee waivers, net of distribution expense benefits to
being the original range indicated at $135 to $150 million. As we look into the next year, we expect waivers to be
fully incorporated into our run rate at the higher end of that range.
Waivers will also start to impact investment services businesses, aside from Pershing, to a greater extent. And on
full year expenses excluding notable items, we expect this to remain essentially flat versus 2019, including the 50
basis points all year-over-year impact from higher pension expense.
We maybe up slightly if there is a weakening of the US dollar but this of course would be largely offset on the
revenue line which would benefit from a weakening US dollar. Credit costs will be highly dependent upon
individual credits and other macroeconomic development. In terms of our effective tax rate, we still expect to be
approximately 20% for the full year, although it was lower this quarter.
With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instruction] We will take our first question comes from Alex Blostein with
Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Good morning. Thanks, Todd and welcome Emily. So, first question for you guys, I was hoping to go back
to opening comments around how the challenging rate backdrop and obviously market challenge in the beginning
of the year, perhaps masking some of the growth initiatives that are taking place underneath.
It sounds like Todd, you're a little bit more optimistic about that into next year. So can you help us contextualize,
which specific initiatives from a top-line perspective, you expect to be the most material contributors to certain top-
line growth into 2021?
And over time, again given numerous things you mentioned. Where do you see is a reasonable organic fee
growth for the firm excluding sort of the market dynamics?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure, Alex. Good morning. Good to hear from you. I think probably the most impactful one is around Pershing.
And so, and we did call out the details around Pershing, so as we've been investing in the advisory space and we
are seeing some good growth and some good wins there. Yeah, we saw on a year-over-year basis, a decline in
fees. But there's about $73 million of fee waivers that are reflected there, so if you adjust for that there is actually
pretty healthy growth.
So we continue to see that as a potential upside, and it'll be good to get these fee waivers behind us, because the
masking of what's lying underneath, will go away. I think secondly, in asset servicing, we're seeing the same
effect where we're starting to see a little bit of fee waivers obviously we're seeing a lot of net interest income
impact. And there's a little bit of other noise, I mean, we had divested of an asset that was driving that fee line a
year ago.
We took a big gain in the fourth quarter, but there was some income related to that that we would have enjoyed in
the third quarter that's no longer there. But when we look at what we see going on there. We do see some traction
around our data and analytics space, we – I mean one – and also one of the important things there and one of our
key strategies is quality of service. And the quality of our service and the feedback that we're getting from clients
continues to improve. It helps not only the retention of business, but new business especially with existing clients
and we're starting to see that come through the line and a bit of that is masked.
On the clearing and collateral management space, where we're making significant investments and what we're
calling the future of collateral, which will make that business much more interoperable and beneficial to our
clients. We see some growth opportunities. This particular quarter was pretty soft for that. I mean, again, we had
divested of an asset that was reflected in that line. We also – and this is kind of surprising just the clearing of
volumes in the treasury market despite the massive increases in issuance by the US government, they were

clearing business in particular. We saw a very modest increase in global collateral. But domestic collateral
management was down a little bit as we saw some deleveraging.
So there are a number of things masking that, I think we'll be able to pick up market share in the future. And I
think we'll also be able to pick up a movement from bilateral to tri-party, because of the efficiencies that they're
going to get on our platform. So I think those are a couple of the key points.

Got it. And I guess, just putting it all together and not to pinpoint 2021 or 2022 as you think about the collection of

Thomas P. Gibbons A

Yeah. I don't think I want to put down on to guidance at this point, but when we look to this year, there's a modest
amount 1% or 2% underlying kind of organic fee growth, a lot of it masked by all those things I just described.

Todd, you mentioned the buyback when the gates are lifted from the Fed. And I just wanted to understand, how
quickly you would be willing to buyback the stock down to the Tier 1 leverage ratio of what I think it's 6% that
you're using as your self imposed minimum there?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Well, first of all, we'd like to get started as – obviously as soon as we can. The guidance that that Emily gave is –
as a target and right now our constraint is the Tier 1 leverage ratio as we go through the stress test that's
historically what it's been. And we gave guidance that we think we should target somewhere between the 5.5%
and 6% range. And we're currently at 6.5% and growing.
That being said, the reason we give guidance in that range is right now our – as you know, our balance sheet is a
bit bloated because of all of the liquidity that the Fed has put in place. So in this kind of environment where we've
already felt the sharp increase in deposits they come with the market environment, we wouldn't expect another
course of that, so we probably be willing to move toward the middle or lower end of that target. So that being said,
we'll have to look at market conditions at the time when the Fed lifted the restrictions, see what the economy is
doing, what we think is going on with the balance sheet and we'd absolutely be willing to start moving
aggressively.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So if there was another fiscal plan that came through that doesn't really impact your deposits obviously as
much as the Fed and increasing the size of the balance sheet. So another round of fiscal stimulus doesn't really
drive up your deposits, you don't have to worry about that too much is that one of the takeaways there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
I think that's right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Okay, thanks. And then on the follow-up question just on how we're thinking about reinvesting the cash you
have on the balance sheet, maybe Emily you can speak to how you're thinking about redeploying that into
securities? You talked about having NIM next year or I should say NII next year be running at a little bit less than
the 4Q run rate. So I'm expecting that some of that cash redeployment will be occurring maybe if you give us
some color as to how you're thinking about that, the pace and how much of your cash you are willing to redeploy
into securities?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. Good to hear from you, Betsy. Ultimately, we have been talking about for some time, we have been looking
to redeploy the excess cash that we have and of course as deposits do begin to season, we have an ability to do
that. We have been increasing the amount of high quality non-HQLA in the portfolio on a – marginally quarter-on-
quarter, and actually year-over-year, that's up about $10 billion. And so it's a mixture of growing the portfolio,
investing in growing the non-HQLA around the edges, extending duration and the only other thing I would say is
we – it's not just about the securities portfolio, but it's also about the loan portfolio. So we are redeploying some of
our deposits into our loan portfolio which of course also helps with client services and in client relationships.

Operator: We will take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks. Just a follow-up on a capital and Todd, we've talked about this a little bit in the past, but I get it, you
got tons and you keep making more and the buybacks awfully enticing and accretive. I'm curious on how you
guys balance that with the potential to deploy capital into something else that could accelerate growth and/or
improve the overall mix of the company? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yes. Okay, Glenn, yeah thanks for the question. We're constantly looking at what opportunities lie out there for us.
And we take – and what I'd say Glenn is we take a very careful look at it, and I think very disciplined approach to
how we would look at something inorganic. We're certainly not opposed to it. From time-to-time, we see certain
types of actions and lift outs that might make some sense to us. But frankly, we compare them to a capital return,
and they should be able to be the long-term EPS growth that we'd otherwise get buying back our shares, so we
hold ourselves very strictly to that discipline.
There may be – and we did things through the financial crisis, there may be opportunities here to do something.
We've got a team that's constantly evaluating, whether it's in the FinTech space, whether it's extending a market,
whether it's doing something and adjacency to what we're currently looking at. So we're absolutely willing to
consider things, but they have to make sense for the long-term growth of the company.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. I appreciate that. Maybe just one quickie on issuer services, which I know it's hard with the crystal ball, but
we've had a big surge in debt issuance this year. I'm curious on how you think about just the overall business
growth going into next year. What you see as pulled forward versus just a still good issuing environment? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So in our issuer services, we've actually got two businesses in that segment. We've got the corporate trust
business which you're referring to, but we also have the DR, the Depositary Receipt business. The DR business
was, as you might expect was quite a bit softer. A lot of that is international. It related to international equities,
obviously. And the volume and dividends and the action there was down. So we generate a lot of revenue off of
the corporate actions in the third quarters, typically a pretty good quarter. It was still up sequentially, but it was
down substantially year-over-year, so that kind of masks the underlying performance of corporate trust.
We think corporate trust continues to – we picked up a little bit of market share in some of the core businesses.
Frankly, we had lost our mojo a couple of years ago and I think we've gotten it back and we're seeing some
growth there. And the opportunity – and the issuance that has taken place, has been significant. It's not the
highest yielding type of issuance, but as we start to see some more structured product and the credit product
come back, we think we're well positioned to capture that growth.
There's a little – this is another one of the businesses that does – is impacted by fee waivers. So, a little bit of that
will be masked by fee waivers over the next quarter or two. And that's why in my opening remarks I said, I'm
looking forward to getting that [ph] reset (00:42:38) done having the fee waivers fully priced into the run rate, as

well as the lower interest rates and our net interest income, and we expect to see that probably sometime early
next year.

Operator: We will take our next question from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. First, just given the net interest revenue and waiver
pressures, just curious if there's any other efficiency initiatives across the board to reduce expenses heading into
2021, despite some of the investments that you guys talk about making for the business to drive growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
I'll take that. So, yes, we do have many efficiency initiatives that are actually ongoing. And ultimately, whether it is
– and I think we've talked in previous forums, whether it's investments that we've made in terms of automating
client inquiries, hands-free NAV and various other initiatives. Those are all things that are coming. Look, we do
expect – they already are coming through our cost line, the benefit, and they will continue to come through the
cost line.
The other thing I would just say is that in this year, we probably – not probably, we reached our peak of
investment in resiliency. That doesn't mean we're going to stop investing. We will continue to invest in resiliency
but we reached the peak investment. So that will abate a bit and give us some room.
And likewise, we have, ultimately, various different initiatives across the business from a structural perspective as
we're looking at the potential permanent impact of COVID on real estate footprint as well as sales and marketing
expenses, and other digitization efforts that are accelerating with our clients.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Mike, if I could add to that. One of the things that we did in the quarter is I named Bridget Engle, Head of
Tech and Ops. She was previously Head of Technology. And by bringing Tech and Ops together, and Ops covers
most of the operations of the company, I think the opportunity to automate, to work more closely together, to really
target where we're going to invest in our automation process.
We still do – there's still lots of low-lying fruit on that tree, because we still do – unfortunately, have a lot of manual
processes, things that we can do more efficiently. So by putting Tech and Ops together, and Bridget Engle
working with our Head of Operations, Ann Fogarty, that much more closely, I think we'll be able to identify and
execute more quickly on some of these efficiencies.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
I mean we've been moving pretty well, it's basically funded the significant increase in our technology expenses
over the last few years. We do think those increases are going to abate. They're not going to be at the same rate,
it's probably been at a 10% compounded annual growth rate for a number of years here. And so, that puts us in a
position to keep grinding through it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
All right. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up. Given some of the noise with the waivers and [ph] even
(00:46:01) volatility levels throughout the year, just curious how pricing has been trending in asset servicing over
the past six or so months. And then just in terms of going forward, any expected changes or any expected kind of
surges in [ph] your (00:46:16) contract negotiations that could move it one way or another.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure, Mike, I'll take that. Obviously, asset servicing is a pretty mature business, so repricing is just a continual
headwind, although it's pretty modest. And we have not seen a change in the amount, really, from a percentage
basis and impact on revenues for several years. So it's not any worse than it has been. As you do rightfully point
out, though, it is lumpy. And as bigger contracts do come up for renewal, that can be lumpy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
...yeah, the pipeline is strong. And when we look at the pipeline, a very high percentage of them now, I think over
20% of it is looking at our data and analytics offerings. So we're really starting to see that pick up. And if you look
at – I mean, I think the best way to evaluate the business is from the operating margins. And the operating
margins aren't under pressure because of pricing, they're under pressure because of the cyclical nature of interest
rates in that business.

control. You mentioned once interest rates settle down, we'll see some more of the benefits. You guided for lower

NII ahead though. So the first question is when do you think that you'll see the full negative impact of interest
rates in the run rate so we can see the underlying progress come through? And then I'll ask a second question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Go ahead, Emily.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. Mike, good to hear from you. So look, I'm not going to try to call the market or the timing on the trough in
rates. But as we did just guide in our prepared remarks, we think that the fourth quarter NIR will probably be
anywhere from 3% to 5% down from this quarter. And ultimately, we do think it's probably a pretty good estimate
to use slightly lower than what the fourth quarter's meant to be or what we expect it to be to project out the rest of
next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So basically, we're saying, Mike, that's something slightly under the fourth quarter run rate. But that's making the
assumption that the forward yield curve is reflected in what actually happens.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
And just to add to that...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So no improvement in rates. It just reflects where the market is today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Exactly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. There's only so much you can do about that, I guess. But on the other question, assets under custody,
you're up 8% year-over-year and your investment servicing revenues are down 4% year-over-year. And this is not
a new issue for you or any of these trust banks but how can you grow the investment servicing business while
also growing investment servicing revenues?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
You mentioned, Todd, you've gained share in the trust business but there seems to be a disconnect between
AUC growth and the revenues related to that. Is that just competition? And can you change your fee model or
how you charge your customers? It seems like your customers are getting the better end of the arrangement.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Sometimes it feels that way. There's a little bit of noise, Mike, in that line. And in the – when we look at the
asset servicing fees in the corporate line rather than in the segment, that reflects the clearing and collateral
management business as well. And the clearing and collateral management business in the third quarter didn't
have a very good quarter.
I think there was a divestiture that took place and we lost a significant amount of revenue there. But the activity
was actually pretty depressed in the quarter, which is kind of a surprise because even though the US
government's issuing a significant amount of additional treasuries, the actual trading around that was a little bit
less than we would have anticipated and there were some other impacts there.
The other thing in that line is securities lending. And securities lending, again, volumes are up, that's another
interest rate and market-related issue. The reinvestment rates are significantly down. So the spreads are down.
And we didn't see many things in the way of special, so there is a little bit of the deleveraging. So if you adjust for
that, we don't see anything substantially different in the pricing or the operating margins – underlying operating
margins, except for some of the cyclical effects that I just pointed out.
That being said, it puts us in a position, should we price to assume that those cyclical pressures are going to
remain forever or should we price maintaining the optionality that we're going to have on the upside. And
competition will help us drive that but we're going to do what we think will be in the long-term interest with those
clients.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. I guess that leads to why you're putting so much effort on the efficiency. I mean, we don't have the earnings
from investment servicing, you don't break it out to that detail. But we still get – even after adjusting for securities
lending and these other factors, there's still – AUC is growing faster than the revenues from it, right, and so that's
why you're trying to improve efficiency. Anything about earnings related to that business? Is it keeping pace?
Because, again, we don't have it at that level and that's a core function of what you guys do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. No, I think we – it's a meaningful contributor to the overall performance of the company. I think we are
continuing to get more efficient. But we also have some other investments that we think that we can expand the
revenue stream as we provide more capabilities around data management. For example, we're starting to see a
little bit of traction there. Some of the applications I described one on the – in my earlier remarks, where we've got
an ESG app that I think is really starting to gain some traction. We've got 12 clients now operating on it. We've got
maybe 100 demos that we've given, very good tick-up on that.
We have another app on distribution analytics, which I think, can really help our clients increase their distribution
and that's how you really build out relationships. So there's things that we're trying to generate more revenues as

we take on more of the operational burden from our clients. But at the same time, we are – the throughput is
going up without significant increases in costs. So yes, we are driving down our per unit cost meaningfully.

Operator: We will take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow-up on NII. Emily, thank you for providing –
taking a stab at 2021 and appreciate that you're using the forward curve. So, just was curious about what
assumptions are also embedded for MBS prepayment activity in that? It seems as though more recently that was
a bit of a surprise versus some of maybe what the third-party data sources had been expecting? Are you
expecting that that will continue to accelerate?
And then when you talk about the lending and some balance sheet optimization into lending, is that on the margin
loan side or is that elsewhere? Because it looks like the margin loan yield is holding up better than the prior
reserve period. So curious if that's sustainable? Is that some mix or some color on that front? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. Sure. I'll try to take both of those. In terms of MBS prepayments, just for what it's worth, they accelerated
about 5% more than we originally expected and that is part of the headwind on NIR at least in the third quarter. In
terms of as we think about – as we go through next year, we do expect it to slow modestly. So that's in our
projection.
And then, I guess, in terms of your question with regard to lending, we actually – at the minute, our lending
portfolio is relatively flat at $55 billion. You'll see probably growth in that as we get into next year, again, more
marginally. We don't lead with lending. It's certainly something that we do to strengthen relationships that we have
with our clients. And the places where we really see a lot of – or some opportunities in the 40 Act lending space,
well basically mortgages in wealth and also supply trade finance in treasury services.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. And I would add to that, Brennan, that interestingly, in the big drawdowns that we had on the corporate
committed facilities, 70% of those have been paid back. So we've seen that loan part of the loan portfolio go
down. So I think that's kind of the noise associated with that. That's been stabilized. But we would like to continue
to grow and we'll do it prudently. The margin lending business, it's a very low risk. It's a decent return. We'd like to
see some more 40 Act lending, which is something that looks akin to that as well as the supply chain and
mortgages and wealth that we talked about.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
All right. That's really helpful. Thanks for that color. And then when we think of like – taking a step back here,
rates are tough and clearly more environmental than something that specifically you guys are doing. But a big part
of your economic model is embedded within rates because of the deposit spreads embedded within your – the
returns that you generate from your clients. And so this period feels sort of different than when we went into the
last one. The last one was viewed as temporary. It's just something we need to get through and then we're going
to come out on the other side and we'll return to a "normal environment" and that position has come under a
pretty significant question.
So I guess, what I would say is, what are you – how are you thinking about making adjustments to the pricing
model? How are you thinking about reconsidering some of the economic considerations when you assess clients?
And what are your assumptions for where deposit spreads would return to just to ensure that the new business
that you win, the assessment of existing relationships remains reasonably calibrated to what is the likely
environment, unfortunately, we're going to be in for a while. I know it's a tough one, but just curious your thoughts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. So yeah, I think that the general feeling and ours is as well is that rates are lower for longer. By the way,
the last cycle, they were low for a fairly substantial period of time. That being said, we see the light at the end of
the tunnel for the fully baked in impact of interest rates today and it's from there that we'll grow. So we will take
into consideration what the market implies in interest rates as we price activity going forward and that's reflected
in all of our pricing assumptions.
And we've also got a whole series of initiatives that we think will give us deeper relationships and add revenue
streams as we look there out. So we do see the potential for some margin expansion. We see the potential for
some revenue growth. We see the benefits of our operating efficiencies. It really just points back to our key
priorities. There's a handful of organic growth initiatives that we've got in place. They're not all going to pay out,
but some of them will.
And the activity levels are still high. What we do is important. And it's growing. I mean if you look at the Pershing
marketplace, the advisory business is growing rapidly. And we think we can capture more of that.
There's been a consolidation amongst custodians. That's an interesting opportunity for us. So it's [ph] not always
with us (00:59:35). We understand we've got an interest rate headwind. We want to get it behind us and move off
a bit. And grow the company from there.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Maybe going into Pershing, picking off, starting with that last – with your last answer, Todd, within that
opportunity, within the RIA custodian space, is – first of all, I missed one number you've quoted earlier. I don't
know if it was the $12 billion of net new assets in that business, but if it's something different, if you could repeat
that?
And then the question really is more of the opportunity going forward on that, I guess the timeline of it, are you –
have you benefited from that significantly already? Or do you think that we're in the early innings of the RIA
market share gain there? And are you doing anything differently than you had in the past in that business to try to
win that business from the other custodians?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. No, your number was correct. And yes, we are investing more significantly in the business. We're investing
in both sales, marketing as well as the platform that supports the advisory business.
And we've got plans to do more and to continue capturing market share. We're doing – the pipeline is strong.
There's another space there that I really didn't even mention and that is institutional clearing. It's something that
we're uniquely positioned to do.
And we're seeing more and more as even bigger broker-dealers look to outsource, trying to reduce some of the
capital requirements and balance sheet requirements as well as just gaining efficiencies. And the connectivity that
Pershing has to our own clearing and collateral and tri-party business is a unique offering. So we see
opportunities there as well.

And so is there some confidence that you can outweigh the fee waivers in that segment over the next few
quarters potentially from the organic growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
It's going to be difficult in the short-term. That's why I want to get them behind us. As I just indicated, Brian, on a
year-over-year basis, that fee waiver was $74 million in the quarter – $73 million in the quarter for Pershing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Yeah. That makes sense. And then your comments on the data offering, 20% of the pipeline. Can you just talk
about the role of Aladdin within that? I know you've integrated that into some of the servicing [ph] pricing
(01:02:36). And you also mentioned the ESG app, that's obviously starting, still in early phase.
But maybe if you can talk about, what you're doing there. Is that aggregating data from the other ESG services?
Or are you actually putting a proprietary analytical engine on the ESG that might generate some additional
growth? And are you beginning to charge for that yet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. So Brian, let me focus on the ESG app first. So it's a little bit of both. So basically, the client brings the
license to us. So we have integrated, or we'll connect to as many as 100 different ESG data providers. And we've
built a whole – we'll use the United Nation's factors, or we'll also kind of customize factors that are most frequently
used.
And so you can run your own analytics against those factors. Probably the neatest thing that we've done against it
is we built a crowdsourcing app as well. So there's a sharing of which factors, which data suppliers appear to be
the most trusted. And it also shows you how much data there is on each of the factors that you're looking at. So,
whether you can even trust that factor or not and when there's a lack of information or the quality of information is
challenged by the crowd, we're feeding that information back to the data providers, so they can constantly
improve it. So we think it's pretty innovative. It's – and the – we're agnostic to where the data is. They can feed it
to us, if we're the custodian. We can flip the switch and turn it on for them. So that's the – that particular app. Do
you have anything to add, Emily?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Can I take the OMS side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. Go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So we've actually seen a very nice uptick in terms of – or tick up, I should say, in terms of our partnerships with
the various OMSs. And by the way, just as a reminder, it's not just Aladdin, but we have a partnership with
Bloomberg, Simcorp, CRD as well as SS&C. So we're really about open architecture. And we think that our
integration is more robust. We truly have integrated through single sign-on and the data feeds, also across more
asset classes. And ultimately, it's not only beneficial to us, but it's also beneficial to those service providers. And
the last thing, I would just mention about open architecture, it's not just about the front end, it's actually about –
throughout the entire life cycle, the investment life cycle. So we've got also agreements and partnerships with
many FinTechs; EZOPS, Milestone, Kingfield and others.

Operator: We will take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Todd, you mentioned earlier that a couple of the businesses
were just kind of quiet this quarter. I wanted to ask you just a bigger question when you think across the
businesses, the activity-driven businesses versus the really strong first quarter things have kind of settled down.
Do you get a – you get a sense that we kind of are now at normal levels of activity when you think across the
more transactional parts of the company? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Ken. So I said the answer to that is yes. And I'd also say, the third quarter was, I mean, typically, it's a
little bit of a seasonal quarter to slow down into vacation. We actually saw that this quarter. And versus a year
ago, where you had the blip in the repo markets and some unusual things and some unusual revenues related to
that. We didn't see – this looked more like the seasonality that we would typically see in the quarter. So it feels, at
least for the time being that there is a level of normalcy around the volumes and activity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And a follow-up on the buyback, Todd, loud and clear that you're ready to go. Would there be anything if
the Fed were to lift the buyback restriction after 4Q. Is it just onto your own decisioning from there? Is there
anything either politically or regulatory that could get in the way of you guys just ready to plough back into the
buyback and related how would you start to think about if you were able to get back in? Do you go right back to
buying back 100% total capital return or do you have to kind of leg in? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yes. So, I mean, one of the benefits of the new regime, once it gets fully implemented, the stressed capital buffer,
it's no longer a program where we submit a plan with X amount of buybacks by period. And if we vary from that
plan, we have to make an adjustment or a resubmission. It is we have to maintain our stress capital buffer. And so
we're not restricted by timing and the implications of that. So we actually – we think it's a very logical approach
and we look forward to operating within it because I think it gives us more of the agility that you're pointing to
there, Ken.
Now in terms of [indiscernible] (01:08:00) consequences or we're – I mean that's really outside of our control. The
Fed is meant to be an apolitical institution. And I think they will go through the stress test. They'll make their
assessments and they will determine what actions they are going to permit.

Operator: We will take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Morning, Steven.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So I wanted to start off with a question on capital. Emily, I appreciate you drawing a line in the sand, outlining the
roughly 50 bps to 100 bps of excess Tier 1 leverage you have today. Admittedly, like when we start to run various
scenarios in terms of significant deposit uplift. And if there is like a negative market shock that we ultimately
experience, that 5.5% to 6% target, it still feels quite conservative. And just wanted to get some context as to why
you feel that's the appropriate level that you need to manage to? And how could that potentially evolve over time if
you find that the deposits prove to be stickier and the balance sheet volatility ultimately proves to be less as the
COVID pressure starts to abate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. I can take that, and Todd, you can add if you want. In terms of – just worth mentioning from a deposit
perspective, our deposits are trending about 3% up from where they were in the second quarter. So there – that
just...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
In the third quarter.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
...sorry, in the third quarter, apologies. In the third quarter, they're currently around 3% up. And ultimately, when it
comes to just thinking about the Tier 1 leverage, you are correct, it is our binding constraint. Having said that, we
have done very well on all of our stress tests which have taken into account very severe market shocks. And we
do feel that the buffer that we've talked about is certainly sufficient. And you are correct that we're running above
that. And as a result, our excess – certainly excess capital to make others – an additional surge in deposits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I'd add to that, Steven. It's a – when you look at your capital ratios, you have to look at them kind of BAU
and current operating conditions. So we've got a massive excess relative to that. And if you – and to your point, is
it more stable, well, we've already gotten a significant uptick due to the activities coming out of the Fed. And fiscal
is probably not going to have anything like that to the underlying deposit base. So we're really positioned to
handle growth, but we also have to run it through the stress test. So it's not just normal business conditions put
through stress. That Tier 1 leverage ratio could be a constraint and that's what we're pointing out. So the buffer
reflects both what could be an increase in the deposits for any particular sharp upturn as well as what we need
just to meet – to run a traditional stress test.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks for all that color. And just one follow-up from me regarding some of the discussion regarding some of the
organic fee green shoots that were cited earlier and over the last couple of years, PPNR has contracted. It's
almost been exclusively driven by NII and interest rate pressures. Core fees have been running flattish. Expenses
have also been running flattish and you've tried to maintain discipline there.
As we think about a scenario where, say, in 12 months, if some of those organic fee green shoots that were cited,
if we're still running at flattish fee income, just want to get a sense as to how you're thinking philosophically about
how you want to manage the expense base. And if we're not seeing that pickup in organic fee growth, how your
philosophy around that might evolve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. I'll make a couple of comments. When you look at that fee growth, it's also absorbing, and we pointed to,
$150 million fee waivers per quarter. So that's an enormous number. So underneath that, there has to be some
growth in order to sustain where we are. And we think we're going to be able to continue that. Obviously, based
on conditions and what actually happens to revenues, we'll take a harder and harder look at expenses. We've
been able to make the investments in technology, resiliency, automation, cyber, everything that we've done to
make ourselves a stronger company.
I got to admit it, it actually is more and more important, having gone through this last crisis, as clients see the
benefit of resiliency of a global operating model that was able to meet huge increases in volumes. And so if
anything, I think we'll probably see more as a result of that. So we've been able to do all of that and manage the
expenses and we'll drop more to the bottom line based on what happens to the revenue picture.

Operator: We will take our next question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great, thanks. Good morning. Just quick question on the asset management business. I know there was a
restructuring there in the past and combining some of the boutiques that you had standalone. But now what we've
seen across the asset management space is certainly more interest in consolidation. So I guess can you maybe
address that from both sides of it, like what's the opportunity to, one, do acquisitions and what's the appetite as
well to maybe get rid of potentially divest some of these businesses within asset management?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure, Brian. It's been kind of interesting as you start to see a little more action. I think as you think about that
business, there are kind of really three drivers of success, and that's probably what – now. And that's probably
what's moving some of the action. I think it comes down to scale, integrated distribution, if you have it and
obviously, performance.
And so if you look at – we are a $2 trillion of AUM. So we have meaningful scale. Our performance has actually
been pretty darn good. One of the things I cited in my opening remarks is that our 30 largest funds where there
are indices for them to follow and they make up about 60% of our revenues are performing in the top one – or first
or second quartile. And they've been there over the last three years. So I think we're well positioned and it's
reflective.
We've got some pretty interesting assets underneath there. The liability-driven investment, it's been growing. And
it's a business that we think we can – it's primarily in the UK and Europe, it's something I think we can import into
the US. We've got one of the world's largest credit managers. We just put a new CEO in place there. This is
primarily a European credit manager, and I think there's significant opportunity for it to grow. Probably
underperformed in the past couple of years, it's done fine, but I think it missed opportunities to grow faster.
And if you think about our distribution, we're pretty interesting, too, because we have a wealth manager, it's open
architected but it delivers some of our manufacturing capabilities. And Pershing is also a very powerful platform,
again, open architected, but it's a platform where there's real estate for some of our product and probably more
potential there.
So we've got a number of the components. So we're watching very carefully what's going on in the industry. And if
something made sense on our platform, then we have to give it hard consideration.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then just a second question. I mean last earnings call, you talked about the potential cost saves
opportunity from how you rethink workforce or workplace. In the future, [indiscernible] (01:17:04) work-from-home
in the pandemic, how far along are you rethinking the workforce or workplace of the future and when you could
actually see some cost saves come through from that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. So, as we think about it, it's going to impact real estate. It's going to impact things like disaster recovery
sites, because we've created a new amazing disaster recovery capability here. It will certainly impact, longer term,
what we think, business development, travel, entertainment, those type of costs. So there's a number of areas
throughout the organization.
We've done – we're starting to do a pretty deep analysis on who needs to be in the office all the time, who doesn't
need to be in the office any of the time and who should be in the office some of the time. And my view is there
continues to be a compelling argument for aggregating at least innovation, it leads to building really the
performance culture that you want to inculcate into the company, difficult not to do it without some [ph] in present
(01:18:17) meetings, I do think travel and seeing clients is still critical. I think it will change a little bit. And the use
of some of the technology now will be much more frequent. We've all gotten pretty astute at it as well, even me.
And so I think that will all change.
So we're kind of laying out where we could go and what the implication to our real estate is. But that's going to
[ph] – but for that to (01:18:42) factor into the P&L will take some time. And ultimately, as much as we might think
it should go one way or the other, the market's also going to dictate a bit, too, because the – we have a lot of
technologists and if the market starts to lean to more work from home, we'll adjust to that.

what would we need to see in the macro environment for you guys to actually reach a more normalized size of the
balance sheet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I think the balance sheet probably will grow traditionally with the growth in the underlying businesses, which
if you think about the AUC and there's a relationship to that, if you think about what's going on with Pershing
payables, there's a relationship to that. The treasury services business, for example, Gerard, we took a – we went
on a campaign. We said we probably we're too shy in taking on deposits, and there was an opportunity. We're a
great counterparty and our clients wanted us to grow our deposits there. So I feel some of that was core growth
underneath it.
It's hard for me to really estimate exactly what is excess versus what would have been the traditional growth over
that period and what would have grown based on our own internal efforts. But I would expect – there certainly is
some excess in it. And I would expect, if there is a change in interest rates, and we don't see that in the near term,
that would contract a bit, obviously, [ph] make it a (01:20:57) lot more profitable, but contracted a bit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then coming back to something you said earlier in the call about organic growth. If you look – if
you turn back the clock and look at your organic growth over the last three and maybe five years, how are you
framing out between existing customers giving you more business versus new customers owning new business
that drives that organic growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. So if we – first of all, existing customers are great customers, because they don't have – the
implementation costs and everything else about it is less. So if a new fund – if a client opens up a new fund and
they've got multiple custodians, and we're the ones winning the new funds.
That's organic growth and it's very important to our organic growth and it demonstrates the quality of our services
and the capabilities that we've got. And that's where we're seeing meaningful improvement. So we would include
that as well as new-new customers. They're only – in the asset management space, there are only so many new-
new customers to be had.

James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Maybe just a big picture question on expenses, Todd, it seems like the biggest challenge and
opportunity both is just sort of standardizing and automating the client interface. Just how do you think about that
opportunity set? Where are you? And can that be sort of a longer-term tailwind that's material for expenses?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Emily, do you want to take it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. Ultimately, we – many of our investments are all about improving the customer experience and making it
much more seamless. That's part and parcel of the open architecture that we've been talking about, and it's all
about data integration. And that's going to take a while, that's in journey. But – and every client looks and feels
slightly different. So we're kind of solving for many different outcomes. But ultimately, that's part of the open
architecture strategy in that we want to offer best-in-breed and as much flexibility and optionality to our clients as
we can.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
And the other thing that I would add is that, when we look at our technology, there's still a lot of legacy technology
debt. And one of the commitments and so the – when you look at where we're actually being forced to invest, it's
in a lot of older systems. And we could run those systems much more efficiently.
Of course, they're effective. They run, they're industrial, like a lot of banks and just about all banks have the same
issues. As we cloud-enable and make our underlying applications more and more efficient, there will be
opportunity. There will be long-term opportunity to get rid of a lot of that legacy technology debt. So, this is – so
we don't see this as a one or two-year effort. I think it is just – it's just making the commitment to constantly
reinvest to actually get it done because it does take investment to make that transition. And so, we're trying to
incorporate that into our investment activities so that we get to renew that stack. So, it's a combination of both
what's going on in the operations, how efficiently we can be operating our corporate functions as well as how
efficiently we can operate our technology.
