Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
John P. Barnes
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the full-
year overview on slide 2. We are very pleased with the company's financial and operating performance in 2019. It
was another noteworthy year for People's United as we acquired two banks and a specialty finance company,
enhanced our suite of banking technology, and strengthened core capabilities. As a result, we continue to build
the earnings power of the company, while further solidifying its foundation to generate consistent and sustainable
growth in the years ahead.
Commitment to our strategy of balancing organic growth and thoughtful M&A was evident during 2019. We began
the year by acquiring VAR Technology, an innovative specialty finance company with an exclusive focus on the
technology sector. VAR has been successful integrated into LEAF Capital and transitioned from an origination-for-
sale model to an origination-to-hold model.
In April, we closed the acquisition of BSB Bancorp, the holding company for Belmont Bank, and completed the
core conversion in July. Belmont has added to the momentum our franchise is generating in the Greater Boston
area. We are particularly pleased with the synergies provided by Belmont's commercial real estate team, which
continues to generate strong production. In November, we also closed the acquisition of United Financial
Bancorp, the holding company for United Bank. The addition of United bolsters our already significant share of
retail households and commercial clients across Central Connecticut and Western Massachusetts.
The integration is progressing well. The core systems conversion will take place early in the second quarter and
we are on track to realize projected cost saves. Our strong results this year are a testament to the efforts of our
employees who successfully integrated, VAR, completed the core system conversion for Belmont and advanced
the integration of United, while continuing to deliver organic growth and enhanced profitability. This performance
is further evidence that the integration of acquisitions is a significant core competency of People's United.
Throughout 2019, we made further investments in technology platforms as consumers continued to shift to digital
channels. We launched several mobile device and online-driven offerings this year, including our most recent
offering of a digital small business solution for loans $250,000 or less.
Looking ahead, we remain committed to providing enhanced digital access as we aim to deliver an integrated
service model that blends the best in customer service with digital solutions. As such, we will continue to partner
with fintech companies to bring greater efficiency, ease of use and scale to meet the evolving needs of our
customers.
Looking at the full-year financial performance, operating earnings increased 20% from a year ago to $552 million,
the highest in company's history. In addition, operating earnings of $1.39 per common share grew for the 10th
consecutive year. These strong results generated an operating return on average tangible common equity of
14.7%, an increase of 10 basis points compared to the prior year.
Total revenues of $1.8 billion increased 15% year-over-year, driven by both organic growth and recent
acquisitions. This increase reflects improvement in both net interest income and net non-interest income. Net
interest income of $1.4 billion was up 14% from 2018 or 11% excluding United, within our full year growth goal
range of 11% to 13%. As you will recall, we updated our full year goals earlier this year to include Belmont, but did
not incorporate United as the acquisitions had yet to close.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
Despite the interest rate environment during the year and the easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve,
our full year net interest margin expanded 2 basis points to 3.14%. Excluding United, the margin was 3.13%,
which is within our 3.05% to 3.15% goal range.
Non-interest income had a terrific year with – and especially strong fourth quarter. Full year results of $431 million
increased 18% or 13% on an operating basis, which far exceeded our 2% to 4% growth expectation. This
increase was driven by a variety of lines including a particularly high level of customer swap income. Operating
non-interest income excluding United increased 11%.
From an operating perspective, total expenses of $1.097 billion were up $112 million from a year ago. We are
pleased with these results given the inclusion of United, Belmont and VAR into the franchise during the year and
having Farmington on the books for a full 12 months. Excluding United, operating expenses were $1.074 billion,
well within our full-year goal range of $1.06 billion to $1.08 billion.
As a result of our revenue growth and the ability to control costs, while still making improvements and investments
in the franchise, we continue to enhance operating leverage as demonstrated by a 160 basis point improvement
from the prior year in the efficiency ratio to 55.8%. Period-end loans and deposits increased 24% and 21%,
respectively, from a year ago, driven both by recent acquisitions and organic growth.
Excluding United and the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio, period-end loan balances
were $38 billion, up 11% from year-end 2018, right in the middle of our 10% to 12% growth expectations for the
year.
In addition to the inclusion of Belmont, these results were driven by strong results in mortgage warehouse
lending, equipment finance and our specialized industry verticals within C&I, particularly – partially offset by
continued headwinds within commercial real estate and home equity.
Period-end deposit balances, excluding United, were $38.3 billion, an increase of 6%, which was below our full-
year goal of 10% to 12% growth. While we achieve meaningful growth in commercial deposits, retail balances
declined modestly from 2018 due to some managed runoff of higher cost deposits from Belmont and standalone
People's United. Furthermore, a managed decline in broker deposits also impacted the balances at year-end.
Before looking ahead, it is important to briefly reflect on the significant progress of our franchise. Over the last 10
years, we have almost tripled total assets to nearly $60 billion, increased full year operating earnings per share at
an average annual rate of 16%, strengthened our presence in metro New York and Greater Boston, deepened
already strong positions within our heritage markets and expanded our national businesses. At the same time, we
have remained true to our roots of delivering superior service at a local level, maintaining exceptional asset
quality and supporting our communities.
As we start a new decade, already filled with economic and competitive uncertainties, we are confident our long-
term approach to managing the business will enable us to generate value for customers and shareholders
regardless of the operating environment.
With that background in mind, let me outline our goals for the full-year 2020 as listed on slide 3. It is important to
note the following goals incorporate a full year of Belmont and United. The first goal is to grow our core loan
portfolio in the range of 2% to 4% on a period-end basis. The core loan portfolio excludes the runoff of select
United loan portfolios which ended 2019 with an aggregate balance of $1.346 billion. This balance is less than the
approximately $1.8 billion in runoff we referenced at the acquisitions announcement due to a subsequent decision
4


People’s United Financial, Inc.
(PBCT) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
to sell $492 million of these loans. As such, these balances are included the loans held for sale lines on the
balance sheet. We expect the runoff of the select United portfolios to be in the range of $300 million to $400
million for the full year.
Core loans also excludes the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio which is in runoff mode.
Period end balances for this portfolio finished 2019 at $737 million. We expect the runoff in the transactional New
York multifamily portfolio to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million for the full year.
After excluding these portfolios, the balance at year-end 2019 for core loans was $41.513 billion. Included in the
2% to 4% core loan growth is an assumption that residential mortgage balances will be unchanged from year-end
2019 as we continue to remix the balance sheet to focus on higher yielding portfolios. Secondly, period-end
deposit growth is anticipated to be in a range of 2% to 4% as we continue to focus on gathering core customer
deposits while managing down higher cost portfolios.
The next goal is for net interest income to increase in the range of 9% to 11%. Embedded in this goal is the
expectation for the net interest margin to be in the range of 3% to 3.1%. This net interest margin range is derived
from many different factors, one of which is an assumption of no change in the fed funds rate during the year.
Moving on to non-interest income. As I mentioned earlier, total non-interest income had – we had a terrific year in
2019, including a very strong fourth quarter. The results were driven by a variety of lines, including some that
have inherently lumpy results period to period. Our assumption is for a level of normalization to occur in 2020. As
such, we expect non-interest income on an operating basis to grow in the range of 2% to 4% from $424 million in
2019.
Operating non-interest expenses, which exclude merger-related costs, are anticipated to be in the range of $1.19
billion to $1.22 billion, as compared to the $1.097 billion in 2019. As a reminder, this range includes a full year of
results from Belmont and United. It is also important to note the core system conversion for United is not expected
until early in the second quarter.
We also expect to maintain excellent credit quality with a provision in the range of $40 million to $50 million. The
higher provision level reflects expected loan growth and the impact of CECL. In addition, we anticipate our
effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 20% to 22%.
Finally, we plan to maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that at year-end holding company common
equity Tier 1 capital ratio will be in the range of 10% to 10.5%. This goal does not contemplate any share
repurchases during the year. As you will recall, we positioned the buyback program announced in July as an
opportunistic capital management tool. As such, any decision to repurchase shares will be subject to market
conditions.
With that, I will pass it to David to discuss the fourth quarter results.

R. David Rosato
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Jack. We concluded 2019 with strong financial performance as demonstrated by another quarter of
record earnings. Operating earnings of $158.8 million increased 17% linked-quarter and reflected the acquisition
of United, improved net interest margin and positive operating leverage. It is important to note the fourth quarter
included the following items which were deemed non-operating. Merger-related costs of $22.6 million pre-tax or
$17.8 million after tax; an intangible asset write-off of $16.5 million pre-tax or $13 million after tax related to the

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
liquidation of our public mutual funds; a gain net of expenses of $7.6 million pre-tax or $6 million after tax related
to the sale of eight branches in Central Maine. The transaction closed in October and included approximately
$104 million in loans, $262 million in deposits and $240 million of assets under management.
Turning to slide 5, net interest income of $382.7 million increased $34 million or 10% from the third quarter. The
loan portfolio contributed $23.2 million to the increase due to higher balances. Lower deposit and borrowing costs
benefited net interest income by $5.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively. In addition, higher balances in the
securities portfolio added $2.8 million. Overall, the inclusion of United added approximately $35 million to net
interest income for the quarter.
As displayed on slide 6, net interest margin of 3.14% expanded 2 basis points linked-quarter. The margin
benefited from continued disciplined management of deposit costs, remixing of the loan portfolio and the net
effect of purchase accounting adjustments related to the United transaction. Excluding these purchase accounting
adjustments, the margin was 3.09% or 3 basis points less than the third quarter. Lower borrowing costs favorably
impacted net interest margin by 2 basis points, while lower loan yields reduced the margin by 5 basis points.
Turning to loans on slide 7, average balances of $42 billion increased by $3.7 billion or 10% from the third
quarter, driven primarily by the addition of United. On an organic basis, average balances increased $40 million or
less than 1%. Period-end balances of $43.6 billion increased $4.8 billion linked-quarter but were essentially flat
excluding United. Organic commercial loan growth of $314 million was driven by solid results in commercial real
estate, equipment finance and C&I, partially offset by seasonally lower mortgage warehouse lending balances.
The increase in commercial loans was offset by a $343 million decline in retail loans mostly due to our planned
reduction of residential mortgages as we continue to remix the balance sheet with a focus on higher yielding
portfolios.
Commercial real estate organic growth was driven primarily by strong performance in northern New England,
particularly in Massachusetts. All three of our equipment finance businesses grew balances during the quarter,
with LEAF once again generating excellent production. C&I continues to benefit from our specialized industry
verticals with especially good results in fund banking, healthcare and franchise lending during the quarter.
Moving on to deposits on slide 8. Average balances of $42.2 billion increased $3.5 billion or 9% from the third
quarter, while period-end balances of $43.6 billion were up $5 billion or 13%. The higher balances were driven by
the inclusion of United. Excluding the acquisition, average and period-end balances decreased $97 million and
$287 million, respectively, or less than 1% on each basis. While we achieved solid growth in commercial deposits,
retail balances declined modestly due to some managed write-off of higher cost deposits. In addition, a managed
reduction in brokered deposits also impacted balances.
We remained focused on controlling pricing as evidenced by a 13-basis point reduction in deposit cost during the
quarter. Similar to the third quarter, we remain disciplined in managing costs across the franchise.
Looking to slide 9, we've continued to achieve strong non-interest income with $124.2 million in the fourth quarter.
This result marks an increase of $18.2 million or 17% on a linked-quarter basis. Operating non-interest income
which excludes the $7.6 million gain, net of expenses, from the sale of eight central main branches was $116.6
million, up $10.6 million or 10% from the third quarter. The inclusion of United added approximately $5 million to
non-interest income in the quarter.
By non-interest income category, the $10.6 million linked-quarter increase was primarily driven by $3.3 million and
higher customer interest rate swap income, a $1.9 million increase in bank service charges primarily attributable

to the addition of United, $1.1 million in higher commercial banking fees, and a $7.7 million increase in other non-
interest income. This increase was driven by several items including a $3.3 million gain on the sale leaseback of
our office building in Burlington, Vermont, and a $1.6 million benefit to non-interest income from the mark-to-
market of one equity security position. These increases were partially offset by a $2.8 million decrease in
insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, and a $600,000 decline in
investment management fees which was partially related to the $240 million of asset under management sold as
part of the Central Maine branch sale.
On slide 10, non-interest expense of $325.7 million increased $44.3 million linked-quarter. Included in the fourth
quarter were $39.1 million of non-operating costs in the following categories: $25.5 million in other expenses, $7.5
million in compensation and benefits, $5.6 million in professional and outside services, and the remaining
$500,000 in occupancy and equipment. In comparison, the third quarter incurred $5 million of non-operating
costs.
Excluding non-operating costs, non-interest expense of $286.6 million was up $10.2 million or 4% linked-quarter.
This increase was driven by the inclusion of United which added approximately $24 million to operating non-
interest expense in the quarter. By expense category, the $10.2 million linked-quarter increase was mostly due to
$7 million in higher occupancy and equipment expenses, a $6.6 million increase in compensation and benefits, an
additional $4 million in professional and outside service costs, and a $2 million increase in regulatory
assessments. This variance was due to a lower third quarter assessment resulting from an FDIC credit. The
largest driver offsetting these increases was $10.9 million in lower other expenses. As a reminder, third quarter
other expenses were unfavorably impacted by certain legal and other one-time operational costs.
Turning to slide 11, the efficiency ratio of 53.7% improved 310 basis points from the third quarter and 140 basis
points year-over-year reflecting well controlled expenses and higher revenues.
Asset quality was once again exceptional across each of our portfolios as demonstrated on slide 12. Originated
non-performing assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 55 basis points is a 1-basis point
improvement from the third quarter and below our peer group and top 50 banks. Net charge-offs of 6 basis points
were unchanged from Q3 and continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our non-performing assets.
Briefly, on slides 13 and 14, return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity declined 7
basis points and 120 basis points respectively from the third quarter. On an operating basis, both metrics
improved. Operating return on average assets was up 8 basis points to 113 basis points while operating return on
average tangible common equity increased 80 basis points to 15.2%. Finally, capital ratios remain strong given
our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management.
This concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're
ready for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to open the lines up for your questions. [Operator
Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon with Piper Sandler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Thomas Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Hey, guys. Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Hi, Mark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Hey, Mark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Thomas Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
First question I had is just to clarify a comment Jack you made about the loan balances. So, if we take the year-
end loan balances of call it $43.6 billion and that grows sort of 2% to 4%, and did I hear correctly that you're going
to see runoff of $300 million to $400 million on the United portfolio this year and another $300 million to $400
million from New York multifamily runoff?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yes, that's correct, Mark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Thomas Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
So, if loans – you split the difference on the growth 2% to 4%, say it's a $1.3 billion less, somewhere between
$600 million and $800 million of loan growth or runoff, I should say. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
The loan growth excludes the runoff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Correct. So if you take the ending total loans of $43.6 million, reduce the $1.346 billion of United and the
multifamily book of $737 million, brings you down to $41.5 million. So that's the base that the loan growth is off of.
Then additionally, we expect those two portfolios to runoff between $300 million and $400 million each during the
year.

Mark Thomas Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Got you. Okay. And then secondly, can you help us think about the purchase accounting impact on the margin
over the next maybe quarter or two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So we called out, Mark, the 5 basis points in Q4, that is a good number. The way I think about kind of two
components obviously; the loan side and the deposit side. The loan purchase accounting will be with us for about
four years. On the deposit side most of that, Mark, is around the CD portfolio which is about a year. So you're
going to see a first half benefit larger than the second half, but the second half will be a run rate for a couple of
years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Thomas Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay. And then the $16.5 million write-off for intangible asset, what is the asset that the write-off is on? I didn't
see it in the release anywhere.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
So that was the value that we attributed to the mutual fund business at acquisition of Gerstein Fisher.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Thomas Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay. And then lastly, Jack, I wondered if you could comment on your outlook for M&A in the Northeast. And has
your view on bigger deals changed in light of how the market has received so well some of these larger
transactions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
So, I really don't see the pace of M&A generally changing dramatically one way or the other in the Northeast, I
would say, at this point. And in terms of appetite for larger deals, I mean, we've been willing to consider larger
deals, if appropriate, the right fix, et cetera. So, again, I don't think our view has changed. There's not many larger
deals across our footprint. I will say that, if you look at our footprint and what's out there.

John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Hi, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Actually, I had a similar question line of thought here. Can you just give us the base that you're using for both the
NII and the fees that you're growing off of? I just want to make sure we're on the same page.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Well, starting with fees, the basis – the $424 million that we referenced, the base for the NII is just what is in the
press release which is $1.412 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got you. Okay, perfect. That's helpful. And then obviously your CET1 target, the 10% to 10.5% of not including
buybacks, can you just talk about how aggressive you might potentially be with buybacks. I mean, could you get
down to 9%, 9.5%? I'm trying to think of how to think about layering in buybacks on top of that base number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
So Ken, what I would say is when we announced the buyback and then in the call on the third quarter and today,
for the third time, we've used the term opportunistic. The 10% to 10.5% is the consistent capital level that we put
out as a goal for last year as well. We manage within that last year and our intention would be to manage within
this year as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So I guess, given zero buybacks this whole year, then when you say opportunistic, it would not be a crazy
assumption to assume zero buybacks next year as well. That's one possibility. Is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Well, there is a full range of possibilities from no buybacks to the full completion of the 5% based on our views of
the equity markets, and obviously our stock in particular.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Understood. Thank you very much.

Okay.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Wanted to touch on the on the loan growth so that the 2% to 4%, which buckets are going to be driving that? And
it sounds like you guys are still happy to run down resi mortgage like what sort of headwind should we expect
from resi mortgage in 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
So this is Jack, Casey. As we said in the script, we're expecting resi to basically stay flat yearend-to-yearend.
There's actually a lot of activity in there as you can imagine given amortization and payoffs. So one of the things
that I guess I hope is clear to everybody. We're very committed to resi mortgage in terms of delivering the
products to our customer base. It's important part of the retail part of our bank. So there are some wholesale
channels where we can do less. And as we've been saying, our focus is trying to remix gradually so that we're
booking more higher yield portfolios and a softening, if you will, the percentage of – reducing the percentage of
residential mortgages overall on the balance sheet. So that's where the resi is.
I'll ask Jeff Tengel to talk about the loan growth and the other business lines.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey J. Tengel A
President, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. In the commercial business, we think it's going to be very similar to what we experienced this year. We're
not expecting a lot of growth, if any, in our commercial real estate portfolio for all of the reasons we've talked
about in the past. And so, across the rest of our franchise, our core middle market business particularly in our
larger markets like Connecticut and Massachusetts have had growth in 2019 and we think that will continue in
2020.
We've seen a lot of good growth across the number of the industry specialization businesses that David
referenced. We think that momentum will continue into 2019. And our equipment finance businesses also had

good growth in 2019 and we expect that to continue in 2020. So we feel really good about all of those commercial
businesses and think that the pipelines are in pretty good shape and feel pretty confident going into the year.

R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Hey, Casey, just to put a number around our thinking about resi mortgages, if you go back to like June of 2017, so
before the last three acquisitions, we had about 21% of the loan book in resi mortgages. At June of 2019, it was
up to almost 25%. And so, we're just trying to bring that number down a few percentage points without selling
anything out of it, to do it on a natural basis, and that'll obviously bring up the commercial side which yields more.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Understood. Got it. Okay. And then just switching to the reserve side of things with a lot of moving parts here, but
just given all the ups and downs within the loan portfolio; but as we think about CECL and your adoption of it,
what do you see the go forward provision rate, the loan loss reserve ratio settling out as you adopt CECL?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Well, so we gave a provision guidance of $40 million to $50 million, said that was inclusive of United. So that's
$10 million to$12.5 million a quarter is the way we're thinking about it and you should as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
Hey, just a couple questions, I guess, on the margin. So I hear you with the lower accretion as we go into the
second half of the year, but are you – with the focus on the higher yielding loans as the area of growth, I guess,
where are you seeing more of that incremental pressure on the margin? Is it re-pricing of the loan portfolio or is
there really just not much more room to move on the deposit side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
I would say it's a little bit of both. So we had three quick Fed moves in kind of a compressed period of time in the
third and fourth quarter. I would say, by the time the quarter was over, the loan portfolio had kind of re-priced, any
lags in there had kind of come down. Remember, about 44% at this point of our loan portfolio is really one month
LIBOR driven and one month LIBOR and down 34 basis points, I think it was, in Q4.
We telegraphed our guidance around steady interest rates, steady Fed funds rate. So, I think as the fixed piece of
the portfolio grows, you'll see some downward pressure there. I think if the Fed does not do anything all year, it
will be harder to bring down deposit pricings. There'll be some positive role in our CD books. And the other piece
of that is we're seeing good restrain across the industry on deposit pricing. So, I just think, in a steadier
environment, the ability to make moves will be a little bit muted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then on the securities portfolio, I know United had some CLOs. Were those completely gone
by the end of the year? And as a secondary part of that, what I guess drove that 5-basis-point growth in the
securities portfolio? Is that a purchase effort on your part or is that more just some mark-to-market on the portfolio
that was acquired?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
No. So, they did have a CLO portfolio. That portfolio never hit our books, meaning it was gone before we acquired
them. We did exactly like we said we would when we announced the deal. All those securities were liquidated. All
that came over from their portfolio was a little over $300 million of securities that, we would say, are very much
like the stuff that we own.
Within the quarter, you saw I believe a 5-basis-point improvement in the yield on the securities portfolio driven by
the addition of some municipal bonds which – in that portfolio as well as really good low levels of prepayment
activity across the mortgage-backed. So, the amount of amortization that went through the portfolio was really
well controlled in the fourth quarter resulting in a higher yield.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. Just finally for me, with the branches that were sold up in Maine, in a more compact branch
footprint now I guess in Southern New England. Are there areas where you could actually see or we could see the
bank do some de novo expansion whether its South Shore mass or more infill in the Boston area or would any
future footprint expansion really be driven by M&A?

Hey, Jack.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
...say we just opened de novo branch in the Seaport area in Boston and we certainly would consider looking at
other opportunities there. That branch by the way is really off to a great start. And we also did Penn Station in
New York, and again, we're encouraged by that. It's off to a great start. There's a lot of activity there. So we
definitely are open to de novo. Love to build out the south shore Boston and kind of considering and looking at our
options there, and so we're open to it. We actually are also closing – continue to close branches, so kind of
working to optimize the branch footprint all the time.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Well, it really is off – it's that growth off that base that we gave, that 43.5% base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
So that's 2% to 4% loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
But we've excluded some runoffs in that [indiscernible] (00:45:38)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I'm sorry I gave the wrong number. Off the base of 41.5%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Right. I guess I'm trying to figure out when the company's position does start showing total loan growth, that's
more material ex of these runoff items, doesn't sound like it's 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
I mean, I think one thing, it's when the commercial real estate market – however you want to describe it, it's
clearly frothy and it hits us in many different ways, it's our largest portfolio. So we did, what was it, Jeff, a little over
$2 billion in originations in 2019. And we're basically flat. So we're active in the business, we're taking care of our
customers but we're getting payoffs from shadow banking companies. We're getting sale of properties. So it's
hard to predict, Steve, when that changes other than some kind of a change in my mind and change in the, like a
cycle change for us or so, maybe a change in rate environments where that changes the dynamics. And that's
why I think when Jeff kind of referred to whether it's middle market business banking, the leasing companies, the
verticals; we're actually doing quite well in a lot of our businesses and moving ourselves forward, but that's
challenge.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then thanks. And then finally on expenses. For the guidance, you guys still assuming 75% phase-in of
UBNK cost saves in 2020? Is that still the assumption?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah, yeah. No change.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.

Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
$1.4 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And is your expectation for that in – I mean for balances to drop as you're kind of thinking about the book in
total, the total loan book that you could see balances drop in 2020 for that line?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yes, a small amount. I mean, they came off a little bit in Q4, about $180 million or so. We expect a little bit of
decline next year. Subject once again, I mean, the mortgage book was completely different than we thought at the
beginning of the year, subject to level of interest rates and refi activity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, okay. And then, on the loans that you have in the held-for-sale, the resi mortgages that you guys are
selling, what's the blended yield on those?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Well, so just to be clear, the $0.5 billion that you see that showed up on the loans held for sale are United Bank
portfolios that subsequent to the deal we decided to sell and that work is in process.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So, does that mean you can't offer what the yield was on those loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah, we'd rather not.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, okay. Okay. And then, just going back to the dynamics of the NIM, so David, you know, I understand you're
saying that if we're in a steady rate environment, there's probably less movement to see here. But can you just
talk a little bit about what you're doing with your deposit offering rates right now? And then, is there – would there
be a catalyst that putting rate aside that would cause you to kind of drop your deposit rates again? Just trying to
think about the flow-through of potentially lower funding going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure. The – so I would say number one, I would stress that in the – since the Fed started moving down since the
end of July, we've been very disciplined around deposit pricing across all of our businesses, but we've also would
17


People’s United Financial, Inc.
(PBCT) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
say that the industry has been well disciplined as well which is important, because when you have one or two
players who aren't, it's difficult. So, for example, today, our best CD offer out there is a six-month CD at 1.70
times, right? So, slightly below the top end of the Fed's target range.
The other thing that we did on the retail side is become less aggressive on money market promotions. So, those
offer rates are lower relative to where Fed funds target is, and that's been another dynamic in the last six months.
I don't see those type of – that type of behavior changing in 2020, at least in the near term. So, I just – I think if
that's day to day, our frontline folks being in front of customers trying to generate growth in new accounts and
serving our customers. But we're able to do it in a slightly less promo environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
The other thing I would add, Collyn, is that we're really pleased with the work that our relationship managers have
done going out proactively and having the conversation with customers about the Fed raise rates and we raised
deposit pricing. Now, the Fed has lowered rates and we need to lower pricing. And because of relationships and
good communication, we feel really good that we've had nice success.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And I guess along those lines, if we think about – recognizing obviously the
incremental growth in the portfolio is going to be fairly low. But just the margin on the new business that's coming
on in the wake of, well, yes, we saw the curve steepen it, so obviously very narrow, but are you kind of structurally
seeing kind of a NIM benefit longer term that the incremental spread that you're putting on your balance sheet is
more than that 3% or is it less?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
What I would say actually Collyn a little bit the other way. So, last quarter, we referenced that that differential
came down from about 50 basis points in the second quarter to about 30 basis points in the third. That has moved
down a bit in the fourth quarter. Subject to mix and shape of the yield curve, I think that's going – that dynamic will
slowly come in, not expand.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, okay. And then – okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:54:16) Collyn, just to finish that thought. So, there's two components to that, right? There's
interest rate, benchmark interest rates and credit spreads. And what I would say is the driver is benchmark
interest rates. Our credit spreads have been pretty steady in the back half of last year. And we don't expect that to
change.

Okay. Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then, the decision around selling the mutual fund, some of the mutual
funds, can you just walk through that or is that like specifically tied to the bridges, or – just trying to understand
what you guys were doing there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Well, we did not sell the mutual funds. So, we – they were public mutual funds. It's a little over $550 million. We –
that were in Gerstein Fisher. We just stopped using public mutual funds as the vehicle for those customers to
invest. We're still managing that money. We just are doing it back in what we call our managed account group.
So, same customers, same investment strategies, just not in a public mutual fund format where we have higher
costs to serve those customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Okay. And then, just as we think about the initial accretion targets for UBNK, I think it
was like $0.07 a share that you guys are looking for, for EPS accretion. How do you sort of see that folding in?
Because I think, if we align what some of the targets are – well, let me just ask that question. How do you see that
$0.07 folding in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
So that $0.07 which was on a fully phased-in cost basis, right. So, and as Jack referenced, the conversion will be
done in early in the second quarter. And then, there's a little bit of time before we get everything out, all the cost
out and get to the permanent, if you will, run rate.
So, everything around that transaction from purchase accounting, accretion is all on target, so no change in our
expectations. The only change really is the – rather than running off $1.8 billion of loans, we decided to take that
$0.5 billion and sell them. So, that means that $0.5 billion of assets will be gone sooner than we originally thought,
but it's actually not going to be material to the financial projections that we gave.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So that doesn't change that? Okay. Okay. That's helpful. All right. I will leave it there. Thanks, guys.

Hi, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew M. Breese Q
Analyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.
Hey, just wanted to confront quick on CECL, the initial reserve guidance increase, $40 million to $60 million, does
that still hold? And is that – should we expect a similar impact to capital?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
So, that's – just for everyone's benefit, that's what we referenced on the third quarter call. As a reminder, that did
not include United Bank. Our work around CECL continues. We now think that we'll actually be just around the
lower end of that number when all is said and done, so plus or minus $40 million. And then, there will be some
additional to United, but that work is still in progress as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew M. Breese Q
Analyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.
Could you give us some sort of a range perhaps? Is it significantly less or more than the $40 million, just for
ballpark purposes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.

R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
I think it's about the same. The credit discipline of the company is unchanged. The changing nature or complexion
of the credit risk on the balance sheet is not significantly different from where we have been historically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew M. Breese Q
Analyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.
Okay. So, despite the mix shift, it will stay flat. Understood.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew M. Breese Q
Analyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.
Your securities portfolios, just going back to Jared's question, I just want to confirm, because prior commentary
was that you would sell roughly $550 million. Should we expect the $7.8 billion securities portfolio, should we
expect that to hold flat through 2020? Is that a good modeling estimate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. That's fine. As I said, everything we said we would sell out of United, we did. And actually, some of it was,
as I referenced on the CLOs, they actually did it prior to acquisition. And so, today, the securities portfolio is about
13% of total assets. We've been there for a while. That's less than some years. We are running 15%, but where
the level of interest rate is pretty modest, steepness of the yield curve, we're pretty much going to keep things
where they are as we see it today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew M. Breese Q
Analyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.
Understood. Okay. And then, my last one. Just concerning your actions on the branch network, your comments
on taking a look at the physical branch network, could you just remind us of the stop-and-shop supermarket
branches? How many are there? How are they performing? Are they performing up to expectations? If there's a
contract associated with them, when is that up for renewal? Just wanted to get a sense for – as you consider the
branch network, whether or not the supermarket branches are part of the long-term story?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure. I'll give you a couple of numbers and then if Jack wants to make any other comments. So, today or at year-
end, we had about – we have 450 branches across the franchise. The stop-and-shops across New York and
Connecticut are about 150 of the 450 branches. They are a critical part today and have been of our branch
network. They're a low-cost delivery source for us. And then the contract that we've talked about before is up in
about two years, we also own an option to extend that if we want.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
So, I would say, just to add that we're working with stop-and-shop to look to the future and kind of, if you will, the
model that we're using and we're having some very constructive conversations about that. So, we'll have to just
work our way through that period and determine where we go.

Matthew M. Breese Q
Analyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.
Understood. Okay. And then, just my last one, ticky-tacky, really. Just concerning loan yield quarter-over-quarter,
the equipment financing bucket only decreased 5 basis points. I was a little surprised by the movement there.
Could you just give us a reminder of the typical equipment finance loan structure, variable floating versus fixed,
and how much LEAF with the higher yielding component played into what was relatively a small move in that
bucket?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
So, I will interpret your question as you were pleasantly surprised by the performance. The LEAF is the highest
yielding portfolio of the three. So, everything across our three equipment platforms is fixed rate production, right,
unlike our mortgage warehouse or ABL, which is 100% one month LIBOR. These are our fixed rate cash flows for
a predominant amount of our fixed rate cash flows. And spreads and yield, spreads don't change that often and
they're not – the business especially in LEAF and PUEFC, the old, former Fin Fed, are – it's a rate-driven
business and they don't move that often. So, that's how that yield even in a down 75 basis point Fed funds
environment holds up.
The largest of our three platforms, PCLC, is lower yielding and more market sensitive, but that is the business that
we have held flat from an outstandings perspective for the last three years or so. And then, don't forget, this was
the year that at the beginning of the year we bought VAR Technologies and we brought them into the fold. And
they're really nice high yield originator as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew M. Breese Q
Analyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.
Understood. Could you give us an idea what the LEAF yield is? And that's my last question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure. So that yield – just on a coupon yield, ignoring a nice fee income, is yields from call it 7.25% to about 8%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew M. Breese Q
Analyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.
Great. That's all I had. Thank you.
