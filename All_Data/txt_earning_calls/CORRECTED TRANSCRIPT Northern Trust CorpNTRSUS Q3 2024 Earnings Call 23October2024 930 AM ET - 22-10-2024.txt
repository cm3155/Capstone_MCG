Michael G. O'Grady
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. As Jennifer mentioned,
Dave Fox became our CFO on October 1 when Jason became President of our Wealth Management business.
Jason will review our financial performance for the third quarter in a few minutes, and he and I will take your
questions. Dave will take Jason's place on our fourth quarter earnings call. And many of you will have the
opportunity to meet Dave in the coming weeks. We're grateful to Jason for his considerable contributions over the
past five years as CFO, including successfully managing our balance sheet through a number of challenging
events, including the COVID pandemic and the collapse of several financial institutions last year. I'm confident
that Jason has the right skills, understanding of the business, and vision to lead Wealth Management into its next
chapter of growth.
I also want to welcome Dave to the CFO chair. Dave has a long track record of success in leading businesses
and driving financial performance. Most recently, Dave ran our Global Family Office business. Under his tenure,
GFO trust fees grew at a compound annual rate of 10%. Dave also served as Head of Asset Servicing for the

Americas. Dave is a highly respected leader whose deep industry knowledge and strong financial acumen make
him the right choice to serve as Northern's next CFO.
Turning to our third quarter performance, our results benefited from strong market performance, but also reflect
continued positive momentum across our businesses. Relative to the prior year, trust fees were up 8%, net
interest income grew 21%, and excluding notables, earnings per share grew 36% (sic) [32%] (00:03:23).
Importantly, we generated positive trust fee and total operating leverage, while continuing to make significant
investments in our business and infrastructure. We also returned $453 million to shareholders.
Within Wealth Management, we generated strong year-over-year trust fee growth of 9% and reached record AUM
levels. Our new business momentum improved, reflecting the maturation of a number of initiatives started over
the past 12 to 18 months. Global Family Office performed particularly well, generating mid-single digit organic
growth both in the third quarter and year-to-date. International relationships, which have been an area of focus in
recent years, drove a healthy portion of this growth, including a marquee win sourced through collaboration with
Asset Servicing, demonstrating the power of our One Northern Trust strategy.
Asset Management generated positive liquidity flows for the seventh consecutive quarter and positive flows in tax
advantaged equity, active fixed income, and alternatives. This translated into healthy organic AUM growth,
despite continued pressure on index products. Continued strong investment performance is supporting our
organic growth, with active fixed income outperforming benchmarks over one-, three-, and five-year time frames.
NTAM's performance is also attributable to leveraging our One Northern Trust strategy to deliver clients the
solutions and capabilities of the entire firm. Year-to-date, NTAM has launched 13 new products, including the
treasury only money market fund that has generated nearly $2 billion inflows in less than six months, largely from
GFO clients.
Our Asset Servicing business performed well in the quarter. Transaction volumes were healthy. Capital markets
activities were up double-digits for the second quarter, and new business growth continues to be booked at
attractive margins. As we discussed, our goal is to generate new business that is scalable. We've shifted our
focus to opportunities that require lower levels of incremental costs and to cross-selling products and services to
existing clients.
As an example, this week we announced an expansion of our relationship with Artemis, a leading UK-based asset
manager with more than $33 billion in AUM, wherein all trading activities for Artemis's equity funds and all OTC
and exchange-traded derivatives will be outsourced to Northern. We will now support the complete life cycle of
these investments, from execution to custody, including fund administration, depositary, global custody, and
transfer agency services for its UK and Luxembourg-domiciled funds. While it will take time to realize the full
benefits of the pivot in our strategy, it should lead to more profitable growth as our business mix shifts.
During the third quarter, we proudly celebrated our company's 135th anniversary. The core principles of service,
expertise, and integrity upon which our company was founded still guide us today. As we look forward, we're
taking steps to strengthen the foundation, position the firm for higher underlying growth, and enhance our
operational efficiency, all while continuing to invest to meet the evolving needs of our clients and to create value
for all our stakeholders for years to come.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jason to review our financial performance for the quarter. Jason?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
Thank you, Mike. And let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. Let's
dive into the financial results for the quarter, starting on page 4. This morning, we reported third quarter net
income of $465 million, earnings per share of $2.22, and our return on average common equity was 15.4%. Our
reported results included a $68 million pre-tax gain on an equity investment and a $13 million escrow payment
associated with our existing Visa swap agreements. Together, these two notable items boosted other operating
income by $55 million pre-tax and $43 million after tax.
Trust, investment, and other servicing fees totaled $1.2 billion, a 3% sequential increase and an 8% increase
compared to last year. Net interest income on an FTE basis was a record $569 million, up 7% sequentially and up
21% from a year ago. Our assets under custody and administration were up 5% sequentially and 23% as
compared to the prior year. Our assets under management were up 6% sequentially and 22% year-over-year.
And, overall, our credit quality remains very strong. Excluding notable items in all periods, other non-interest
income was down 5% sequentially and down 3% over the prior year. Revenue was up 3% sequentially and up
10% on a year-over-year basis. Expenses were up slightly less than 1% sequentially and up 6% over the prior
year, and earnings per share grew 36% (sic) [32%] (00:08:38).
Turning to our Asset Servicing results on page 5, assets under custody and administration for Asset Servicing
clients were $16.3 trillion at quarter-end, reflecting a 23% year-over-year increase. Asset Servicing fees totaled
$667 million. Custody and fund administration fees were $453 million, up 6% year-over-year, reflecting the impact
from strong underlying equity markets and a weaker US dollar. Both comparisons were dampened by the client
exits we discussed last quarter, which are now fully reflected in our run rate. Assets under management for Asset
Servicing clients were $1.2 trillion, up 22% over the prior year. Investment management fees within Asset
Servicing were $153 million, up a strong 11% year-over-year due to favorable markets, and to a lesser extent,
new business activities.
Moving to our Wealth Management business on page 6, assets under management for our Wealth Management
clients were $444 billion at quarter-end, up 20% year-over-year. Trust, investment, and other servicing fees for
Wealth Management clients were $530 million, up 9% year-over-year, due primarily to strong equity markets.
Moving to page 7 and our balance sheet and net interest income trends. Our average earning assets were flat on
a linked-quarter basis, as a decrease in loans was offset by an increase in securities. Our average liquidity levels
remained strong, with highly liquid assets comprising 62% of our deposits and more than 50% of total earning
assets on average. The duration of our securities portfolio is 1.6 years and the total balance sheet duration
continues to be less than 1 year. Net interest income was $569 million and our net interest margin was 1.68%.
This strength was attributable to several factors. First, deposits came in modestly better than our expectations.
Average deposits were $113 billion, down less than 1% from second quarter levels, and non-interest-bearing
deposits remained stable at 15% of the mix. Second, deposit pricing improved. We had several large client
deposits with very thin spreads roll-off, and they were replaced by a similar level of more attractively priced
deposits. And as expected, we realized a very strong deposit beta on institutional accounts relative to the recent
rate cuts. And, third, given especially conducive market conditions, we saw higher-than-average quarterly
contributions from transactional and other items. In the aggregate, these items elevated third quarter NII by
approximately $10 million to $15 million.
Turning to page 8, as reported, non-interest expense was approximately $1.4 billion in the third quarter, down
11% sequentially and up 6% as compared to the prior year. Excluding notable items in both previous periods, as
listed on the slide, expenses in the third quarter were up approximately 1% sequentially and 6% year-over-year.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
Now, let's go back and review our core expenses from the quarter, which exclude all notable items.
Compensation expense was up 5% over the prior year, reflecting the impact of this year's base pay adjustments,
modest levels of hiring associated with our modernization initiative and underlying growth in the business, and
unfavorable currency movements. Compensation expense was flat sequentially. Outside services expense
increased 12% relative to the prior-year period, largely due to incremental modernization and resiliency spend. It
was also flat sequentially. Equipment and software expense increased 14% (sic) [16%] (00:12:51) year-over-year,
mostly related to higher depreciation and amortization expense. Sequentially, it was up 4% (sic) [3%] (00:12:59).
Excluding notables, we generated over 100 basis points of trust fee operating leverage, over 150 basis points of
overall operating leverage, and our expense-to-trust fee ratio improved by 200 basis points on a linked-quarter
basis. As we look out to the fourth quarter, we expect our total operating expenses to be up approximately 2%
relative to the third quarter.
Turning to page 9, our capital levels and regulatory ratios remained strong in the quarter. And we continue to
operate at levels well above our required regulatory minimum. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the
standardized approach remained flat at 12.6%, as capital accretion was offset by a slight increase in RWA levels.
Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.1%, up 10 basis points from the prior quarter. At quarter-end, our unrealized pre-
tax loss on available-for-sale securities was $603 million. We returned $453 million to common shareholders in
the quarter through cash dividends of $152 million and common stock repurchases of $301 million.
Now, before starting the Q&A portion of the call, on a personal note, I want to offer a quick thank you. It has been
a joy and an honor to serve as CFO for Northern for the last five years. It's been a pleasure to work with the
analyst community and the world-class investors we have as shareholders. I wish Dave Fox the very best as he
takes on the new role. I work closely with Dave since he joined Northern 12 years ago. He's a strategic, forward-
thinking executive, and he's going to play a critical role in driving impactful change within the company and
ensuring that it's positioned for long-term success.
And with that, please open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe
Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Leung Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Sharon actually filling in for Steven this morning. Jason, earlier this year, you had talked
about the asset sensitivity across the different categories on the balance sheet. So, cash, 100% sensitivity to
short rates; loans and securities, about a third floating. Can you give us a quick update on the floating rate mix,
just given that you've done a couple of securities repositioning actions since the last time you updated it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch. I just want to make sure I answer your question really precisely. Can you do it again a little
louder?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Leung Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah, sure. Sorry. So earlier this year, you had talked about the asset sensitivity across the different balance
sheet categories, cash, 100% sensitive to short rates and loans as well, and securities book about a third floating.
Just given some of the securities repositioning actions you've taken since that update, can you give us like a quick
mark-to-market on the floating rate mix?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, floating is about 50% at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Leung Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay, great. And then, as we look at our expense forecast beyond 2024, can you just frame how much of this
year's expense growth was inflated by investments in resiliency, when those investments should be completed,
and whether we should expect those investment dollars to fall to the bottom line or get redeployed elsewhere in
the franchise?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
And just to clarify, you're asking about the expense investments in modernization and resiliency and how that's
going to trend over time?

Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
So, yeah, so we do expect that that will continue for the next at least two, three quarters. But, at some point, likely
late next year, we'll start to see it decline. We don't have any plans to, dollar for dollar, thematically redeploy that
somewhere else. This is more of a distinct effort to try and address our desires to improve modernization and
some other technology and automation efforts in the business.

Hey, good morning.

Good morning, Ebrahim. How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good, and congrats, Jason and David, on your new roles. Just maybe following up on expense, and more broadly
going back to the leadership changes that were announced back in September, maybe, Mike, Jason, give us a
perspective of, I think, higher frustration from investors from time to time around just the focus on operational
efficiency kind of not translating into bottom line results.
Should we read into these changes, realignment, as something a little bit out of the ordinary in terms of what it
means for operational efficiency going forward? Would love any perspective there, and how we should think about
incremental expense spend? I heard what you responded, Jason. But I'm just wondering if all of this is baked into
the expense base as we come out of the fourth quarter, or will there be more additional expenses and
investments tied to resiliency? Thank you.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
Sure, Ebrahim. It's Mike. I'll start off. So, I would say, we believe in structure following strategy. And so, the
organizational changes that we announced in September reflect the strategy that we've put in place going back
over a year ago. And we've tried to keep very straightforward, which is focused on strengthening the foundation,
optimizing our growth, and driving productivity.
And we already mentioned the changes with Jason and Dave. But importantly, one of the other big changes was
creating the role of a COO, chief operating officer, which Pete Cherecwich will be the COO or is the COO of the
company. And with Pete's decades of experience in managing both complex client relationships, but also global
operations, he's really well positioned to drive operational excellence, resiliency, and also scalable growth. So, to
your point, we are very much trying to align the organization in such a way that we can get greater scale and
operating efficiencies and resiliency out of the company on that front.
Teresa Parker took over the role of President of Asset Servicing for Pete to work through that organizational
transition to ensure that we do it in a way that we continue to be client-focused and differentiate ourselves in that
way. And likewise, Steve Fradkin is Vice Chair and importantly is focused on the One Northern Trust strategy and
operationalizing all the things that we do on that front. So, feel very good about the organizational changes to help
us drive the strategy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess if I may follow up on just the NII question, Jason, for you. It was a positive surprise this quarter
when we look at that $569 million in NII this quarter. If we get some gradual rate cuts, given the positioning of the
balance sheet, if the deposit backdrop is stabilizing, should we expect NII continues to grow from the third quarter
levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, there's some good news in the NII results, for sure. And even though it looks like deposits were just flat,
underneath that, we had meaningful exits of some very thinly large deposits, and we knew that coming into – that
those were going to leave coming into the quarter, that's part of the reason we anticipated deposits being down.
But we were pleasantly surprised by the fact that in other areas of the organization that level of deposit was
replaced with much more attractively priced deposits. You add on to that we didn't see the typical seasonal
decline that we go through in August in particular. And so, it's not just the deposit levels holding in, but it's the
underlying nature of the deposits and where they are now is much better.
That said, if you look into the fourth quarter, we're anticipating rate cuts. And as much as we feel good about the
strength of the deposit book right now, it's hard to offset the deposits fully. And so, an increase from here, we'd
have to call it unlikely. It's possible. But that's why we think, in general, we're looking at a $550 million to $560
million level for fourth quarter in NII, which is still good, still very strong, but would be slightly down.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
Operator: We will take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
Hey, Alex.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thanks. Hey. Good morning, everybody, and congrats to the whole team on various moves. Just to level set the
NII discussion just one more time, so, Jason, sounds like Q3 had $10 million to $15 million of sort of elevated
transactional activity. Do you expect that to basically fall off in Q4? And that's what's partially driving the kind of
the sequential decline, and maybe expand on kind of what those were? And on deposits, this is the right jumping
off point to use as far as cost of deposits go, right? And then, obviously deposit betas are likely to be fairly high
from there. But I'm just kind of trying to level set on the go-forward potentially beyond the fourth quarter guidance
that you've highlighted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, let me try and go in the reverse order. On deposits on the launch point, feel like this is a good level. And
then if I come back to the third quarter items, there's the core, this asset and liability pricing. But there's also
another element of – you get FX swap activity, FHLB dividends, premium AM, FTE adjustments, repo activity,
leverage, and there's a whole basket of other things. It doesn't add up to a lot, but – and there's – usually there's
puts and takes in that. Most of those went in our direction this quarter. And so, that's that $10 million to $15 million
elevation.
But the way you ask the question is thoughtful, because we actually don't expect all those to just go away into the
next quarter. It's just, part of it is the environment, the way it is right now with the way rates are, it gives us more of
an opportunity to do more FX swaps and to have other activity that adds to NII. And so, we don't expect that lift to
fully come down. It gives more of an explanation of why we saw the elevation going from second to third quarter.
And so, that $550 million to $560 million largely is a reflection of some of those items going to more normalized
levels, but also impact of rate actions with different central banks that are going to have a drag on the $569
million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. All right, thank you for clarifying that. And then a question on expenses for you guys just with respect to
maybe longer-term expense growth algorithm. And, Mike, I heard your answer to the previous questions around
the organizational changes I think you guys have made, which are obviously substantial and hopefully can further
align the growth in the business with the expense structure.
But I guess, in the past, you talked about maybe this 5-ish percent bogey for expense growth over time, hoping to
be below that. This year is obviously shaking out to be north of 6%, and there's some market-related items and
stronger revenues to come along with that. So it's good news. But maybe help us sort of summarize, given these
changes, where you expect the firm's kind of longer-term expense growth to be over the next kind of a couple of
years.

Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, Alex, we're continuing to be focused on driving positive fee operating leverage and positive operating
leverage. With the level of our expense-to-trust fee ratio at this point for this quarter, year-to-date it's still above
our target range of 105% to 110%. So, we want to continue to grind that down into that target range. And likewise,
from a margin perspective, pre-tax margin, I want to be in the low-30s as a target area as well. So, that's the first
driving goal.
And then to accomplish that, we've had strong revenues this year, which has enabled us to achieve the leverage
that we have. That said, can't always count on the strength in the markets and a rate environment that may drive
that. So we need to bring the absolute expense growth rate down further. And so, that will be the objective as we
go into 2025 is to achieve that operating leverage and also increase the probability of hitting it by driving down our
expense growth rate below the level that it's been.

Okay. So, couple of questions here. One on, Mike, you mentioned the deepening of relationships as a key focus
for growth going forward. Could you help us understand how that pivot is affected? Is that different from what
11

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
you've been doing before? Is it more – just thinking of the last conversation, is it more resources to hire or is it
more products to deliver?
And then, how should we be thinking about where in the organization you have the most opportunity? Is this
Asset Servicing, Asset Management? Is it investment management? Is it the Wealth platform? Help us
understand how you're thinking about where the pockets of opportunity are richest for those deepening of
relationships?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, Betsy, to your point, that is our One Northern Trust strategy, which is to ensure that all the businesses
and all the groups within the company are working together to produce the best outcomes for our clients and
likewise for other stakeholders. And from a client perspective, it is a combination of a number of things. So, first, it
is the businesses working more closely right from the beginning, if you will.
So, going to market and opportunities, so for example, with Asset Servicing and Asset Management, providing an
overall solution for clients as opposed to necessarily starting with one and then trying to cross-sell, if you will, the
second opportunity on that front? As far as where the opportunities are, definitely between Asset Servicing and
Asset Management, but I would also highlight with Wealth Management as well. A lot of work has been done to
ensure that the linkages between those two businesses are very strong, and that we are thinking about the needs
of our Wealth Management clients as we produce new investment management products.
As I mentioned, we launched a number of new funds this year that were really off of the back of the research that
was done for some of the needs of our specific client base. We'll continue to do that in order to provide the right
solutions for them. Also, as far as the types of capabilities that we have to deliver, to your point, it is new products
or new services. So I mentioned the Artemis example. That's just the latest client where we're providing a new
capability to them of outsourced trading, what we call Integrated Trading Solutions, which we launched a number
of years ago and we've built that business up and taken this to a level where that capability works for clients of
size like Artemis. So a lot of opportunity on that front as well. And so, as you can see – oh, go ahead.

Thanks very much for those examples. That was very useful. I just wonder holistically then, as we're thinking
about not just the expense line, but just the overall impact on profitability, when you think about what you're
looking to accomplish and the opportunities you see in this pivot, how do you think that's going to translate into
return on tangible or return on common equity?

Yeah. So, there's no question that, to the extent we already have the client relationship, that the incremental
services that we provide to them are more scalable for us. And so, that's where it translates into more profitability
overall.
The second thing I would mention, Betsy, on that front is in thinking about the type of business that we're pursuing
the most. As we say, we want more scalable growth on that front. And what we really mean on that front is
focusing on new opportunities that require less in the way of new resources.
So, to the extent that we can win the business that is again more scalable for us, areas where we've had a lot of
success, for example, this year with asset owners in America, but also in Europe where we're providing custody to
them in a way that the incremental resources required, both in people but also in technology, are less than if we
are adding other services or to other segments that would require that. That translates into a higher level of
profitability overall. So, that's the objective on that front.

Good morning, Mike. How are you?

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good. Well, I see, 135 years, best-in-class, private banking relationships, all the One Northern Trust initiative
and everything else happening. And then I see a stock price that has lost its premium versus its trust bank peers
and even trades 3 points below Morgan Stanley or something. So, I'm just wondering, how much – and maybe
this is an opportunity, and if it is, you're going to let us know why, but how much of this is business mix? How
much of this is the environment? And how much of this is execution?
And I hear what you have to say, strategy drives structure, drives execution, should drive results. And I guess that
would drive the stock price. But I'm just trying to wonder that, how or why the same cast of characters can
generate better organic growth in their new roles.
And I saw the press release come out with the CFO and CEO and Head of Wealth and Head of Asset Servicing
and Head of Family Office, all changing at the same time. I just haven't seen something like that or I don't recall
something like that. So, Mike, you have a big perspective on that. So if you'd give that perspective on why you
think this will change, Mike, thanks.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, Mike, it's a combination of both putting people into the new roles where we can leverage their
experience, but also we've brought in talent from the outside. So, just over about a year ago, year and a half ago,
we brought in Daniel Gamba to run Asset Management. And so, we want to have both the benefit of people who
really understand everything you talked about as far as Northern Trust and how we're client-focused, but also new
blood and new ideas from the outside. And we'll continue to do that as we go forward.
Also to drive it, it does come back to execution, I mean, as to where we're focused. And so that's what we're trying
to drive. That's where we spend our time on that front. And that will then ultimately drive not only the earnings, but
also the multiple for the stock.
I think that another big part of this is the strategy around where that growth comes from. So that's why when we
talk about the One Northern Trust aspect of it and the type of growth, that also affects the stability and growth rate
of the earnings as well. So it's not just the earnings themselves, but it's the quality, as you know. So that's what
it's all directed at to ultimately create value through the earnings and the multiple to drive the stock price.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then maybe just to ask one follow-up, so the incremental extra that we might be able to expect by that fresh
perspective the managers bring in their new roles, maybe, Dave, as it relates to the CFO function, I know Jason is
right next to you, but incrementally, what would you like to emphasize a little bit more? Maybe it's already started.
And, Jason, what would you like to emphasize a little bit more in Wealth to take it to the next level? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, what I would emphasize with those two, and then I do think it's a good opportunity for Jason just to give
his initial thoughts here, but it is around the more scalable parts of our company overall, so not just products or
service, but company, and that is our Wealth Management business and our Asset Management business.
So, we are trying to grow those businesses organically faster than we have in the past. And so that's the tilt or the
push, Mike, on that front. And I think what Dave, you and others will quickly get comfortable with, his deep
understanding of the business, his strategic approach to it, and also understanding of value creation. But, Jason,
do you want to talk just a little bit about just some of your initial views?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Sure, Mike. So, obviously, I've already been on the road a lot and I know the business reasonably well, and
just spent time just the last few weeks, LA, New York, Texas. I'm going to a really good client event tonight in San
Francisco. But I do think there's opportunity for us to do more. And a framework to think about, Mike, is – one way
you can think about the business, the markets that we're in, the segments that we're in, which gets to where do
we have specialization that we can deepen and hope to leverage more, and then different solutions for our clients.
And you know really well, we have a phenomenal client base and great talent across the organization. And so, I
think it's very clear that there is more that we can do and using that framework as a way that I think we can talk
about it in the future, where we're putting the initiatives in each of those different dimensions to try to grow the
business faster.

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
All right. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: We will take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning, Brennan. How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I'm good. I'm good. Thanks for taking my question. So, I actually wanted to circle back on expenses. And totally
appreciate the commitment that was made to operating leverage in driving down the expenses to fees. But based
on the fourth quarter guide, I think my quick math suggested that we're going to be north of 6% on expense
growth in 2024.
And, Jason, as your sort of last act as at least CFO in name, right, right before the press release went out, you
had said that you made another commitment to keep 2025 sub-5%. And so, Dave is an internal candidate. So,
does that 2025 commitment hold with the new CFO? How should we think about it?
And, like, importantly, I understand operating leverage matters and whatnot, but expense growth has really been
an issue. It's gotten more elevated here recently, in recent years compounded a bit with inflation, but it's not a
new issue for Northern. How is it that you guys can get this under control to a point where you can have a more
steady cadence of operating leverage without having the bar quite high?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, Brennan, part of it is the organizational change. So, just fundamentally, that will involve centralizing a
number of operations that are now more distributed. And so, it's more than just, I'll say, committing to it. It's
actually making changes to do that.
The other part of it is you have to make the investments where they're required and when they're required. That's
part of managing this for the long term. And in the environment that we've been in, as far as just the – I'll call it,
the level of volatility and risk that's in the broader environment, we felt that making these investments in the
foundation is the right thing to do longer term.
Now that does require or create some level of variability in what those are. But when we think about what we're
doing on the technology front, for example, the modernization that Jason has mentioned, where it's quickly trying
to move off of end-of-life platforms, transitioning to the cloud, which definitely requires investment to do,
increasing the automation of the changes we make within technology, ensuring we have redundancy to the extent
that there are incidence, doing more testing of all of those platforms to ensure that we have the stability on that
front, making sure that when we are working with third-party providers that we understand their resiliency as well.
So there's a number of things that we've done and are doing to kind of harden and solidify that core, because we
think that's a good investment for it, not just from a, I'll say, risk and resiliency perspective, but also from a client
15

experience perspective and also from an efficiency perspective. So that's why we've tried to be very clear on what
we're doing and why we're doing it and why we think ultimately, not only is that good for the clients, but it's good
for shareholders as well. It's going to drive high-quality growth as we go forward, and that's the plan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. I look forward to getting some meat on those bones in the coming quarter. So that's great. If I could
transition to the balance sheet, it looks like loans pulled back a decent amount this quarter. I don't think you
touched on it. What caused that, and how should we be thinking about loan growth or the outlook for any growth
or further decline in balances from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. I've noted before, the loans and deposits can be very spiky. And the headline is, there's nothing strategic or
creating of a trend that we see and what we experienced in the quarter. And then in terms of growth going
forward, we've had initiatives in the past to specifically grow the loan book. We don't have that initiative right now.
We're not trying to shrink it either.
And so, you should think about growth in the loan book coming alongside growth in the overall client franchise. A
lot of our lending, ironically, the deposits are more on the institutional side. The lending is more on the Wealth
side of the business. And so, the correlation will be more tied to growth in the Wealth business.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Maybe another question on the Wealth side, like, we always want to grow Wealth. It's a great
business, and you're great at it. You talked about the concept. Maybe drill down a little bit more, because I think
you've been making some investments in people, products, and new geographies. Maybe talk a little bit about that
and include maybe a comment about the Hamilton Lane collaboration that you mentioned – that you had a press
release on yesterday. Thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So I'll start. So I think what you should see is us investing even more aggressively at the upper end. We do
really well at the high end of the market. And you see it very clearly in what Dave has been able to do with the
GFO business, because that's the – on average those are our largest clients, and that's been growing faster than
the rest of Wealth. If you were to look beneath that, you'd be able to see that even within the regions, we're doing
better at the higher end. That's where our franchise and that's where our value proposition holds well and we feel
great about that. We can invest even more heavily there, in revenue-generating, in client-generating
professionals, and in the talent that supports those clients from an experience perspective.
So, a lot of RIAs brag about having one or maybe two ACTEC Fellows, and those are the most respected people
in trust and estate planning. Northern has 15 or 20. And so, when clients are trying to go deeper in their estate
work, more complicated planning, we've got the professionals to do that. And that's part of the reason why just in
that area, we do well, but also the same thing in investment advising and in banking. And so, the more we invest
at the upper end of the market, that's where we feel we're going to have a better return.
So, we announced a distinct ultra-high-net-worth group just this past quarter. And we're dedicating professionals
to just that area, where they're going to be dealing with clients at the very upper end of wealth advisory and
working closely with the family office business to bring those capabilities into the more traditional Wealth space for
us. And so, there's a lot of things we were excited about that where we feel we're planting seeds for growth. And
then I also look at just the talent we're able to bring on board, really exciting hires across the franchise that we
think are going to be helpful to growing the business, growing the client franchise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
And, Glenn, on Hamilton Lane, that is a partnership that we're excited about, which is with our Asset Servicing
business to provide even better data and analytics on the private investments of our large institutional clients. As
you know, as asset allocators portfolios have moved more and more to private markets and alternatives, the
capabilities required to due diligence them, analyze them has gone up. And we've had our offering, front office
solutions, which looks across the entire portfolio that we've been very successful with, and this is an addition to
that, that will provide even better, as I said, data analytics to it. So, very positive and promising.

Hey, Gerard. How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good. How are you? Congratulations, Jason. Mike, you touched on Northern One (sic) [One Northern] (00:47:06)
a number of times in your prepared remarks as well as your answers to questions. As outsiders, investors, how
should we measure the success of what you're trying to achieve? I mean, your peers are using similar types of
programs as well or strategies. And I was wondering if you could somehow point us to some metrics that we can
review regularly just to measure your success in pursuing this strategy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure, Gerard. So, to your point using One is not unique, the fact that One Northern Trust is what is unique about
it, because it's our business that we're focused on with it. And it's something that, Gerard, is really important, I'd
say, within the company, but also in the marketplace. Within the company, we want to make sure that we're
breaking down silos and that everybody across the company, regardless of what business or group you're in, are
working together in order to get the right outcomes.
And that can be certainly as we've talked about on the client front, but it can also be in ensuring that we're getting
the right efficiencies across the businesses. So, that cuts across that way. And then, as I mentioned, certainly
going to market and with the client, we're stronger as Northern Trust than we are as any one of our businesses
alone. So that's what's behind it.
To your point on measuring it, the way that we're doing it is we start with the specific objectives of what we're
trying to do. So, thinking about specifically, I mentioned, okay, how many times did we go to market with a new
opportunity where involved two or all three of our businesses to do that. That's something that we can measure,
granted it's an internal measurement or metric, but it has to start there if it's going to flow through to the KPIs that
– the key performance indicators that we're then looking at, which really then it's going to be in our organic growth
rate.
And so, that's what we're trying to drive is a higher organic growth rate. And so, to do that, we need to see that
collaboration between the businesses. That then flows into our financial performance overall when you add into it
the markets and the impact from that. So, ultimately, you're going to see it in the financial performance and we
can provide, I'll say, some KPIs as we go forward here. That's part of what I mentioned with Steve Fradkin, who,
as you know, has worked across all of these businesses in one way or another over his career. And that's why
we're looking to not just say One Northern Trust, but actually ensure that we're doing it by operationalizing a lot of
those activities.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Jason, coming back, I know you touched on the net interest income expectations for the fourth quarter. And with
the balance sheet duration, I think you said the entire balance sheet is about a year, and securities portfolio is a
little longer than that. If the forward curve is correct, and we do see a Fed funds rate by the end of next year in
that 3.5% range, let's call it, and the long end of the curve stays anchored above 4%, so we get a positive slope in
the curve. I'm not asking for a guidance number on 2025 NII. But generally, is that a favorable net interest income
environment for you folks? Or can you share some color there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
For various reasons, we came shorter on the securities portfolio. And so, the rest of the balance sheet is pretty
stable. Cash is what it is. And the loan book, we haven't done anything to strategically change the duration of that
effectively. So, the duration of the balance sheet and NII moves largely with what we do with the securities
portfolio. And we did come shorter, that played out well for us. We did it for a variety of reasons. One was a view
of the yield curve, and again, that played out well for us.
At this point, if we look at what the yield curve is telling us, it's obviously going to be more of a headwind going
into next year. So, especially if we see five, six, seven rate cuts, there's – we're not going to change our risk
tolerances, our philosophy, our approach on how we manage the balance sheet. So that's going to be a
headwind.
That said, there are some offsets to it that are occurring just in how we normally manage the portfolio for
advancements. One, we are feeling better about the stability of the deposit level. So, that gives us the ability to
consider using more [indiscernible] (00:52:09). Second is we did see a rise effectively in the base of the deposit
book, and so we think deposit levels are positive. And then there's still a slight benefit in the next year from the
reinvestment of securities that are maturing, not as much as what we would have seen before, but there is some.
And so, those are just some of the puts and takes. And you're right, it's too early for us to give a guidance, but I
did want to make sure people realize all the different factors that are playing into it. There are some puts as well
as the takes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And is it fair to say that – I think you pointed it out to us in your Q when you give us the interest
sensitivity table that you guys are asset sensitive presently at the end of third quarter. Is that a fair statement?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. And thanks for clarifying that. I should have mentioned that in my summary of where we are, Gerard. So,
there is slight asset sensitivity at this point, just largely coming from the actions we've taken in the balance sheet
over the last couple of years.

Jason J. Tyler A

Good morning, Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning and congrats to you and everyone else on the organizational changes. Hey, a question for
you, Jason, and Mike could chime in too maybe. But just going back to the organic growth comments, and I
appreciate all of the comments you've discussed in Q&A. In the Wealth segment, first and foremost, I think we're
focusing on organic revenue growth as opposed to asset growth. So I just want to confirm that.
And do you see more of that organic growth coming internally? So, from, let's say, selling more or providing more
Northern Trust investment managed product, say, doing more lending potentially within the Wealth segment,
other things that you can do internally as opposed to getting new customers. So, would we see more of the
organic growth, revenue growth coming from that? And if you could just think of, maybe just what type of target
organic growth rate are you looking for in Wealth over time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, let me start with the end. We have talked about somewhere around a 3% level of organic growth for the
business overall. We've historically said that we'd like to see that we should expect a higher amount coming from
Asset Servicing and a little bit lower amount from Wealth. I think we should try to be more – have more of an
expectation that that's balanced. And so, I think in the medium-term, a 2.5% to 3% number for Wealth is
reasonable.
If we start to break it down of where that's coming from, it's got to be a combination of both new clients and doing
more with existing clients. But within the existing client base, there's a lot of different categories that people
should think about. And I want to try and focus on a couple to give a sense of where we're focusing, because it's
less for us about thinking about more product utilization. We've talked about that, but it's not something that we
would aggressively target. And even more lending, if that comes organically within our philosophy and risk
tolerances, great, but not an area where we see we're going to be pushing the envelope and changing our risk
tolerances.

Northern Trust Corp.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
And so, it's more thinking about our wallet share with clients, thinking about different solutions we can do with
them. And also, at the upper end of the market, to the extent that our overall client base shifts that way, those
clients are still in a mode of they still gain wealth. And so, their growth becomes our growth. And our view is that
that's organic as well, if they're creating more flows into our business, not their market growth, which we don't
think of as organic, but their new flows coming into the company. Then you couple that with what we should be
able to do from a new client perspective, and that's how we're thinking about getting to that organic growth target
level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Super helpful. And then maybe just a couple clean-up questions. Just one on loan pricing, it looks like the yields
went up. Is that a factor of the lag? I think you've got about – correct me if I'm wrong, but I think three quarters of
the book prices within three months, that's variable rate, and then there's a portion that prices over a longer time
period. So just maybe if you can talk about the pricing relative to rates in that book.
And then just one on expenses, and thanks for all the commentary on expenses, it's great. One question there
would be that expense growth, which just looks like 6% this year, you're targeting to bring that down. If you have a
really strong revenue year and you're generating positive operating leverage on total revenue and your expense
trust fees is moving towards your goal, is it possible that you'd still have expense growth that could be 6% or
higher in that scenario?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, first on the lags, you got them right in terms of the month lag. But just keep in mind there's a small portion in
both business that is daily as well, that's tied more to the extent that clients have more mutual funds. But that's a
small dynamic. But you're right, in general, on the month lag.
And then, on the expense growth and, Mike likely would want to comment on it here, one of the things we talked
about last year was that we want to try to decouple this, the concept of if we have a strong revenue growth, that
should lead to a higher expense growth. Now, some of that is inevitable, because if we're growing the business,
there are some expenses that are going to come along with it. We've talked about the impact of markets on
expenses.
But in general, we're trying to get away from that dynamic of projecting higher revenue growth, and therefore
tolerating higher expense growth. It has to be more of an absolute. And so, that's why next year – we came into
this year with good confidence about being able to do 5% or less. Coming to next year, confidence level is even
higher.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A

Yes. Yes. Thanks for that. Just on the pricing, I was talking about the loans, the variable rate loans on that, not
the market. So, is it three quarters of the book, I think, was of the loans were variable rate and reset within three
months and the quarter resets later? So the lag is what drove the yield up this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
No, overdrafts were a little bit higher. That's what drove the yield up. Thanks. I really appreciate you clarifying
that. And it is about – it's 70% to 80% that's floating in the loan book.

Operator: We will take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
Morning, Jim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Jason, yeah, good morning. Just maybe on the capital return, you guys have been stepping up the buybacks.
Capital ratios are pretty flat, and as you pointed out, still well above the minimum. So, is this something we should
expect this level for the intermediate term as profitability improves and rates are pretty stable, so OCI looks good?
Can you keep this level up or is this sort of a high watermark on the buyback side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
It's maybe neither. And so, it is elevated, but it could stay elevated for a while. And if I walk through the pieces, if
you think about, we have about a third of the net income going to dividends at this point. We talk about it being
30% to 50% over time and it's right at about a third right now, if you take out the – or even actually including the
equity investment and the Visa dynamic. But us being at 12.5% or 12.6%, that's the upper end of where we have
been in CET1. Now we've been at that level before, and so we're comfortable at that level, but it's the upper end.
But Visa, monetizing that obviously put a lot of liquidity available for share repurchase. And so, we are deploying
that over time. And we could continue to do that and still be at approximately this 12.5% level, maybe it comes
down a little bit. And the reason we tolerate that is we know at this point we still have other Visa tranches coming
over the next year or two. And so, it will be another roughly equivalent benefit, and so would be okay for us to see

the CET1 come down from this 12.6% a little bit. But we're thinking about it, working through it, and not trying to
be overly aggressive at any point in time, trying to take more of a thoughtful approach over several quarters, not
trying to do anything too aggressively.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Right. Great. And then, when you think about the monetization of the second half of the Visa shares, that's
obviously a tailwind. Do you contemplate maybe in longer term, intermediate term of a lower than 12.5% CET1,
given the excess you have, can you take it to 12% or lower?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
We're talking that far in the future. I should let Mike or...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
As Jason say, 12.6% is a very strong level of capital, and that's fine given, say, the broader environment, and yet
at the same time, yeah, absolutely are comfortable at lower levels as well. So we feel very good about the capital
position and the higher level of repurchases that we had in this quarter and as we move into next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC

Operator: We will take our next question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks. Morning. Couple of questions. Firstly, Mike, Jason, you all mentioned the incremental spending for
resilience, modernization, et cetera. That's what's driven your expense growth to the 6% level. How much has that
added? Would you say it's a couple hundred basis points to the growth rate this year? And if that goes away in
three quarters, does that bring you down to – [indiscernible] (01:03:37) below in the second half of next year? Any
more clarification on that? Any more color on that?

Yes. So, Vivek, I think it's difficult to, I'll say, do an attribution on the 6% and then project that all going forward. I
do think that one indication of the growth in the areas that I talked about there, you see it in the higher growth rate
that we have in equipment and in services. So, that's where you'll see most of that technology spend come
through.
But it's not the – that doesn't make up 6%, if you will. Jason has broken it down before. There are other
components that drive overall, including the fact that we are levered to the market, both on the revenue side and
on the expense side. So that's an aspect of what drove the rate to 6% this year.
As we go forward, as we've talked about, Vivek, certainly looking to bring that down. But we'll make the
investments we need in technology and just more broadly to be able to accomplish what we want to overall.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Separate question for you, Mike. There was a question earlier about the organizational changes. Why not
use this opportunity where you're making such a lot of changes at one shot to bring in some more talent from the
outside?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Over time, Vivek, we will continue to do a combination of both. And so, there are a number of roles, some
of which we talked about here, but other roles, which we will go to market and bring in external talent. For some
time period that has been the strategy on management. I mean, as you know as much as you might say, Jason or
Dave or myself have been at Northern for some time period. But we had actually been at other places longer than
we've been at Northern.
So, it's a mix between promoting talent within, because we think we have strong talent that we developed, and
having a strong talent development program, if you will, is a big part of what we want to do and, at the same time
bringing in talent from the outside. So, there will be plenty of opportunities to be able to do that.

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. So, did I hear you right, you said you're targeting organic growth in Wealth of 2.5% to 3%? How does that
compare to the last few years? And when you benchmark that versus peers, how does that stack up? When you
see growth in the offstage, private equity, some other brokers, it just seems like it's more than that. And maybe it's
just the sandbox where you compete. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & President-Wealth Management, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, couple of things. One, it's that would be higher than what it's been over the last couple of years. It's
been lower than that over the last couple of years. Before that, we had been within that target range. And so,
we've done it before and that's why we feel confident we can do it again. And then, from comparative purposes,
there are some firms that are doing better than that and some that are doing worse. We want to be a winner. We
want to be at the top end of that range. And I also think it's very hard to compare. Some firms include banking,
some firms don't. Some firms include their product fees, some firms don't.
And our model also is from a profitability perspective because of our financial model that we can do better from an
earnings perspective if relative to our peers, if we do same amount of growth, that's our – the profitability and the
incremental profitability of our Wealth business is very strong. That's why – that's part of the reason it's such a
good business. The clients are embedded, and they're institutionalized. And it makes it so that our growth leads to
better economics for shareholders. And so, we feel really good about the – feel good about that target and what it
would mean for shareholders.
