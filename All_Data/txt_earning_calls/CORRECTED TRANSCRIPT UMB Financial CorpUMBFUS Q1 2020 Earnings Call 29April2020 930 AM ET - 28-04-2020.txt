are on a diluted share basis. Our presentation materials and press release are available online at

Now, I'll turn the call over to Mariner Kemper.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kay, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I hope you and all your family and friends are safe
and healthy. Our thoughts are with the most impacted by this pandemic and our deepest gratitude goes to those
on the frontlines, including healthcare workers and first responders.
I'm going to go off script a bit this morning. Like everyone on this call, I've had a great deal of time over the last 45
days to think and prepare for what lies ahead. In my 25 years at UMB, 16 of those as CEO, I've primarily been a
risk manager. I've come to believe a few simple truths about what we're likely to experience over the next couple
of years. I believe that CECL is the worst designed accounting rule in US history, poorly timed and horribly
mismanaged by FASB and the accounting industry. If we were to return to the incurred loss model, investors
would have a much easier time understanding the underlying risk at any particular bank. But that's not a reality.
And with CECL now deployed, it will nearly be impossible to understand the actual risk that exists in a bank's
portfolio. However, the unintended consequence of this should be that we're all more prepared for the unknown
risks ahead.
What I do know is that it's better to be prepared for the worst rather than only preparing for outcomes that would
be better. With all that as a backdrop, I'll share with you the three most important things to focus on as we look at
what lies ahead. First, capital and liquidity are king. None of us has any idea how bad this crisis will be, no matter
what any self-proclaimed genius will tell you and you can't have enough capital or liquidity right now. Second,
doing what's right actually matters, not only because it feels good, but it builds franchise value by bonding both
employees and our customers to UMB. We're laser-focused on helping our associates and customers manage
through these very difficult times. More on that in my prepared comments.
And lastly and importantly to you, our investors, our primary mission is to make sure that our current investors can
count on us to be standing strong at the end of this crisis and benefit alongside us when we take advantage of the
opportunities that will sure present themselves in recovery and only to those of us who are not too badly wounded
to capitalize on it.
Here's where our track record as lenders comes into play. I can't make any promises about how we'll perform
during this situation, but what I can tell you is that I will treat the money that we lend out as my own. It happens to
be the only investment I have. I, along with most of our loan committee, have been overseeing our lending
activities together for 25 years. It's easy to look good when things are good. The real test of credit quality is how it
performs when conditions are negative. We have a track record on that issue. We outperformed nearly every
bank in the 2008 crisis.
In conclusion, UMB is always preparing for the worst. We have strong capital levels and a very strong liquidity
position, along with the loan-to-deposit ratio that allows us to be there for our customers. We've demonstrated to
our customers and employees that we put them first. And, lastly, most importantly, we have a credit team that is
battle-tested with superior results when it matters in times of crisis.
Now, I'll return to the comments that we prepared. This quarter's release and investor call are certainly not
routine. Our focus today is less on quarterly results and more on how we're responding to protect and support our

associates, customers, and communities, along with details on our portfolio and how we're positioned to operate
through this crisis. We came into this crisis in good position with healthy capital levels and a balance sheet that
gives us flexibility.
While we don't know how long this current environment will last, we are prepared and in true to our style, we have
taken a conservative stance with our positioning. First, I'd like to share some of the actions we've taken in light of
the rapidly changing environment. Operationally, we activated our business continuity plans on March 16 and took
steps to protect our associates and customers.
UMB was one of the first in our region to move to drive-through only service in our branches and we were able to
quickly transition much of our team to remote work model. We put additional safety practices in place, as well as
adding supplemental compensation and additional [ph] PTO (00:06:29) days for roles that can't be performed
offsite. Our technology, digital and online banking platforms have performed well, and we've been able to continue
to serve and support customers on an uninterrupted basis.
Now, I'll turn to our first quarter results announced yesterday afternoon. You'll see that on a GAAP basis, we
recorded a net loss of $3.4 million, driven by the impact and adoption of CECL, which resulted in significantly
higher provision expense based on how the economic models calculate the possibility of future credit losses
under the extreme conditions created by the COVID-19 crisis.
Excluding this impact, business and financial results remained strong and demonstrated by a 5.6% increase in
pre-tax, pre-provision income to $83.7 million from a linked quarter. To-date, we've seen our peer group report a
median increase of 3% in PTPP income. Unfortunately, the ill-timed adoption of CECL methodology during this
unprecedented macro environment has resulted in additional volatility at a critical time. This has made comparing
financial institutions across the banking industry extremely difficult, if not impossible. Given all the subjectivity that
has gone into these calculations, including the source and date of economic forecasts, the industry has spent
months creating and testing CECL models, but they weren't meant to operate with such significant movements in
unemployment rates, GDP expectations, interest rates, and economic forecasts, especially in such a compressed
timeframe.
Arguably, not all unemployment rates are created equal. While today's rate has now exceeded peak levels seen
during the 2007/2009 recession, different industries are being impacted this time at varying degrees. Each bank's
loan portfolio is inherently different and national unemployment rates aren't always relevant. Additionally, banks
such as UMB who have less reliance on consumer lending, including credit card and mortgage, will likely see their
portfolios react differently. Another consideration is the extraordinary amount of fiscal stimulus that is being
injected into addressing this crisis.
For context, during the prior financial crisis when [ph] unemployment (00:09:03) rates jumped from 4% to 10%
over a 12-quarter period, our cumulative losses were only 1% of our balances, with over half of that in the card
portfolio. Our performance was the second best in our midsized peer group. For comparison, credit card balances
were 7% of our loans in the 2009 crisis compared to just under 3% during this crisis.
UMB has always had a reputation for being responsive, consistent, and conservative as it relates to credit. We
are quick to get in front of problems, quick to move credits to the watch list, but most importantly, we have a good
track record of keeping rank credits from moving to loss based on our relationships with our clients.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2020
The CECL methodology makes it more difficult to provision in a way that we feel is appropriate for what we know
about the quality of our portfolio. We've provided some additional information beginning on slide 9 of our materials
and Ram will discuss those in more detail shortly.
Aside from the CECL impact, our asset quality was strong, with net charge-offs of 0.23% of average loans. Our
provision of $88 million under CECL equates to 11.5 times net charge-offs of $7.7 million for the first quarter and
nearly 11 times the last four quarters' average provision. And another compelling statistic, our reserves to non-
performing assets, which has historically been above peer averages, stands at 1.9 times compared to peer
median of 1.6 times.
Average loans increased 11.6% on a linked quarter annualized basis. On an end of period basis, growth was
3.9% compared to the year-end of 2019. [ph] Our (00:11:07) top line loan production of $816 million and a net
increase in revolving balances of $321 million was partially offset by $611 million of payoffs and paydowns. The
growth in commercial loans in the first quarter included approximately $388 million in net line draw activity. Line
utilization at March 31 was 41% compared to 39% at year end. Similar to what we've heard from other banks,
draw activity has slowed in April as shown on slide 13.
In early March, we began proactively reaching out to our clients, we knew, could be more severely impacted by
the impending economic crisis. Our entire business banking customer base, largely our practice finance portfolio
of dentists, doctors, and professionals was offered a six-month deferral to help them weather the storm.
Through our usual relationship management process, we've been working towards customized solutions for other
borrowers and including the business banking deferrals I mentioned before, we have received requests for
modifications on approximately $1.7 billion of our loan portfolio or about 12% of the book. The breakdown of those
requests by client type can be found on slide 13. This is similar to the levels reported in industry [ph] surveys
(00:12:34).
When the SBA's Paycheck Protection Plan Program opened up, we were ready and moved quickly. We were able
to process and get approved 3,000 applications for more than $1.4 billion in funded loans. These loans have
ranged in size from $2,000 to $10 million with a median of $122,000. I'm extremely proud of how our team
stepped up to provide this critical support to our clients and we were ready to step back in with a backlog of
another 1,700 applications when the second phase of the program began on Monday.
Now, I'll turn it over to Ram to discuss some of the drivers of our results, then I'll come back and provide a little
more detail on the composition of our loan portfolio. Ram?

Ram Shankar

Thank you, Mariner. I'll begin with comments on CECL and the drivers of our increased allowance for credit
losses, which [ph] began (00:13:36) back on slide 9. On adoption on January 1, our allowance for credit losses
increased by 8.8% or $9 million to $110.8 million. Net charge-offs drove a reduction of $7.7 million and portfolio
changes, including loan growth and mix and qualitative changes, added $21.2 million. For the economic outlook
adjustment of $66.8 million under the CECL model, we used the March 27 Moody's baseline economic forecast.
This brings our total allowance to $191.1 million at March 31. The reserve build added 59 basis points to
allowance to loan coverage which was 1.4% at quarter-end.
Our econometric models are built on regressions and correlations during the prior financial crisis to changes in
some of the key economic variables applied to our loan portfolio. As we disclosed last quarter, some of these key

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2020
variables considered in our model today include the unemployment rate and treasury rates. We have taken a
conservative approach to our CECL modeling in light of the volatility and frequent changes in economic
expectations, especially when you consider the modest at-risk portfolio disclosures that Mariner will address
shortly. Approximately two-thirds of the increase in our allowance can be attributed to our C&I portfolio.
Since the end of the first quarter and subsequent to finalizing our CECL estimate, the economic forecasts have
deteriorated further than our model inputs, including conditions that are materially worse than prior recessionary
periods and what most models were built off. But we've also seen an unprecedented amount of fiscal stimulus
being injected to address the crisis, with likely more to come. Additionally, unlike prior recessions, this crisis has
the potential to correct meaningfully in a very shortened timeframe.
The direction of our future reserves will depend on more observable trends within our portfolio and loan growth,
coupled with macroeconomic forecast that will be available at the measurement date at the end of the quarter.
Other factors, such as the shape, timing and magnitude of the recovery, will also play a part in assessing future
allowance levels. It is important to note that our first quarter provision isn't an indicator of a run rate for the
remainder of the year.
Now, looking at the quarterly results, net interest income of $173.9 million represents an increase of $1.6 million
from the fourth quarter, driven by the 11.6% annualized growth in average loans and excess liquidity and along
with decreased deposit costs. Total earning asset yields fell 18 basis points to 3.58% from the linked quarter,
driven largely by a 23-basis-point decline in loan yields. Interest-bearing deposit costs also declined 18 basis
points for a beta of 44%. As the rate cuts were in March, we'll see this impact more clearly in the second quarter.
Net interest spread increased 1 basis point, despite a 150-basis-point reduction in short-term interest rates. Net
interest margin compressed by 5 basis points from the fourth quarter driven almost entirely by the declining
benefit of free funds. The positive impact from lower interest-bearing liabilities was offset by loan yields repricing.
As stated, fee income was $98.4 million for the quarter and reflected some impacts from the volatile markets,
including negative market valuation adjustments to a few line items. The largest reduction was in company-owned
life insurance or COLI income, which decreased $16.6 million compared to the fourth quarter.
Additionally, derivative income and the valuation of some other investments in our trading inventory were
impacted as discussed in our earnings release. Expenses for the quarter decreased 7.3% or $14.8 million
compared to the fourth quarter, largely related to a $15.7 million reduction in deferred comp expense, the offset to
the reduced COLI income I mentioned. Partial offsets included typical and seasonal increases of $8.1 million in
payroll taxes, medical insurance, and 401(k) expense in the first quarter. Additional details on non-interest income
and expense can be found on slides 5 through 7 as you analyze our results.
We continue to maintain strong regulatory capital ratios with the CET1 ratio of 11.9% based on the adoption of
interagency guidance for regulatory capital transition and average tangible common equity to tangible assets of
9.7%. During the quarter, we repurchased just over 1 million shares at an average price of $53.79 through both
open market repurchases and an accelerated share repurchase program. We have no additional plans for share
repurchases at this time other than the completion and the settlement of the ASR entered into in early March.
Our tangible book value per share increased to $51.04 at the end of the quarter, up 16.1% from a year ago. For
comparison, our peers that have reported so far have shown an increase of 9.1%. Regulatory capital ratios are
shown on slide 16.

Finally, in addition to our lower loan-to-deposit ratio, we have multiple primary and secondary sources of liquidity
to support our customers.
Now, I'll hand it back to Mariner to go into the details on our loan book.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thanks, Ram. A snapshot of our loan composition at the end of the first quarter is shown on slide 21 and we have
a breakdown of our commercial portfolios by asset class on the following pages. Our C&I book, shown on slide
23, stood at $6.2 billion at the end of the quarter, representing 44.2% of our total book. The portfolio with well-
diversified by industry.
Our commercial real estate portfolio detail begins on page 24. Our total CRE portfolio stood at $5.3 billion at the
end of the quarter, and approximately 40% is comprised of owner occupied [ph] and (00:20:23) real estate
farmland and residential construction. The remaining 60% is investment CRE where our largest exposures are
multifamily, industrial properties, and office buildings. While loan-to-value ratios vary by property type, the
average is 63%. You'll see the full mix and other detail on slide 25. We have many long-term relationships with
sponsors who have managed through prior economic cycles and we are primarily a recourse lender. Our
investment CRE portfolio overall is 90% recourse.
Next, on slide 26, we've called out our exposure to industries that are viewed as having more exposure to the
pandemic, with additional detail on how we're viewing those. We identified the five categories shown, then looked
at each for specific characteristics or specific credits that we feel comfortable with, as well as those which we may
think carry more risk if the current environment is prolonged. The balances shown in the column labeled
Potentially More Impacted Subset are those we're monitoring more closely, and you'll see that amounts to just
under 9% of our total loan book. I don't think it's appropriate to make a blanket statement about a particular
industry or category as that's not how we look at our book. We know our customers well and have an active dialog
with them in all environments. We generally have strong sponsors. And as I mentioned, our CRE book is largely
recourse.
I'll begin with our oil and gas portfolio and the breakdown by segment is shown on that same slide. We had $457
million outstanding at the end of the quarter, representing 3.3% of total loans, which has remained steady since
the last time oil prices were in focus in 2014 and 2015. Many of our energy clients have been with us for years
and we've worked with them through the last cycle. We have strong equity sponsors in place for much of the book
and many customers are well-hedged against oil price volatility.
As shown in the table, $215 million of the oil and gas portfolio is currently receiving more scrutiny and is
comprised of credits in the service sector, as those customers are the most impacted in this environment and a
few of our upstream credits that are more heavily dependent on oil prices and possibly have less protection in
place. This brings us to a total in the More Impacted column for our oil and gas loans down to 1.5% of total loans.
In CRE, our multifamily and student portfolios – student housing portfolios had a combined $664 million
outstanding at quarter-end, 14% of which is for projects under construction that are not expected to come to
market within the next six months. The largest portion of our multifamily loans are for Class A developments. We
have not yet heard of significant stress, but a longer shutdown or deeper recession could obviously impact the
professional workforce as well and we are in close communication with our clients.

This book is 87% recourse and weighted average LTVs are 59% for multifamily and 67% for student housing.
This brings the total in the More Impacted column for multifamily down to 2.6% of total loans. Retail CRE of $445
million is broadly diversified and a substantial portion carries guarantees from top sponsors, 38% is grocery-
anchored retail centers and less than 5% is for properties that are majority occupied by restaurants. This book is
90% recourse and has a weighted average LTV of 61%. This brings the total in the more Impacted Column for
retail CRE down to 1.7% of total loans.
Our total hotel portfolio is $328 million, representing 2.4% of total loans and you'll see that the portion we currently
have under closer scrutiny is $201 million or 1.4% of loans. 16% of our outstanding hotel balances are under
construction and again, that excludes any that may come to market within six months. Our entire hotel portfolio is
recourse. All properties are flagged with major brand families and the majority are limited service hotels versus full
service. The weighted average loan-to-value is 62% and the average debt to service coverage ratio on our
stabilized hotel portfolio in 2019 was 1.90 times.
In our transportation service category, the largest portion of the $293 million in balances are truck transportation
and warehouse clients, and much of that group are leaders in the industry with strong net worth and liquidity. We
have minimal exposure to passenger travel or tour companies, which are less than 1% of total loans. After review,
the more impacted portion of that book is just about 1.5% of total loans.
After an in-depth analysis, the portion of balances in these five categories that we view as being highly impacted
represents about 9% of total loan balances. Of course, this isn't any indication that we think those will all be
losses, but we will continue to keep a close watch as conditions evolve throughout this crisis.
Finally, we have a strong capital and liquidity position and a history of prudent risk management, and believe our
diverse revenue sources help provide a buffer in this interest rate environment. We've been through many crises
in our 107-year history and we're proud to work alongside our peer banks to help navigate through this one.
To wrap up, after digesting other banks' earnings this season, it's abundantly clear that there is a great deal of
subjectivity that goes into the allowance process, more so than ever. As you've heard us say, our credit
management team has been together for a long time, with an average tenure of 21 years at UMB. We take a
conservative approach and proactive approach to credit management, and remain confident that our credit quality
will remain one of our key differentiators, especially during periods of stress.
I want to recognize and thank our team members who continue to go above and beyond every day as we serve
our clients. It has brought everyone together during a difficult time, and it has reinforced what we've always
known: relationships matter.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn it over to the conference call operator for the Q&A portion of the
call. Thanks a lot

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, our first
question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of BofA, Bank of America. Please proceed.

Good morning.

Good morning, Eb.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities, Inc.
So, I guess just first on credit, so appreciate all the commentary and it's two-part question. One, just from a
quantitative perspective, on slide 10, you mentioned reserve levels at 150 basis points of projected loss under
stress scenario and we've seen all sorts of ranges there in terms of banks have been at 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, up
to that. Just talk to us in terms of the depth of downturn or economic pain assumed in that loss scenario. And is it
safe to conclude that unless we see the macro outlook deteriorate, you should be done with the reserve building
part of this?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ram, why don't you take that? It sounds like a modeling – mostly a modeling question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Hey. Good morning, Ebrahim. So, we've seen some of the peer data on that same metric, and I can't speak for
others in terms of our coverage of DFAST losses. First thing, DFAST and CECL are two different tracks. They are
completely for two different purposes, right. Obviously, DFAST is a nine-quarter outlook versus the life of the loan
contract. But I'll go back to what I said in the script, and Mariner mentioned this too, we have taken a pretty
conservative approach based on the volatility that we saw at measurement date of March 27th in the Moody's
economic forecast looking ahead. So, those are considered in. We didn't lay any negative overlays on what the
model output was in terms of some of the stimulus programs that are out there and how shallow this recession
could potentially be. So, this is pretty much a straight-up model exercise in terms of how we approach CECL with
it and then there's the DFAST, which is as I said, completely different ball game.

Got it. And I guess – so understood, so you didn't assume any lower losses relative to what the models [ph] pick
(00:30:19) out to account for the stimulus actions, if I heard you correctly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
And the stimulus actions and all the things that Mariner just walked us through...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities, Inc.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
...in terms of the at-risk portfolios, right. Within the at-risk portfolios that people have generally labeled, there's
only half of that we think we need to monitor a little bit more closely, because we have recourse and we have a lot
of different things that can protect us. So, that's not fully taken into account either.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I think also, Ebrahim, it sounds a little bit like your question is what about the second quarter and I think it's early
to try to give you too much color about what will happen in the second quarter, but what has come clear to us as it
relates to how CECL was applied by all the different banks, is that there were many, many qualitative overlays put
on by a lot of the banks and as we stare into the second quarter, being as conservative as we were, we do
believe if data were to get worse, unemployment were to get worse, that we sort of bought our way into the
second quarter at some level by being conservative in the first quarter. We do plan on doing deep analysis on the
second quarter against what the unemployment rate will be, what the stimulus is, how to apply unemployment
against different parts of our book. So, we will continue to apply qualitative analysis as we roll into the second and
third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess just a minor following up. So, you mentioned the difference in the portfolio. Credit card loans,
much smaller, [ph] they were (00:31:57) the big driver of losses last cycle. I guess the other side this you've the
bank a lot in terms of commercial lending. A lot of that has been CRE, and C&I out of market. Just talk to us in
terms of your level of confidence going into this cycle relative to [ph] your CEO (00:32:13) going into the last cycle
and just in terms of your borrower base, your confidence in the customer credit quality.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2020
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Okay. Well, I mean – again, I mean, we've been in Denver since 1995, so I don't know that I would call any of our
markets, particularly expansion markets other than – I suppose, Texas is under 10 years, but we were lending in
Texas before we opened the offices there. So, anyway, I think, really, what we've talked about before about our
loan growth is, as you'll recall, about 10 years ago, we went through an exercise, right, to penetrate the markets
that we're in by doing a few things that are independent of taking more risks, i.e., creating the verticals, right. So,
we were generalists 10 years ago and we hired marketing people and went to conferences and created marketing
material and special pricing that helped us compete in particular segments and verticals. And then we invested in
staff in the markets that we were – didn't have as much exposure in. And we also changed our compensation
practices 15, 20 years ago to pursue and help our teams pursue.
So, I think the biggest thing I would say, as we've been saying for some time, is we were underpenetrated and a
big part of our outsized growth was and continues to be being underpenetrated in the markets that we're in and
just getting our piece of the market share.
So we are not – we – in order to go from the growth rates we had 20, 15 years ago to the ones we're having now,
the only difference really is the things I mentioned. We haven't changed our credit underwriting. It's the same
team, as I said before. So, we're underwriting the same way. We've awakened our marketing capabilities and our
sales capabilities over the last decade to pursue what's rightfully ours from a market share perspective. We have
really low market share in all the markets that we're in. So, we've called that a runway for some time on these
calls. We have a really long runway to penetrate without taking any additional risks.
And on the CRE side, as we talked at great depth about how we do that, we're a recourse lender, we pay
attention to sponsors and global liquidity and things like that, so I feel very comfortable. And I would say – the
biggest thing I would say is, there really isn't anything different that we've been doing. I'm the same CEO I was 16
years ago when I took the job, and I've been overseeing credit over that entire 16 years. Tom Terry, who's our
Chief Credit Officer, is 34 years on the job; and Jim Rine is 26 years on the job, so – and that's just three of us.
But the – so that's what I'd say about it. Like I said in my prepared comments, I can't promise anything, but what I
can tell you is that we're very consistent.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities, Inc.
Understood. And just separately, if I could, Ram, in terms of the margin, I understand there's a lot of volatility, but
if the rate environment stays the way it is, what's your sense in terms of the cadence of margin compression from
this point on and do we see stabilization at a higher level relative to where we were when rates were zero back in
2015?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. As you said, Ebrahim, a lot of moving parts with margin looking ahead. One of the disclosures that we have
is the amount of PPP loans, for instance, we did. So, we've done up to this point $1.4 billion. And as you know,
those fees will get amortized over a 24-month period until a large portion of these loans will pay off or be forgiven
or just mature, right, at which point, all these [ph] fees (00:37:00) will be amortized. So, that can be a big impact to
our third and fourth quarter results in terms of how the margin progresses. But if you exclude PPP, one of the
things we've been really successful both on the asset side, and the liability side of the equation is instituting loan
floors in a majority of our new production and then as the [ph] back (00:37:19) book comes up for renewals, we've
11

UMB Financial Corp.
(UMBF) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2020 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2020
been able to be very successful in that as well. And you saw this quarter, we're also very prudent with our deposit
pricing. Our cost of deposits in March alone was 20 basis points lower than where 1Q deposits were. So, we're
taking a pretty good look at where deposit costs need to be.
So, we'll use up our excess liquidity that should be favorable to margin as well. And then, the other side is what's
happening with LIBOR. One month LIBOR was at 99 basis points or so at March 31 and it's now retreated down
to about 40 basis points and as you know, some of these are – some of our loans are indexed to one month
LIBOR. But as I said earlier, as these loans come up for renewals, we are pretty successful at flooring some of
these rates.
And then the last point I'll make is just to buy yields on our portfolio given where the 10-year is at, less than 60
basis points. That's [ph] slipped (00:38:14) a little bit. You see the roll-off yield on one of the pages, it's about [ph]
2.25% (00:38:18), we're getting slightly lower than that between a mix of mortgage-backed securities and muni
bonds. So, the final point I'll make is, net interest spread, as you saw this quarter, is going to be pretty stable. The
benefit of free funds and what happens to the value of our DDA balances which are 30-plus percent of our [ph]
book (00:38:36), it's – that's where we see the lower benefit going forward. [ph] Another (00:38:41) long answer to
say nothing, but I'm not – we don't give typical margin guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think – I think Ram mentioned there – in there that obviously a big part of our deposit repricing happened
in late March. So, a lot of that positive impact we'll see in the second quarter.

complete the ASR in the second quarter. So, how does the share count change from the end of March to June, I
guess?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
So, the way the ASR works is 85% of the $30 million through the ASR has already been retired or put in treasury
stock. So the 15%, the broker/dealer just holds back for any volatility in stock price. So the 15% could be another
100,000, 150,000 shares from where March 31 ended.

Well – yeah, I'll get that. So, based on the profile we've seen and what we disclosed, the average loan size is
about $122,000. And right now, we're trending closer to [ph] $250,000 on the (00:40:41) loan origination fee and
that's gross. Obviously, the other thing that we'll factor in is the funding cost. We could avail of the PPP lending
facility which funds this loans at 35 basis points. And then there's any costs, incremental and marginal costs that
are associated with the program, whether it's legal, regulatory, new system that we purchased to enable this to be

John Rodis Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Two other questions for me, guys. Just – I guess just one, your comment – your thoughts as far as the loan
pipeline going forward, obviously, the first quarter was very strong, but I would think things have slowed pretty
dramatically. And then, just one other question or just if you could address – the other question was on service
charges. You saw a bump-up related to healthcare and just your thoughts as far as that going forward, or is that
more sort of one-time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'll take the – this is Mariner. I'll take the first question and then I'm going to turn that second over to Jim
Rine. The first question about the pipeline, we have a pretty long history of giving you, our investors on these
calls, a look into the upcoming quarter and then that's about as much forward-looking as we are able and willing
to give. And so, the second quarter looks, based on the pipeline, to be as strong as the first quarter or
thereabouts. And so, it looks to be a solid second quarter. I have no idea what third and fourth quarter will be
given kind of the conditions and the inability to kind of get out and play golf and have lunch or a cup of coffee with
a prospective borrower. So, those – that, I imagine, in the third and fourth quarter, if things don't open up,
significantly would slow some. But the second quarter looks pretty good. And...

James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
So, on healthcare, you saw a spike in the service charges and that was related to one relationship that we still
have the deposits and the business that was transferring the actual custodial relationship on the accounts. The
deposit still are growing in our healthcare space. The pandemic, [ph] it (00:44:30) still remains to be seen as far
as how it will impact the industry in general, but the high deductible plans should become much more in favor as
employers look to continue to reduce costs going forward. So, we're – well, right now, we don't see the full impact
of how things will play out through the course of the year. We did see some of the card activity reduce also in
March, but we will know more in the next few months how the rest of the year plays out there.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Hey, David. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
The first question I have relates to the large commercial customer you talked about that cost an increase in your
non-accruals. Can you talk about maybe what industry that was or what changed with that relationship or if there's
anything else you can disclose that caused that move?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Sure. It's actually two relationships that caused that move. And I think, I'll just point you back for a moment just
kind of the way non-performings and criticized credits work at UMB. We have a long history of sort of seeing
some volatility on that. And the reason for that is the way we operate, which is we are very quick to take action
and recognize problems and work them. We have a pretty long great track record of doing so.
And what is – if you take a look at our long – the chart from criticize to doubtful or loss, you'll see that the
migration from non-performing or criticized to loss is de minimis. And so, again, I guess, what I would just point
you to is from time-to-time, you'll see two or three credits that end up in that non-performing category that cause a
spike to those numbers.
But typically, that's just because we're working – we're identifying them early and working them early for a
solution. And in this particular case, there's two credits, one in the energy space and one in the ag space. The
one in the ag space, we feel like we have adequate collateral coverage to bring us home. The one in the energy
space, we have already reserved for what we believe to be – today, believe to be the exposure on that one. And
so, I think you'll, over time, see our number come back down into its averages. So, that's the high level of what
has impacted that and how we're thinking about those two credits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thank you. And then, my second question relates to your trust and securities processing line. Is that more
driven by market values, transactions volumes or a mix there and then what type of trends have you seen in that
business?

Mariner Kemper A

definitely a part of it.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2020
Yeah. So, the fees in that business, it's two-fold. Some is market action, but we've had nice backlog in that
business. In our wealth management business, the new business from new customers has been up 50% over Q1,
2019 and the growth in AUM from new customers is up 79%. And the fund services business, we've had –
continue to convert new customers and we've seen strong growth on that. And so, we feel very good about where
we're positioned. But as far as the decline in the market, we were off. [ph] The market and equities were off
(00:49:03) roughly 35%. We were only off roughly 10% in portfolio values. So, weren't seeing the declines like the
– our declines didn't mirror the actual market and some of the fees are tied to the actual market returns. But
some, obviously, are more flat fee as well.
So, there's a mix there. But the business has continued to grow. We've invested in it. We have a new platform
being brought on for the private wealth management space this year that will allow us to hold additional
alternative investments on that platform and be a better experience for our clients. So, a lot going on in that
space, but we've continued to invest and we haven't cut back on the projects related to growing the business
regarding that space.

Well, maybe just a modeling question for you on the expenses. Understanding the offsets on the COLI that ran
through both fees and expenses. But if I adjust for that $16 million and then also the seasonal, I think you'd call
out $8 million of seasonal expenses, is that the right way to kind of think about where expenses could be near
term, understanding, you may pull back on some costs given restrictions on travel and marketing?

Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Generally, yeah, that's – the $8 million is seasonal expenses and you just heard Jim Rine talk about it. In
this environment, we haven't really scaled back any of the investments from that standpoint, right. We're
continuing our path on that one. So, you should see some inflation related to that. But at the same time, as we've
always said, we'll be really watchful of some of those discretionary items. The lockdown is creating some of those
synergy opportunities just from a travel and entertainment and marketing perspective. So, we'll watch our
expenses from that standpoint.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A

continue through this environment learn that we can continue to be more efficient in the way we're operating.

Okay.

Ram Shankar A

And then, of course, in the disclosures, we also have some of the expenses that we track related to the COVID
crisis. And in the first quarter, we had $250,000 or so or less of that. Some of the programs that Mariner talked
about, whether it's the supplemental pay or just in terms of our readiness and preparedness for COVID, you can
see some of that impact our expense line. But, again, it depends on how long this lasts. So, those will impact our
expense trajectory as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And just a couple of small ones. The disclosures were great in the deck. The reserve ratios, we're getting
some questions just for banks on specific of those portfolios that you deem somewhat higher risk. Do you have
the reserve that you have set aside on both the hotel and the energy portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A

The energy book, we have a qualitative reserve of about $13 million which is 3.5% of that book. The hotel, I don't
know if I know the answer, Chris, specifically...

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Understood.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, it's been my perception as I sort of look at all of the other announcements coming out that they've been sort
of standard account – it's been kind of a standard accounting exercise, a bit of a lazy exercise, if you will, to me.
Just sort of taking the whole book, saying, oh, okay, everybody's interested in hotels, so here's our hotel book,
boom, done. So, we took some extra effort to actually show you what we actually are worried about, because it
isn't – I don't think the right approach just to take the whole book and say it's at risk, because that's just not true.
So, that was really what we did was instead of just kind of doing a blanket simple accounting exercise and just
showing you what we had in each category, we broke it down to tell you what we worry about and then how we
think about where the real risk is and that's in those two columns to the right on page 26, where we talk about
reasons.
Reasons for excluding and then the farther column to the right, are just additional comments as to why we may or
may not worry about something that is even still on that list. So, just because it's on that list, doesn't mean we
think we're going to take a loss because hey, it's also got liquid sponsors on there or for example, doesn't come to
market within the next six months. So, something we can readdress later six months from now, depending on
where we are.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2020
It's tough because of all the volatility in earnings and the percentage of tax-free income [ph] as it (00:54:53)
related to pre-tax. So, my best guess, Chris, at this point would be closer to 14%.

Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Hey, Chris, I might add to, I think it might be interesting for everybody to know on oil and gas, because everyone
is concerned about that as we are. That remains about the same percent of the book as it was during the 2014
energy pricing crisis. And [ph] it's (00:55:24) generally the same clients that are in that book for us. 30% of it is
service which is really where most of the concern would be, the great majority [ph] the rest (00:55:35) has hedges
on it.
And on the service side, the customers that we ranked and worried about during the last cycle are the same
customers this cycle and the sponsors in those credits stepped up during the last cycle. So, we have great
confidence really in the ones that remain in that book because of the same people who stepped up behind the
credits during the last crisis.

Hey, Eb.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities, Inc.
Just a follow-up, maybe Mariner or Jim, and it might be a tough one to answer, but I was wondering if you've seen
any improvement in customer sentiment, activity through the course of the last month, means everything
obviously shut down in a big way in the middle of March, I'm just wondering [ph] if (00:56:37) things have kind of
steadied in the last few weeks. If there are any kind of green shoots or any pickup in activity that you've noticed
that might be worth calling out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
There – the one thing I would point you to is just line utilization. So, as the crisis started do unfold, we went from
39% to 41% in utilization. And if this is any indication of sentiment, that has dropped back down to 39% as we sit
here today. So, that is some indication maybe of how the customers feel. I would say just generally, anecdotally
as we speak to our clients and I'll let maybe Tom [ph] pipe in (00:57:18) here for a second, I think everyone is still
nervous and cautious. So, I don't see anybody really reacting as if they see light at the end of the tunnel right now,
it would be my take and I'll let Tom add to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Chief Lending Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
[ph] Look (00:57:35)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I think just it's – in general, there's a – in my opinion and I think our customers would share that with a – there's a
long row to hoe here and I don't think there's much of a sentiment change. You want to add to that, Tom?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Chief Lending Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
No. I think you said it just right. I think there's a wait and see attitude. And I think we have a very patient client
base and I think people are going to walk before they run certainly before they start borrowing and expanding too
quickly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I would just add, as I think you already know, just about how we lend. Our borrowers are, in general, on the
stronger end of things. They've got better balance sheets and liquidity and that's sort of how – what kind of lender
that we are. So, we have borrowers generally speaking that always operate [ph] as if (00:58:32) things can get
worse and that's the right way to think about things.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

[ph] All right (00:58:37). Thank you.

James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
And, Ebrahim, this is Jim Rine. We also have a lot of borrowers that are also essential businesses that are still
active, that are quite busy, that are also going through the motions of employing safe workspaces, while going
about construction contracts and things like that while they're busy. They're certainly experiencing the new
normal. They have an experience – they've experienced some delays in projects, but not outright cancellations
yet. So, it really is a mixed bag which isn't the exact answer you would be looking for. But I'm sure that's the
consistent answer that you're hearing from others.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I also think you – you didn't really ask it this way, but I'll offer it as it relates to just how this thing is unfolding. I
don't believe – so what we – there's a lot of conversation about when we go back and what that looks like. To me,
going back is going to be a very, very slow ride. You think – you hear what Texas is doing is they're calling it a
complete open, but at 25% capacity. So, I think until we have a vaccine, things are going to – when they do open
and we call things open broadly, it's going to look a lot more like Texas than it's going to look like what we left
behind in February. So, I think the road is long and hard even when we come out, because coming out doesn't
mean 80% capacity. It means 25%, 30% capacity. That's my personal opinion, until we have a vaccine.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, for the $448 million of in process modifications...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
...slide 13, I'm just [ph] wondering (01:01:09) if the industries those are in are similar to the existing modifications,
or if that's skewed to any particular industry?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
No. There's nothing. There's no skewing going on there. [ph] We're (01:01:21) just – yeah, I'd also just might add
that in my opinion on modifications and forbearance, in general, I don't know exactly how the investor population
is thinking about it. But it feels like it's something you all are looking for to see if – what existing problems might
exist. And the color I would give you is that really, at least, for UMB, modifications and forbearance really is
forward-looking and relief-based to help people avoid problems rather than a recognition of existing problems.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And just in terms of clients seeking modifications, has that also slowed similar to the
utilization rates, or that is still fairly similar [ph] to the quarter-end (01:02:06)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Tom, do you have any color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Chief Lending Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. It has slowed. We had quite a few right out of the gate. I think PPP maybe caught some people's attention.
You talk to some of the other chief credit officers in various meetings, there are some feeling that certainly the
longer this goes, if it goes past May or past June in terms of how long it takes for the economy to come back,
there may be another wave. We haven't seen that yet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. And, by the way, my comments a moment ago is to clear them up about the 25% or 30% come-back. That
would be – I was thinking more along those lines as service, not GDP, like the utilization of what restaurant
activity and concerts and such and things like that, not so much GDP. So, just a clarification.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2020
And then just one last one for me, maybe a big picture question as it relates to CECL methodology. Do you
actually need to see an improvement in the GDP and in unemployment rates, or is there enough qualitative
overlay where you can preemptively begin to lower reserve levels in advance of those metrics actually coming
down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
This is Ram. It's a little bit early to talk about it. But if you look at the Moody's forecast, and we have a little
synopsis of what the forecast entails, right, so it has unemployment rate peaking to an average of 8.7%, at least,
as of the March 27th forecast, and then coming down back to a 6% level. So that kind of recovery is already built
into how we modeled it, and we would call it maybe a bathtub U recovery as opposed to any kind of V recovery.
That's not what we're assuming in terms of unemployment getting back to normal, whatever the new normal
would be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
But – so to echo or one extra layer there on Ram's comments, if that were the case, that's the answer to your
question. But then the flipside is, obviously, if Moody's changes its forecast in the second quarter to match
something more like what JPMorgan is taking about with a 20% unemployment and a 40% reduction, if that type
of thing were to take hold into the Moody's forecast that we would have to react to that, and that's where then you
start assessing what you think the $9 trillion in stimulus has from a qualitative perspective. We start doing
qualitative overlays related to how unemployment specifically impacts different categories within our book and
how we feel about how national data plays into our book in the middle part of the country, and those types of
things that we would overlay.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2020
Mariner has answered my first question just on the oil and gas book in terms of how that portfolio has changed in
both size and client composition since the 2015/2016 downturn. But I guess I'm just curious if you guys have a
sense, or when you look back at that period, what [ph] ultimate loss content looks (01:05:24) like across that
portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
We had very little losses in it. It's actually – we've ranked the credits and worried about them, but ultimately had
very little in the way of losses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then just going back to the PPP loans that you guys had funded, any sense for that $1.4 billion,
$1.5 billion that you've funded, how much of that has actually been kind of geared towards those clients that you
guys outlined on that slide that have been more so impacted?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
We don't – I don't think we have an overlay to get into that with you to match those two up. So, I don't think we
have that level of detail. Tom?

Thomas S. Terry A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just a couple of housekeeping questions, Ram. The securities book came up a little bit in the
quarter. Obviously, you guys had good seasonal deposit growth as well. Just any sense of how that securities
portfolio is going to trend over the next few quarters, obviously, with the PPP loans [indiscernible] (01:06:53)
balance sheet and so forth and just how those – how you expect those to be [ph] up (01:06:58)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Chief Lending Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I would say – yeah...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Thomas S. Terry A
Chief Lending Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I would say consistent with current levels, obviously, every month, we're evaluating whether we want to reinvest in
this market. As I've said earlier, the roll-on/roll-off yields on the securities book, especially the mortgage-backed
securities book has [ph] flipped (01:07:16). So, we're going to be very cautious about reinvesting. And at the end
of the day, we might have excess liquidity because, at some point, we do anticipate and we're seeing the halo
effect of excess liquidity that we did see through the last crisis from a deposit standpoint. So, at some point, we'll
have excess liquidity that we might have to deploy between these and mortgage-backed securities that [ph] as we
(01:07:40) – as I look for the next quarter or two, I would keep it consistent with where it's been.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. We have definitely, as we did in the last crisis, seen some flight-to-safety deposit gathering activity for sure
and expect to continue to feel that. And, in particular, without naming any banks, but some of the missteps that
have taken place in the industry as it relates to how PPP rolled out, we have – we're seeing some benefit from
that as we were early and took action and started adding non-customers to that pipeline as they were not being
served in other places. So, I think we're going to continue to see some of that flight-to-safety, flight-to-quality
deposit building and deposit gathering activity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Makes sense. And if I could just ask one more, just within expenses and I know you guys don't give
guidance, but marketing was down pretty substantially, sequentially. And then during 2019, you guys obviously
had a ramp in legal and consulting fees. So just any sense for how those line items could trend this year. It
sounds like you guys have some delays in the timing of some projects and so forth. So, just trying to put in that
context in terms of the run rate of those items.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Go ahead, Ram.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, you can see that it's consistent with what the last first quarter was, so there's always a seasonal drop-
off in the first quarter. We did accelerate some of the spending for concepts in the fourth quarter. So that's why it's
a little bit higher than usual as well. But as I said earlier, that's one of the discretionary items that we will consider
as we look at our expenses.
Obviously, in a lockdown, some of the things that roll up into that line item are travel and entertainment and
sponsorships and things like that. So, to the extent those don't happen, you might see those trending lower. But
once you come out of the crisis, [indiscernible] (01:09:39) go back on the customer acquisition side and start to
market for both the consumer and card portfolios, specifically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
