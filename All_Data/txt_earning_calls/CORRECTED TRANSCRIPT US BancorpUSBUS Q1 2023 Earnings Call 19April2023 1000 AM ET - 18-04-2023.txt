MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Welcome to the U.S. Bancorp First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the
results, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and
available for replay beginning today at approximately 11:00 AM Central Time.
I will now turn the conference call over to George Andersen, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor
Relations for U.S. Bancorp.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
George Andersen
Director-Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp
Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, our Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. During their prepared
remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation as well as our
earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.
I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and
uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page
2 of today's presentation, in our press release, our Form 10-K, and in subsequent reports on file with the SEC.
Following their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will take any questions that you have.
I will now turn the call over to Andy.

Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on slide 3. In the first
quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.04, which includes $0.12 per share of charges related to the MUFG
Union Bank acquisition. Excluding those notable items, earnings per share was $1.16. We achieved record net
revenue of $7.2 billion for the quarter. Following our successful close of Union Bank acquisition in December of
2022, first quarter results reflected a full year's benefit of the acquired franchise, continued growth in earning
assets, net interest margin expansion and higher noninterest income, led by stronger commercial product and
mortgage banking fee revenues.
Slide 4 details our reported and adjusted income statement results as well as the end of period and average
balances and other performance metrics. On the right, you will see the credit quality remains strong but is starting
to normalize as expected. Our charge-off ratio of 30 basis points as adjusted is well below pre-COVID levels and
reflective of our disciplined risk management culture. The CET1 ratio, our binding regulatory constraint, was 8.5%
at the end of the quarter, and is consistent with our target capital ratio. We expect to exceed 9.0% later this year
as we accrete capital back quickly over the next few quarters and continue to focus on risk-weighted asset
optimization initiatives.
Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, our return on average asset was 1.15% and
our return on average common equity was 15.7%. Our return on tangible common equity was 24.3% on an
adjusted basis.

Slide 6 provides both the high-level timeline and general update on our planned conversion of Union Bank.
Integration efforts have been progressing well, and we remain on track for a successful main systems conversion
over the upcoming Memorial Day weekend. We anticipate a full transition of all accounts by the second half of the
year.
Turning to slide 7. The industry disruption early in March has reinforced the importance of maintaining a well-
diversified business with an appropriate risk profile. We maintain a resilient and diversified deposit base. Over half
of our deposits are insured, and 80% of the uninsured deposits are retail or operational in nature. Our diversified
funding sources, ample liquidity levels and strong credit quality, supported by disciplined underwriting standards
are all hallmarks of our approach to risk management.
I'll now turn the call over to Terry, who can provide more detail on the balance sheet strength and the first quarter
earnings results.

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Andy. Turning to slide 8. A key strength of the bank is our well-diversified deposit base, which remains a
stable source of low-cost funding. As a reminder, following the completion of our acquisition of Union Bank last
quarter, our end of period deposits totaled $525 billion, including approximately $80 billion of deposits from Union
Bank. As we discussed last quarter, $9 billion of Union Bank acquired deposits were transitory in nature, with $4
billion returned to MUFG in the fourth quarter and an additional $4.7 billion that moved back to MUFG in the first
quarter of this year. In addition, $1.1 billion of acquired deposits were included in the branch sale or related to [ph]
Peer Point (00:04:44), a broker deposit-gathering mechanism that we discontinued.
Importantly, prior to the events of March 8, we saw expected deposit outflow largely consistent with seasonal
patterns reflective of our business mix, including our large trust business. From March 8 through the end of the
quarter, deposit balances were relatively stable, down only 0.6%, as inflows from new customers were slightly
offset by the impact of clients diversifying their deposits and seeking yield in money market funds consistent with
broader industry trends. During this period, we saw an increase in money market funds of approximately $10
billion within our Wealth Management and Investment Services businesses.
We expect the competition for deposits to remain high for the industry in 2023. Our cumulative deposit beta
through the first quarter was approximately 34%, and we expect that to increase to about 40% by the end of this
rate cycle, generally in line with our previous expectations.
Slide 9 provides additional detail on the composition of our highly-diversified deposit base. As the slide shows, our
deposit balances are composed of a broad mix of consumer, corporate, and commercial customers that we
support with an expansive branch distribution network and mobile capabilities across our national footprint. Our
deposit base reflects the wide range of customers and industries that our companies serve.
At March 31, our percent of insured deposits to total deposits was 51%. Approximately 80% of our uninsured
deposits are composed of operational wholesale trust and retail deposits that are stickier, either because they are
contractually bound or tied to Treasury management services and trust activities provided to corporate and
institutional clients. Combined with our consumer base deposits, the stability of our funding source is sound.
Moving to slide 10, U.S. Bank's total available liquidity as of March 31 was $315 billion, representing 126% of our
uninsured deposits. As of March â€“ as of December 31, our liquidity coverage ratio was 122%. As mentioned, our
strong debt ratings reflect our diversified business profile, well-collateralized credit exposure, healthy capital and

liquidity profiles, and disciplined asset/liability management framework. These attributes work in concert with our
strong balance sheet optimization and management practices to ensure strength and stability of our balance
sheet.
Slide 11 provides details on the composition of our investment securities portfolio. Over the last five quarters and
well ahead of the most recent banking disruption, we reduced the size of our investment securities portfolio from
30% to 25% of total assets while increasing cash levels. In preparation for and as part of the completion of our
acquisition of Union Bank, we repositioned our balance sheet by selling fixed rate loans and investment
securities, paid off borrowings, and increased cash balances in response to economic uncertainty, industry
dynamics, rising interest rates, and increased market volatility.
At March 31, approximately 90% of the securities in our investment portfolio are backed and/or sponsored by the
US federal government, with 55% of securities designated as held-to-maturity and 45% designated as available-
for-sale. Further, available-for-sale unrealized losses as a percentage of our investment security portfolio
improved in the first quarter, and total AOCI improved by 11% on a linked quarter basis.
Turning to slide 12. As a reminder, following the completion of our acquisition of Union Bank, our CET1 capital
ratio declined from 9.7% at the end of the third quarter of 2022 to 8.4% as of December 31, which reflected the
impacts of balance sheet optimization and purchase accounting adjustments that will accrete back into capital
over the next few years. Strategically, we continue to be encouraged about the financial merits of this deal and
the synergistic benefits we expect to realize as a combined institution.
As Andy mentioned earlier, our CET1 capital ratio at March 31 was 8.5%. The 10 basis point increase from year
end reflected 20 basis points of capital accretion, offset by the transitional impact of CECL of 10 basis points. As
of March 31, we expect to accrete approximately 20 basis points to 25 basis points of capital per quarter as we
complete the Union Bank integration and realize cost synergies. Importantly, this does not include the impacts of
planned RWA optimization initiatives mentioned earlier.
Turning to slide 13. Total end of period loans were $388 billion, which was flat on a linked quarter basis and up
21.6% year-over-year. Commercial real estate loans represent approximately 14% of our total loan portfolio, with
CRE office exposure representing approximately 2% of total loans and only 1% of total commitments. Leveraged
lending balances are not a significant component of the loan portfolio.
Slide 14 shows credit quality trends, which continue to be strong but as expected are starting to normalize across
the portfolio. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.3% at March 31, compared
with 0.26% at December 31 and 0.25% a year ago. Our first quarter net charge-offs of 0.30% as adjusted
increased 7 basis points versus the fourth quarter level of 0.23% as adjusted and was higher when compared to
the first quarter of 2022, which was a level of 0.21%. Our allowance for credit losses as of March 31 totaled $7.5
billion or 1.94% of period end loans.
As the chart on the upper-right side of this slide demonstrates, our credit performance through the cycle serves as
a key differentiator for the bank.
Slide 15 provides a detailed earnings summary for the quarter. In the first quarter, we earned $1.16 per diluted
share, excluding $0.12 of notable items related to the recent acquisition of Union Bank.
Slide 16 highlights revenue trends for the quarter. Net revenue totaled $7.2 billion in the first quarter, which
included a full quarter of revenue contribution from Union Bank of $832 million, primarily representing net interest
5

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
income. Net interest income grew 7.9% on a linked quarter basis and 45.9% year-over-year driven by earning
asset growth and continued net interest margin expansion, which benefited from rising interest rates. Noninterest
income as adjusted increased 2.7% compared to the fourth quarter driven by higher commercial product revenue,
mortgage banking revenue, and trust and investment management fees partially offset by losses of $32 million
from securities sales.
Turning to slide 17. Adjusted noninterest expense for the company totaled $4.3 billion in the first quarter, including
$546 million from Union Bank. Noninterest expense as adjusted increased 9.1% on a linked quarter basis largely
driven by the impact of two additional months of Union Bank's operating expenses, core deposit intangible
amortization, and higher compensation and other noninterest expenses.
I will now provide second quarter and updated full year 2023 forward-looking guidance on slide 18. Starting with
the second quarter of 2013 (sic) [2023] (00:13:23) guidance, we expect average earning assets of between $600
billion and $605 billion in the second quarter and a net interest margin of approximately 3%. Total revenue as
adjusted is estimated to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, including approximately $85 million of
purchase accounting accretion. Total noninterest expense as adjusted is expected to be in the range of $4.3
billion to $4.4 billion, inclusive of approximately $120 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to
Union Bank.
Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% on a taxable equivalent basis. To-date, we have incurred $573
million in merger and integration costs and anticipated charges of between â€“ and anticipate charges of between
$250 million and $300 million for the second quarter. We continue to estimate total merger and integration costs
of approximately $1.4 billion, consistent with earlier guidance.
I will now provide updated guidance for the full year. For 2023, average earning assets are now expected to be in
the range of $600 billion to $610 billion. We expect the net interest margin to be between 3.0% to 3.05% for the
full year. Total revenue as adjusted is now expected to be in the range of $28.5 billion to $30.5 billion, inclusive of
approximately $350 million of full year purchase accounting accretion.
Total noninterest expense as adjusted for the year is expected to be in the range of $17.0 billion to $17.5 billion,
inclusive of approximately $500 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to Union Bank. Our
estimated full year income tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis is now expected to be approximately 23.0%. We
continue to expect to have $900 million to $1 billion of merger and integration charges in 2023.
I will now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.

Thanks, Terry. Events of the past few weeks have certainly raised questions about the overall health of the
banking industry and the economic outlook. The business of banking involves taking balanced risks, and these
risks must be carefully managed, appropriately regulated, and prudently mitigated. At U.S. Bank, we are focused
on the strength and stability of our balance sheet. Our investment in risk management practices is guided by our
core principle that includes always doing the right thing for the many stakeholders, communities, and constituents
we serve.
A key strength of our institution is our high-quality and diversified business mix and deposit base. The
combination of a mix of consumer, corporate, and commercial customers with significant operational deposits,
broad geographic reach, and a full breadth and depth of product and service offerings serves as a key

differentiator for the bank. Our high debt ratings, resilient liquidity profile, available funding sources, and strong
earnings capacity enable us to deliver industry-leading regulatory stress test results and contribute to our
resiliency during times of uncertainty.
As we continue to work to ensure a successful conversion of Union Bank next month, we are already seeing the
benefits of increased scale and market share as we bring our enhanced digital capabilities and broad and diverse
product set to the Union Bank customer base.
Our reputation as a prudent risk manager has been earned through our performance over many cycles, and we
have never been more focused on the strength and stability of our balance sheet.
Let me close by thanking our employees for all that they do on a daily basis for our customers, communities, and
shareholders. We have shown incredible strength and stability during these challenging times, and I am more
confident than ever in our ability to continue to deliver exceptional client service and superior product offerings in
a rapidly changing environment.
We'll now open the call for Q&A.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Yeah, our expectation is that if you end up just looking at the industry, there's going to be pressure on deposits
and high competition. We think we'll fare quite well with respect to that. To the extent that we see changes in
deposits, it will be kind of based upon that competition. So â€“ but I would say relatively stable.
And then coming to your second question, the mix of NIBs as an example in roughly fourth quarter [ph] was 25%
(00:18:41), 26% in that ballpark. It's 25%, and we think it's kind of hitting that kind of stable level keeping in mind
that we have a lot of operational deposits tied to our â€“ both our corporate and our corporate trust businesses, and
that kind of helps to sustain it. So it's a combination of things, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, I was hoping we could talk for a second about just the categorization and
when you guys would expect to be a Category II bank. I think there's a lot of chatter going on, especially in light of
that report from a couple of days ago. So maybe just in sort of clear terms, when would you expect to be a
Category II bank? Will that be due to your asset size, or thanks to the Fed's flexibility to designate you as one,
and then, how would you guys get there by that time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, our trajectory with respect to Category II is no earlier than the end of 2024, and that will be â€“ I think that'll
be more driven by whether the Fed makes that decision or not rather than asset size. Again, as we kind of
manage the company, we're going to be continued to be very focused on profitable loan growth and things like
that, so we get there when we get there, but that â€“ our expectation right now is no sooner than end of 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. And you guys feel like you're prepared to get there by that time, basically?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, it'll be a combination of a couple of things. We talked about the â€“ just the capital generation from earnings,
and of course, that is helped by the Union Bank transaction, and then, we're very focused on capital
management. We have to be just because of the Category II, and we'll be very focused on risk-weighted asset
optimization and making sure that we're focused on profitable growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I guess the question for USB is, I don't think your investors doubt the through the cycle credit outperformance or
even the PPNR strength. It's well-noted that the adjustment to your revenue outlook was very minimal relative to
peers. I think the big question that investors have is, you're starting from 8.5% CET1. You note earnings power
and capital organic â€“ capital generation of 20 basis points to 25 basis points, but as we anticipate Cat II and
you're telling us that the Fed could decide and not your asset size necessarily could decide when that line is, what
is the new endpoint of â€“ at CET1 in your view? Because as we think about going into that new category, I don't
think investors think that 8.5% to 9% is the right bogey. And then the sort of the sub-question to that, Andy, is, is
your priority getting to a higher capital level faster, and if so, how are you thinking about dividend growth this
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So, Erika, good question, and so I'm just going to go from the beginning. I think that would be helpful. So as you
know, we were well above 9% and came down to 8.4% as a result of the Union Bank transaction. The Union Bank
transaction is a terrific transaction. We're exceeding our revenue expectations. We are coming under on our
expense expectations. The accretion is greater than we expected, so the value to the franchise is positive, for
sure.
As we think about the Category II, I have three or four factors I think about. Number one is the earnings accretion
that we talked about, which is strong and growing, and will become even more accretive as we get through the
cost take-out component of the Union Bank integration.
Number two is, we have a number of initiatives across the board for risk-weighted asset optimization. Those are
things like credit transfers, risk transfers, a number of things to optimize the balance sheet that I think we ought to
be focused on and are very focused on, to your question.
And I think with those two things, as I mentioned, we expect to exceed 9% by the end of this year. That coupled
with our AOC (sic) [AOCI] (00:23:00) burn-down and additional accretion as we go into 2024 makes me
comfortable that we'll â€“ we are prepared with whatever event occurs as it relates to Category II in the timing, as
Terry mentioned, no later â€“ no earlier than the end of 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, a couple of things that I would maybe add because that's right on. Coming back to AOCI, that burn will be
kind of a function of a lot of different things. We have been very proactive in terms of repositioning the AFS
portfolio, looking at assets sales and securitization or asset sales, security sales, et cetera.
9


U.S. Bancorp

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
To kind of give you some sense, the duration of that investment portfolio, the AFS portfolio has gone from a little
over 4.5% in the fourth quarter to about 3.8% in at the end of the first quarter, so we're going to continue to
shorten the duration and that's going to help us with respect to managing AOCI. And then, in addition to that, we
have been essentially reducing the volatility of AOCI to up interest rate environment through hedging activities. So
it's a combination of a variety of things that we're going to go through.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

And is 9.5%, 10% an appropriate new bogey as we think about the shift change for next year on Cat II?

Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, the regulators are going through an analysis and process right now to think about how capital levels ought
to be in the industry across the board with Basel IV endgame and whatever changes to categorization occurs, so
we are waiting for that as you are to understand what the new environment will look like. But the plan that we
have in place is assuming what you â€“ what Terry just discussed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And just if I could sneak one last one in. One of your peers closest to you in size said that TLAC was pretty much
done invested. I noticed that you mentioned your superior debt rating several times. Clearly, the debt markets are
still a little bit dislocated, but how should we think about the wholesale funding stack from here? I noticed on a
period end basis, short-term borrowings went up by $25 billion. Terry, as you potentially anticipate a TLAC, how
should we think about your senior debt issuance plans, or will you sort of hold that level of borrowings until there's
a little bit more less dislocation in the senior debt market?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, again, TLAC is one of those things that we're going to learn more as we kind of go over the course of the
next 12 months. I think the real question is not whether or not TLAC will exist, because I do believe and we're
expecting that it will be something that gets put into place, but how does that get calibrated for the regional banks
reflecting the risk profile that we have relative to the GSIBs?
And there's a wide range of estimates that are out there. I, when we end up looking at that, I mean, maybe one
reasonable estimate would be based upon the foreign bank operators and kind of levels of TLAC. If that is the
case for us, I think it would be very manageable. It would be within a range that we would be able to manage to
and then that just gives us flexibility with respect to how we utilize that within the bank.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Well, your PE, if you believe consensus, is close to 7, and the market's around 20, so your relative PE is one of
the lowest in history. So I would posit that the market's concerned about something other than earnings.
So going back â€“ I guess the simple question for you, Andy, is, will U.S. Bancorp need to issue capital, and how
confident are you about that? And on the other side, are buybacks potentially an option once you get to 9%
CET1? And the reason I bring that up is you've seen the front page articles in papers, if you're forced to recognize
the unrealized securities losses, if you do a burn-down, and then people come up with all sorts of numbers, and
would you be forced to realize that? You heard Congress talk about these issues. Could you be forced to
incorporate that as part of the current stress test? Could the Fed force your hand sooner? Any color you can give.
What's your confidence that you might need to issue capital over the next year or so?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Mike. So as I said, I'm â€“ that is not part of our thinking as we sit today. I'm confident that our earnings
accretion, our RWA optimization, our AOC (sic) [AOCI] (00:28:08) burn-down will all get us to a point that we will
be at the appropriate capital levels and I can assure you that is a high-focus area for myself and the entire
management team, including Terry. So that is something we're very focused on.
Now, as it relates to buybacks, I will tell you, as we all know, there's a lot of capital changes that are likely to occur
from a regulatory standpoint, so we're not going to do anything until we have more clarity around that, which we
11

hope to have in the second half of the year. But the focus on getting to the appropriate capital levels as quickly as
possible, accreting capital and building that capital base is priority one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
And, Mike, the thing that I would add to that, we're going to learn with respect to exactly how moving to Category
II and the inclusion in unrealized losses gets incorporated into the CCAR process. Just as a reminder, we have a
pretty significant amount of buffer that already exists just based upon our credit performance and our PPNR
performance because of the earnings capacity. We continue to reduce the volatility of AOCI to rising interest
rates. We're doing that through pay-fixed hedges and just shortening the duration and things that I talked about
earlier.
I think there's very likely that they will incorporate a higher rate environment into the CCAR process. I will tell you
that we've done lots of scenarios that look at a stagflation sort of environment, and we actually perform better in
that environment because the revenue streams tend to hold up given our mix of business, et cetera. So we're
taking a lot of that into consideration, and like Andy said, we feel pretty confident that we don't have to go through
a capital raise.

And the â€“ as far as this year's stress test, would they include the underlying securities losses since that would
incorporate the nine-quarter time horizon, or no?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
No, that is not required in this CCAR analysis as a condition of the â€“ the way the deal was structured.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then last short one. Your noninterest-bearing deposits, I know you brought that up before, it certainly went
down more than average this quarter, but you're not guiding your margin down too much. It's at 3% to 3.05%
versus I guess 3.1% this quarter. Why wouldn't you be guiding that down even further given the decline in
noninterest-bearing deposits quarter-over-quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, it's a couple of different things. One is, again, if you end up just looking at the mix of total deposits, we
again think that total deposits will be relatively stable and that the mix of NIB will be relatively stable around that
25%, up or down. Part of the decline this particular quarter ties back to some of the seasonal flows, which are a
part of our trust business, but also the deposits that we knew were going to go out the door to MUFG because of
closing down the [ph] Peer Point (00:31:11), et cetera. All of those things kind of tie into the reason why we saw
the decline this quarter.

Hey, John.

Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Hi, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Yes. Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask on the idea of getting above 9% by the end of the year on CET1.
Does that rely on the RWA mitigation opportunities, or is that just kind of the 20 basis points to 25 basis points
that Terry mentioned before the RWA benefit? Is that something that will help you next year? Can you talk a little
bit about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, we think that the capital generation, the accretion that we'll see of the 20 basis points to 25 basis points is
core earnings capability, so it does not rely on those RWAs. So the RWA optimization that we will go through will
be above and beyond that. It's a part of that overall capital strategy that Andy talked about earlier.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
The benefits of that should happen and help you towards the end of this year, maybe into next year as you work
towards the end of 2024 capital target?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, it'll help us both this year as well as into next year, absolutely.

Terrance R. Dolan A

As you know, John, we've been kind of preparing for Cat II for well over a year. We put a lot of things in place in
the third and fourth quarter. We took some actions in the fourth quarter and we'll utilize a lot of those tools, if you
will, as part of the RWA optimization process that we're going to go through.

John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Yes. And just to clarify, Terry, this hasn't happened prior to the end of 2024 even with the Fed, right? The Fed
would tell you on January 2024 that it would take effect by the end of 2024, right? So it's not like they're going to
[indiscernible] (00:33:04), correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A

That is correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. And then, any idea of the pace of AOCI burn-down? Obviously, the AOCI came down 11% this quarter with
the help of rates, but in a world where rates aren't coming down, what's the natural kind of burn-off pace that you
might expect for that over a year or two? Any help on that, and just kind of reminding us of the duration again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, well, again, the duration of the AFS portfolio right now is about 3.8 years, so just if you kind of take that into
consideration, the burn-down will still be fairly reasonable even without interest rates. And again, we've put some
hedges into place in order to dampen the effect of rising interest rates with respect to AOCI.

John McDonald Q

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
On the â€“ back to the RWA optimization, can you maybe give us a little more color on what you're looking at there?
I know you mentioned credit transfers and risk transfers, but maybe if you can kind of flesh that out a little bit and
maybe give us an idea of the magnitude of the benefit that you see potentially materializing as a result of the
RWA actions. And then lastly, is other business or portfolio sales or divestitures considered within that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
The second part of the question was?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Are other business sales considered?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Oh, business sales. Yeah, at least, at this particular point in time, obviously we'll look at a lot of different things in
terms of businesses that we may look at to sell. I mean, that portfolio optimization is something we're always
doing, and we've done that a number of different times over the last several years. So that obviously will be
something we'll look at.
But we have a sizeable mortgage servicing rights portfolio. We'll take a look at selling portions of that where that
makes sense. We'll look at asset securitization like we did in the fourth quarter. There are a whole variety of risk
transfer sort of structures that both we have put into place and we already have on the shelf and we're ready to
kind of start moving forward on when we can. So I think it's a whole variety of different things that we will take a
look at as well as balancing the mix toward growth in what I would say less capital-intensive businesses as
opposed to capital-intensive businesses. So it's a â€“ it'll be a whole combination of things as we move forward,
John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
And do you have a way to help us estimate the magnitude in terms of how you're thinking about that targeted
contribution from the RWA optimization strategies?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So the strategies that we have in place are reflected in the guidance that we provided, so that would not change
that, and we will continue to update that guidance with given the economic conditions and rates and the scenarios
that we see. But as Terry mentioned, this is a priority for us and we have a number of initiatives underway, which
is the appropriate thing to do because I think capital for all banks is going to be more precious as we think about
the forward regulatory environment.

Got it. And then just one more for me. And I know you mentioned in terms of other regulatory changes potentially
coming down the pike, you're already in the advanced phase of proposed rulemaking on the TLAC thing. Could
you just talk about the other potential regulatory changes you see coming down the pike? I know you had
mentioned the AOCI efforts, but can you talk about potentially around FDIC or stress capital buffer liquidity rules,
anything on that front worth commenting on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, I mean, it could be a number of different things. I mean, we talked about TLAC, I mean, just levels of
capital. You hear them talking about domestically significantly important banks, so increasing the level of the
stress capital buffer is another piece of it. I think another one will be around LCR, and then in the CCAR process, I
think that they'll incorporate I would say multiple, but kind of go back to what they used to do. They'll have kind of
multiple scenarios, but one will be kind of what I would say a traditional sort of stress test where unemployment
goes up and rates come down. Another one will be more, I think, some form of stagflation where rates stay
relatively high and you experience the credit loss stress. And again, we've run a variety of different scenarios and
I think we feel like we would be able to withstand either one of those just based upon our risk profile.

Good morning, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning, Terry. Good morning, Andy. I have a narrower question. I think it was on slide 8, you guys talked
about the impacts of deposits following March 8. The inflows that you referenced, did that come primarily in the
Union Bank franchise? Because, obviously, it was located in California. I know you guys haven't been in California
as well. And then second, was it more commercial versus consumer and more interest-bearing versus
noninterest-bearing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, maybe in terms of the mix, so right after March 8, we actually saw a lot of account customer opening more
so on the commercial corporate side. I would say probably 70% on that side as opposed to on the consumer side
of the equation. We saw inflows but, again, that ended up getting offset by kind of seasonal flows within corporate
trust as the rest of the month kind of progressed.

U.S. Bancorp

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
The other thing that I would say is that, when I look at deposit net new customer accounts in specifically in
California on the consumer side, we actually saw a nice increase or pop in March relative to previous months, so I
think that we're actually probably seeing some benefits associated with that. And I think that addresses the
questions that you had.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. And then over the years, you guys have always done quite well in underwriting your loan portfolio.
You show up well in the CCAR tests over the years on credit, and so you don't have a very big exposure to
commercial real estate, and I always find it interesting to talk to banks that don't have big exposures to a potential
credit area that could be a problem. What are you guys seeing in that commercial real estate area, particularly in
the office portfolio? Any color would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure, Gerard. So first of all, the rest of the portfolio is very stable. If you look at our charge-off rates on non-
accruals and so forth and the numbers around credit metrics, the rest of the portfolio is stable and starting to
normalize but normalizing as we expected.
I do think the area of focus for all of us is office within real estate. And I do think there's some activity occurring
there with tenants' behavior changes, sponsor behavior changes that is going to cause some pressure in the
industry because of maybe an acceleration of what we thought was going to be a little longer process occurring
more rapidly. So you can imagine that we're very focused on it as well. We have not put on a lot of CRE office
over the last many years. We've been very, very conservative around that. So as you say, we don't have a large
exposure, but I do think it's an area of a lot of emphasis and focus because I do think there are going to be
pressures occurring.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I had a follow-up question. I think you briefly mentioned about I think AOCI hedges against if rates spike. I was
wondering, Terry, if you can elaborate on that. We've seen the five-year come back again in the last few weeks.
Just what's the downside risk to capital or just an increase in AOCI if rates spiked another 50 basis points, and
just talk to us in terms of the extent to which you expect to hedge against that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, so, again, we've been taking a number of different actions in order to kind of dampen the effect. As I said,
selling securities where appropriate, shortening the duration, which we did very nicely I guess in the first quarter,
and then putting in place pay-fixed swaps against the long end of the curve, so dampening the effect of a
movement up of rates in both, for example, in the 5 and 10-year sort of space. We â€“ if rates moved up 50 basis
points, obviously AOCI would be impacted to some extent, but we've dampened that quite a bit over the course of
the last couple of quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. And just going back to deposit betas, I think you talked about 40% relative to 34% this quarter. I
mean, I'm sure you do â€“ you'll do a ton of analysis on where [ph] terminal (00:42:53) betas might end up, but
what's the downside risk? We obviously had a shock to the system, Fed funds being 5% plus. What's the risk,
how do you handicap the risk of that 40% beta actually turning out to be something much higher, maybe closer to
50%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, we've done a lot of different analysis, and, I mean, you are right, the competition for deposits is getting
stronger. We've kind of taken into that consideration. We're seeing over 5% in some markets. Generally, it is
smaller banks where that is occurring, community markets, those sorts of things. And that's because for those
entities that's their primary source of funding, and so that's going to occur, but all of that has been kind of taken
into consideration in terms of looking at that 40% deposit beta.
If you end up looking at our business again in terms of who we end up competing against, et cetera, but what we
end up looking at and tracking is especially on the institutional corporate side of the equation is money market
rates and those sorts of â€“ and those sorts of things. Right now, that's kind of in the high-4s and our deposit pricing
is very competitive with that, which is why it gives us confidence with respect to both flows and the deposit betas
that we've articulated.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And you don't see a major shift in consumer and retail deposit pricing today versus maybe at the start of
the year?

Yeah, it's going to depend. I mean, obviously, this depends upon the rate environment. I mean, if the Fed, for
example, goes up another 50 basis points or 100 basis points from here, that would put more pressure on deposit
betas. But if you end up looking at the market implied or even up a bit, I still feel pretty comfortable with where
we're at.

It's Deutsche Bank. You've got very strong reserves to loans on a stated basis. I guess, first, can you remind us
what the impact there is if you adjusted for the Union Bank loans that were marked at fair value when you took
them on, if you have that handy?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Andrew J. Cecere A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Sorry about that. I was just asking about the outlook for the loan loss reserves from here in your base case.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, so our expectation is that, again, Andy's talked about the fact that we're preparing for any economic sort of
outcome that might exist. I think if you end up looking at the consensus in the marketplace, some form of
recession probably a softer or moderate sort of recession late this year or early next year, and if you look at the
market implieds, that would kind of tie into that.
When we go through our reserving process, we look at multiple scenarios. We weight to the conservative side.
We look at five different scenarios. We make assumptions with respect to that. Only 35% of it's weighted toward
what I would call the base case and the rest of it is downside. So we feel pretty good about where rate reserve
levels are. Obviously, if we saw an economic shock above and beyond kind of what is being expected, that might
be a little bit different, but â€“ and we feel pretty good about how we're thinking about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then maybe if I could just squeeze in on spending trends throughout 1Q regards to your

maybe any comments so far in April. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, in our payments business, we continuing to see pretty strong sales, 10-plus-percent, for example, in our
payments merchant processing business, a very strong mid- to high-single digits with respect to our corporate
payments business. If you end up comparing any of these things to pre-pandemic, it's through the roof. So we
continue to see a good spend in the business.

I would say that after the market disruption, there was a bit more softness in retail sales, which we're going to
continue to watch. It's really too early to tell whether or not that's a trend or whether that was really some of the
concerns around the market disruption, but we'll continue to watch that.
Andy, what would you add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, and that is still growing, Matt, but it's just growing at a lower rate particularly in retail. Airline spend
continues to be very, very high, which is a little bit of a reason that we have a differential between a sales growth
and revenue growth because the airline spread is a little thinner. So travel continues to be strong, retail came
down a bit, but still growing.

Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You've given us a lot of good detail on the AFS side. I just wonder
if you could discuss a little bit how you anticipate managing the held-to-maturity portfolio. Do you also plan to let
that kind of burn down and shorten? And I'm curious just given that, that's a lot of mortgage-backed and as there
are principal payments each month, how quickly does that portfolio burn down or do you see the need to maintain
a lot of duration there just in case we get another decline in rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, I mean, obviously, we look at both sides of the equation. The burn-down on the HTM side is simply
because of the nature of it. It is really more tied to how quickly you see payouts and what the duration of that ends
up looking at. I think as we look at the size of the investment portfolio, et cetera, we'll take into consideration what
level of duration we want to have in that â€“ in the HTM portfolio. But that's going to be more a function of just
paydowns and payoffs over time.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. First question, I just wanted to ask you on credit. On an adjusted basis, your charge-
offs were 30 basis points this quarter. And per the comments you made earlier about CRE and some of the data
we see in the release about delinquencies and NPAs increasing, what's your just â€“ what's your outlook for
charge-offs as we go forward versus the 40 basis points that we saw in the first?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, I mean, our expectation is that 30 basis will continue to normalize throughout the year and into 2024,
probably on a similar sort of pace I think is 23 basis points in the fourth quarter, so I think that that will continue to
kind of move up as the year progresses. Just a part of normalization.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Understood on that. Okay. And then just coming back to the full year guide, obviously, you made a modest
adjustment which was well expected given the change in the rate outlook. We can back into that, I think it's mostly
on the NII side, just given that that's where seemingly some of the changes were versus the prior outlook. But can
you just kind of refresh us and just give us kind of just some underlying thoughts of NII growth versus fee growth
and any changes you had on, if any, on the fee side versus your prior outlook? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
To your point, most of the changes were in NII, and it's a function of the â€“ of rate curve, the rate environment, the
expectation about rate increases as well as the deposit pricing that Terry made reference to in the beta,
approaching 40%, so most of the change was in NII.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then so just last follow-up, so then embedded in your fee outlook for the year, it was pretty decent
growth it would seem then, and are you expecting that to still be mostly driven by the payments business or are
there other areas that you're expecting to see some good growth in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
We have a great diversity of revenue sources, and they're all doing well. So payments is up â€“ approaching
double-digits, 9% on a year-over-year basis. As Terry talked about, spend levels are good. We had a bang of a
quarter in our commercial products group across the categories and that is doing just terrifically in this
environment and just driving revenue growth as well. Trust is doing well, so â€“ and mortgage. So that's the value of
a diverse revenue stream. There are many different sources of revenue and fee income.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, Andy. Hi, Terry. A couple â€“ just a clarifications. I think you all mentioned that accretion from the deal, Andy, is
going better than you had expected. Any â€“ I know you've talked a lot, just trying to pull this all together. Where are
you seeing it better thus far?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, so, and we talked about this, Vivek, in the fourth quarter that the expectation of that 8% going to 11% and
the returns actually better. So if I look at it in the big picture, when we initially thought about the deal, Union Bank
had a $2.9 billion or so revenue base and a $2.6 or so billion â€“ $2.3 billion expense base, so [ph] $600 million
(00:54:04) PPNR and you look at the first quarter and it's double that. So the revenues are stronger principally
because of the value of deposits in this rate environment. The expenses are a little less, and our expectations on
our efficiencies are continuing to be on plan. So all that adds up to a higher accretion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
And that higher accretion is â€“ the net purchase accounting is actually negative given the...

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A

Vivek Juneja Q

Right. And that's before you even finish the integration that you've â€“ I mean, that's not till second quarter anyway.

Operator: Next, we can go to Erika Najarian with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah, sorry to prolong the call. I just had one follow-up question. Andy, I asked the question in a compound way,
so I apologize, but as you think about accreting to over 9% CET1 by year end, how would you stack rank dividend
growth as a priority?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Dividend growth continues to be a priority, Erika, so our expectation is we would have continued growth in the
dividend. The dividend growth number is not hugely material to the capital accretion math. If you go through the
numbers on that, that is a relatively small component of a negative downturn in capital. So I â€“ that expectation
that I talked about includes the expectation of a strong dividend.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thank you.

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Hey, last quarter you mentioned your reserves were for an environment with 6% unemployment. I was
wondering if you had an update for that? And given CECL accounting, does that mean your reserving is done
before the recession has even started, or how do you think about that, and what about the release of reserves to
the extent you stay down in the low charge-off range even with some of the normalization?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Yeah, well, I think we'll wait and see what ends up happening given the uncertainty that's in the economy
regarding the last bit of it, but, yeah, no, we had said that it was the weighted average at the peak was on â€“ peak
quarter was about a little over 6%. It's about 5.9%, today is kind of what our weighted average case kind of comes
up to, so very similar to what we had before.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And your outlook for the economy, soft recession, hard landing, kind of what's your thinking?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So, Mike, we expect a soft recession, a moderate recession in the later half of this year, but as Terry mentioned,
our CECL accounting is assuming a sort of a two-thirds downturn, one-third base case, so we are reserved to a
little bit more downward scenario.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
