Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you. Magda and good morning, everyone. Before diving into the numbers, let me share a few thoughts and
how our business has been performing as we've adapted to a new normal during the second quarter. Volumes
and volatility normalized somewhat across our businesses from the extreme first quarter disruption and
conversations with clients have shifted from dealing with a crisis to how we can help support their business in this
new environment, but much uncertainty remains over the timing and shape of the global economic recovery.
In addition, the low interest rate policy is a significant headwind for us that is unlikely to change in the near term.
Operationally, we continue to navigate the repercussions of the pandemic around 95% of our employees continue
to work remotely, doing a phenomenal job delivering excellent service to our clients. Our operating platforms and
infrastructures are supporting the current market working model well with record volumes in certain areas, all
which has put us in a good position as we discuss new business opportunities with our clients.
Turning to our second quarter financial results. We reported solid pre-tax income of $1.2 billion and earnings per
share of $1.01. As a reminder, we did not buy back shares in the second quarter in line with other big banks.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
We accreted capital and ended the quarter with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.6%, up around 120 basis
points from the last quarter. Our average balance sheet increased year-over-year to $415 billion, mainly driven by
strong deposit inflows and associated growth and the securities portfolio. Revenue was up 2%, despite the impact
of lower interest rates and related money market fee waivers. All of our investment service businesses showed
resilient performance.
Asset servicing in particular is showing nice pockets of growth, and our focus on service quality is paying off. The
challenges that asset managers are dealing with are driving more of them to outsource and our unique
capabilities and fund accounting and transfer agencies as well as investments we've made in building out our
digital and data capabilities positions as well.
Last month, more than 800 attendees representing over 160 client firms and 25 consulting firms and vendors that
we work closely with participated in our Virtual ENGAGE20 event. ENGAGE which has long been the premier
data and technology conference for buy-side investment managers, highlights next-generation cloud-first
business applications.
During the event, we announced the launch of our new data and analytics offerings and expanded relationship
with Microsoft to provide these solutions on the Microsoft Azure public cloud. We are pleased to have clients such
as Charles Schwab and Nuveen share case studies on how their businesses will benefit from our newest
offerings.
Those include a new cloud-based data vault that supports the rapid onboarding of data, whether public markets
data, private proprietary or unstructured data to offer greater flexibility and accelerate client innovation and
discovery. We also released our new ESG application, which supports the creation of investment portfolios
customized to individuals, clients, environmental, social and governance preferences and provide crowd-sourced
guidance around the preferred ESG factors and priorities, and our distribution analytics application, which builds
upon our intermediary analytic service, leveraging data from broker dealers and RIAs to predict drivers of demand
for mutual funds and ETFs, so they can identify how to successfully gain market share.
And across all our businesses, there are opportunities to capture greater market share, within products, services,
target clients segments, and markets. Much of this is the outcome of consistently investing in technology and
talent.
There's been an acceleration this year and the adoption of digital solutions by our clients who continue to review
opportunities to automate. The progress we're making and digitizing our business positions us well on this front
and we're increasing our investment spend on technology driven automation initiatives in 2020.
In March through June alone, we migrated over 100 clients to digital solutions and are accelerating our plans to
do the same across all of our asset servicing clients. We are now accepting digital signatures on many tax related
forms to support remote processing, digitizing these processes will help thousands of clients and reduce the
millions of physical documents we deal with each year.
We also developed a new API-enabled FX solution jointly with Deutsche Bank, that can dramatically improve
conformation times for restricted emerging market currency trades, to provide front office users with faster
execution and enhanced workflow transparency. So we've accelerated our progress on the digital front, and there
are dozens of other examples.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
I'm proud that we've been working with the regulators and the industry to bring our capabilities and supporting the
markets. Since last quarter, we've been administering the primary dealer credit facility which facilitates dealers'
inventory financing. Our corporate trust business has also been mandated as the term asset-backed securities
loan facility administrator and then we're also servicing TALF funds and asset servicing.
Additionally, we're playing an important role in the Fed supportive liquidity in the municipal markets via the
municipal liquidity facility. This one's a demonstration of the power of our uniquely broad range of solutions. We're
able to bring together the expertise from asset servicing, corporate trust, investment management and capital
markets to create a complex solution to support the facility.
Looking ahead to the second half of 2020, we're confident that our business model, expense control and
conservative credit risk profile will serve us well. Our efforts with clients are yielding results with higher win ratios,
better revenue retention and a good pipeline in Pershing an Asset Servicing in particular. We are pleased with the
momentum we are seeing across all of our businesses.
The low interest rate environment will present a significant challenge both through net interest revenue and
money market fee waivers in Pershing and Investment Management and to a lesser extent other investment
services businesses. But at the same time, we will benefit from increases in transaction volumes, FX volatility,
stronger market levels and activity in our clearance and collateral management business.
The recent DFAST and CCAR results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business model. We had the
lowest peak to trough reduction in CET1 capital under the Fed's model relative to other US-based G-SIBs at just
20 basis points. Now that's well below the minimum SCB requirement.
Looking ahead at our capital returns, we expect to maintain our quarterly common stock dividend at $0.31 and we
will not buy back shares during the third quarter. We have a very strong capital position and low risk model that
should allow us to reform well under a wide range of scenarios. We will commence buybacks as soon as possible,
depending on the economic and regulatory environment. Our outlook for the business and outcome of the
resubmitted capital plans based on new scenarios we expect to receive later this year.
In the second quarter, we opportunistically issued $1 billion in preferred stock and we think this gives us
opportunity to restack our capital down the road. Longer term, our growth is not dependent on increasing risk
weighted assets, which gives us the ability to return at least 100% of capital to shareholders. And we're confident
in our ability to continue returning attractive levels of capital.
And while the outlook for the economy remains uncertain for the foreseeable future, I know that we will continue
to navigate this environment well, by deepening our client engagement as demand for our service grows,
benefiting from improving quality and improving efficiency of our operations.
Last week, we announced that with the upcoming retirement of Mitchell Harris, we've elevated Hanneke Smits to
CEO of Investment Management effective October 1. Hanneke has been leading Newton Investment
Management since 2016 and has spearheaded Newton's business momentum and client centric culture. Under
Mitchell's leadership, we've made great progress in building a diversified investment management business and
we thank him for that.
As we move forward, Hanneke is ideally suited to build on the strong foundation to continue to drive performance
and innovation across our investment products. Catherine Keating will continue in her role as CEO of BNY Mellon
Wealth Management and both Catherine and Hanneke will report directly to me.

Mitchell has cultivated a strong bench of leaders, including Hanneke and Catherine who will continue to drive the
execution of our strategic priorities to deliver leading investment solutions to our clients underpinned by
exceptional investment performance.
Now before I hand it over to Mike, let me address how we've been responding to recent events that have drawn
attention to the very real racial and societal issues in our communities. Our board and our executive committee
are passionate about using our voices and being positive change agents. As a company, we take great pride and
all of our differences and our diversity of experiences and perspectives leads to better business outcome. That
starts with the diversity of our board, which is 30% African-American, 40% minorities, and 30% female.
We are challenging ourselves to do more. We're supporting activities that create sustainable change, including
philanthropy targeted at creating opportunity, matching employee donations to nonprofits that support and
strengthen the wellbeing of underrepresented communities, encouraging community volunteerism, doing pro bono
legal work to advance minority businesses, raising cultural awareness and strengthening our commitment to
attract, develop and retain a diverse workforce.
We're holding more open forums that foster meaningful dialogue and that we hope will bring us closer together
during these challenging times. We're learning from each other, building empathy and strengthening inclusive
leadership skills that will serve us well and continuing to drive a high performance culture. We're expanding
support for the wellbeing and emotional resilience of our people and their families with additional employee
services, resources and coaches who have called cultural competence.
We know these efforts, like all the other components of our corporate social responsibility strategy are making us
a stronger company. Last week, we released our 2019 CSR report, which introduces our new strategy pillars, with
associated goals and key performance indicators for the next five years. They include increasing senior
leadership positions held by women, and ethnically and racially diverse employees. While we're proud that for the
sixth consecutive year, we've been named to the Dow Jones Sustainable World Index (sic) [Dow Jones
Sustainability World Index]. We're going to continue to challenge ourselves to do more.
In the long run, we firmly believe that doing what's right for the community, our employees and our clients is in the
best interest of our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike.

Thanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Let me run through the details of our results for the quarter and all
comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis, unless I specify otherwise.
Beginning on page 3 of the financial highlights document. In the second quarter of 2020, we reported earnings of
$901 million, down 7%, while earnings per share was flat at the $1.01. Total revenue was $4 billion, up 2% even
as we felt the impact of lower interest rates through money markets fee waivers and our net interest income.
Fee revenue increased 2% primarily reflecting higher fee in Pershing and Asset Servicing, partially offset by
money market fee waivers, lower investment management fees and the unfavorable impact of a stronger US
dollar. Fee waivers negatively impacted growth by approximately 3%.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Net interest revenue declined 3% year-over-year to $780 million, and was down 4% versus the prior quarter. Our
provision for credit losses was $143 million in the quarter. And this was primarily driven by ratings downgrades
particularly across a commercial real estate book, and the continuation of a challenging macroeconomic outlook.
We had no actual charge-offs during the quarter.
Expenses were up approximately 1% as we continue to balance ongoing expense discipline with our technology
investments and we still expect full year expenses to be flat to last year. We had a solid return on tangible equity
of 19% and maintained pre-tax margin of over 29%.
Now moving to capital and liquidity on page 4. Our capital and liquidity ratios remain strong and well above
internal targets and regulatory minimums. In terms of shareholder capital returns, in the second quarter, we
suspended share repurchases along with other Financial Services Forum member banks and will do so again in
the third quarter in line with Federal Reserve requirements. We continue to pay our quarterly cash dividend, which
totaled $278 million in the second quarter, and believe we have ample capacity to continue to pay the dividend on
a variety of economic scenarios.
Common Equity Tier 1 capital totaled $20 billion at June 30, and our CET1 ratio was 12.6% under the advanced
approach and 12.7% under the standardized approach. Under the new stress capital buffer rules that will become
effective October 1, we will need to maintain a CET1 ratio of 8.5%, including a 2.5% stress capital buffer, which is
the minimum, and a 1.5% G-SIB surcharge.
Now as we think about our binding capital ratio constraint going forward, Tier 1 leverage can be more binding
than CET1 due to the buffers we need to hold for potential growth in deposits, which are more volatile than RWA
during times of market volatility, very much like what we've seen over the last two quarters. As always, we will
continue to optimize our capital ratios across all the constraints. Our average LCR in the second quarter was
112%.
Now turning to page 5. My comments on the interest revenue will highlight the sequential changes. Net interest
revenue was $780 million, down 4%. While client-driven deposit growth drove the increase in our average
balance sheet, this benefit was more than offset by full quarter impact of lower interest rates.
Hedging activity added modestly to the linked quarter comparison, as you can see on the bar chart, and is
primarily offset in foreign exchange and other trading fees. Average deposit balances were up $25 billion versus
the first quarter averages and are up $62 billion or 28% versus last year. This growth is across all of our
businesses, some increasing from the monetary reserves in the system, [ph] client's plan to (00:16:32) cash and
some from internal deposit initiatives that are linked to operational and fee generating activities.
As we've mentioned in the past, we generate and manage significant amount of cash across our franchise. This is
a key client differentiator for us, particularly in volatile markets. We provide cash management services that have
led to good growth in deposits in our balance sheet, growth in money market funds in our open architecture
money market investment platform and through Dreyfus cash products.
We've passed along the Fed rate cuts as interest bearing deposit rates declined to minus 3 basis points in the
second quarter. This was the result of the combination of very low rates paid in the US, plus negative rates on
euro-denominated deposits. As a reminder, approximately 25% of our deposits are non-US dollar.
On average, the securities portfolio increased approximately $19 billion versus the first quarter and around $32
billion in the last year as we have deployed the growing deposit base.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
The net interest margin of 88 basis points was down 13 basis points versus the first quarter, driven by the
increase in deposits and lower yielding, low risk interest-earning assets. We continue to focus on optimizing net
interest revenue rather than just net interest margin.
Now, moving to page 6 which provides some color on our asset mix. Our average interest-earning assets
increased to $358 billion, approximately 40% of these assets are held in cash or reverse repos, while 43% are in
our securities portfolio and 16% in our loan portfolio.
In addition to the funded loan shown on the page, we also have unfunded committed lines, the details of which
can be found in the 10-Q. During the quarter, we saw about $1 billion of the $3 billion of borrowings drawn down
from revolving credit facilities repaid, and we're closely monitoring the portfolio, particularly the commercial real
estate exposure and other sectors more acutely impacted by the current environment. The impacted credits,
including commercial real estate, are performing well, but may see additional downgrades depending on the
shape and speed of the recovery.
Turning to the securities portfolio. We have a high quality liquid portfolio, much of it is in the US government
agency securities, US treasuries and sovereign debt. The portfolio increased as we deployed more cash into
securities, including the commercial paper and CDs we purchased from our affiliated and third-party money
market funds.
The $4 billion of CLOs are highly rated with 99% AAA or AA, 100% of the non-agency CMBS are AAA and have
solid subordination. The rest of the ratings breakdown can be found in the supplement.
Page 7 provides an overview on expenses. On a consolidated basis, expenses of $2.7 billion were up around 1%,
driven by higher technology expenses and pension costs, offset by lower business development expenses, mainly
travel and marketing, and the favorable impact of a stronger US dollar. Distribution expenses were only slightly
impacted by money market fee waivers and investment management, as the bulk of the impact from money
market fee waivers was in Pershing and from third-party funds.
Turning to page 8, total investment services revenue was up 3%. Assets under custody and/or administration
increased 5% year-over-year to $37.3 trillion, primarily reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the
unfavorable impact of a stronger US dollar.
Foreign exchange and other trading revenue in the segment increased 16% year-over-year, driven primarily by
higher volatility as well as organic client growth in foreign exchange, even as industry volumes were down slightly.
Within asset servicing, revenue was up 5% to $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting higher FX, higher client volumes
across securities lending, liquidity services and transaction volumes as well as a one-time fee. Securities lending
revenues were higher on improved spread and a strong demand for US government bonds.
In Pershing, revenue was up 1% to $578 million, despite the impact of money market fee waivers, reflecting much
higher money market fund balances, which were up 40%, and higher transaction volumes but down from the
exceptional volumes we experienced in the first quarter.
The net impact of money market fee waivers, partially offset by higher money market fund balances, negatively
impacted Pershing's revenue growth by 3%. Issuer services revenue decreased 3% to $431 million, reflecting
declines in both Corporate Trust and Depositary Receipts revenue.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Depositary Receipts revenue was primarily impacted by lower corporate action volumes, while in Corporate Trust,
new business and deposit growth was offset by lower volumes of new products and interest rates.
Treasury services revenue was up 7% to $340 million, driven by higher liquidity balances and related fees, offset
by lower payment volumes correlated to lower economic activity. Deposit balances increased year-on-year by
40% as investments in new capabilities and increased focus on deposit gathering were critical to retaining most of
the growth from earlier in the year.
Clearance and collateral management revenue was up 4% to $295 million from higher clearance volumes, mostly
from non-US clients as well as fees and deposit balances. Average tri-party collateral management balances
were up 4% in the US and 9% outside the US.
Page 9 summarizes the key drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of our
investment services businesses.
Now turning to investment and wealth management on page 10. Total investment in wealth management revenue
was down 3%. Investment management revenue was roughly flat to $621 million, reflecting the unfavorable
change in the mix of assets under management since the second quarter of 2019 and the impact of money
market fee waivers, partially offset by equity investment gains, net of hedges, including seed capital.
Please note the gains from seed capital include results from unconsolidated and consolidated investment
management funds, both of which can be lumpy in any given quarter, depending on market conditions. Details
can be found in the supplement on the consolidated income statement, the gains are either in investment and
other income or income from consolidated investment management funds, while the negative impact from their
hedging were approximately $30 million as recorded in other trading. We had inflows of $20 billion in the quarter,
reflecting continued cash inflows as well as long-term flows into index funds and fixed income.
Overall, assets under management of just under $2 trillion are up 6% year-over-year, primarily due to higher
markets and cash inflows. Wealth management revenue was down 9% year-over-year to $265 million, primarily
reflecting lower net interest revenue due to lower interest rates and client migration to lower fee fixed income and
cash products.
Now a few comments about the third quarter. First, I would caution you, as we did last quarter that the
environment remains fluid and variables are changing quickly. Looking ahead at net interest revenue, we will have
a full quarter of lower rates in the third quarter, especially short-term LIBOR rates, which declined throughout the
second quarter. We have also seen some pickup in prepayment speeds and our mortgage-backed securities
portfolio, given current and expected refinancing volumes. Significant excess liquidity in the system continues to
drive elevated deposit levels versus 2019, but the exit rate from Q2 is just a little lower than the average for the
quarter.
And as a result, we currently expect net interest revenue to decline 8% to 11% sequentially. However, based on
current market conditions, we would expect net interest revenue to begin to stabilize in the third quarter.
Now in money market fee waivers, the pre-tax impact in the second quarter was $80 million, net of distribution
expense, with the biggest impact in Pershing. It's important to note that approximately $50 million of this impact
has been offset by a substantial increase in money market fund balances, resulting in a net impact of
approximately $30 million in the second quarter. We expect the impact from fee waivers to increase in the third

quarter by about $30 million to $45 million net of lower distribution expenses. This additional impact in the third
quarter would also be reduced if money market fund balances continue to grow. A little over half of that impact will
be in Pershing with the rest of the investment management and asset servicing.
We currently expect that we will incur an incremental $25 million in the fourth quarter and will be at a full run rate
impact from fee waivers of about $135 million to $150 million offset by the incremental money market fund
balance growth that we've seen in the second quarter for net impact of about $85 million to $100 million per
quarter by year end. This quarterly impact could be reduced if money market fund balances continue to grow
further.
Current equity market level should be modest positive, if they hold. We saw transactional activity in FX continue to
normalize over the course of the second quarter and assuming this continues – will be modest headwind
sequentially, although we expect the related fees will be higher than in the prior year. If we see some volatility in
the equity markets, transactional activity could pick up.
On expenses, we will expect them to be flat versus 2019, excluding notable items, this includes the 50 basis point
full year-over-year impact from higher pension expense. Credit costs will be highly dependent upon individual
credits, the future path of the health crisis and how the economics forecast changed by the time we get to the end
of the third quarter. In terms of our effective tax rate, while a little lower this quarter, we expect it to be
approximately 20% for the full year versus prior guidance of 20% to 21%.
With that, operator, can we please open the lines up for questions.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time this morning. A couple of questions. One, Todd, you mentioned the virtual
presentation that you gave or the virtual conference that you gave and I wanted to understand how important that
is for generating new client activity? And if you think that that virtual kind of format and forum can deliver the same
kind of client activity growth that you've seen in prior years [ph] with (00:27:03) face to face?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yes. First of all, in terms of engaging with our clients, it's been pretty effective. I think initially, I think there was a
little reticence as we moved into the crisis, but now we basically see this as our BAU and so both clients and I
think ourselves have gotten quite a bit better at managing the technology to actually communicate and connect
and share what we're doing.
So this particular conference where we had about 1,000 clients and vendors come into it, was – we also posted
on our website, a whole series of detailed analysis of some of the new capabilities that are out there and available
to them and the hits against that have been very high, so I think it's been pretty effective. We've actually seen the

pipeline grow. We've also seen retention high and actually, sales were up in the first half of the year over where
we were last year.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thanks. And then Mike on the guidance, can we just dig in a little bit on the NII [ph]
contra that (00:28:12) you gave? I think you said NII down 8% to 11%. Maybe just give us some color on the
drivers there? And is it – and why do you see it ameliorating as you go into 3Q and 4Q? And if you could give us a
sense of the differences in the drivers between deposit growth and yield compression, that would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yes, sure, Betsy. So I think when you look at the third quarter, it's really all about rates coming down and getting
the full impact of that for the full quarter, that's really the primary driver. And there's a series of actions that I think
you can see that we're taking in the results, both in increasing the securities portfolio and optimizing sort of how
we're investing there.
And so I think as you sort of look out past the third quarter and you look at all the actions we're taking, plus you
look at where the forward curves are, that gives us some confidence that it begins to stabilize in the third quarter
as you look forward. And obviously, the forward view on deposits will sort of have some impact on that but the
marginal dollar gets a little less impactful with rates where they are. So...

ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the rate impact, we used to think an anchor might be the
2015 NIM low. But I guess, I appreciate the long end has come down more than it was then.
You mentioned focusing on NII over net interest margins, so I guess there could be more down there. So my
quickie is deposits sticking around despite the interest bearing deposit rate being minus 3 basis points. I'm curious
to hear any color on client conversations there and if that's now at its resting point, or is there more room on the
negative side as clients park and have no other alternatives?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Mike, why don't I start that one, and then you can probably give a little bit of color. I think that we're – again, the
mix of deposits makes a big impact, Glenn, on that rate. So there are a fair amount of foreign deposits and
European deposits that are actually carrying a negative rate, and we pass that through the clients.

In the US, with the IOER around 10 basis points, that seems to be anchoring somewhat around that rate, unless
we see changes going on in the money markets, which we haven't seen a whole lot of noise yet. So I think most
of the downside pass-through has already been made. I don't know, Mike, if you have anything to add to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. No, I think that's right. I mean, I think the negative is really driven by euros, as Todd said, Glenn. And when
you look at the US dollar deposits, it's a low-single-digit sort of interest rate paid now on the book. And so there's
not a lot of room to continue to bring that down.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. I appreciate that. One qualifier on the provision. Obviously, we're writing to a worse economic backdrop,
but you also mentioned the impact that downgrades have. So my question is, if we move forward and the
economic scenarios don't change. In other words, we feel like we're kind of where we're at. Will further
downgrades keep – continue to be the gift that keeps giving on the provision? We're just trying to dimensionalize
how much to bake in if the economic scenario doesn't change?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. Mike, do you want to take that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, sure, Todd. So Glenn, I think it's a tough question to ask, right? And so, if things don't get worse from what
is being projected now in the scenarios, then you would expect that the issuer downgrades should be somewhat
limited from here, but there will be idiosyncratic issues that may change some of that. So I think, obviously, these
downgrades and the scenarios are somewhat interrelated as we sort of look at both of them.

Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Mike. Just a follow-up on the fee waiver commentary. Just want to make sure that
we're talking about it the right way in terms of the total number versus the gross. So, are you saying that you'd
expect that growth to continue when you gave us the two sets of numbers, so just the cadence going forward? I
guess, maybe if you can just help us understand the net trajectory from here would be the better way I think to
help us think through that?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Yeah. No, sure. I know – and I can appreciate, it's probably a little complicated. But, so as you sort of look at the
net impact of $80 million to $100 million by the time we get to year-end, underpinning that assumes that balances
holds to about where they are. So, it does not assume that there is additional growth there. And so I think if we do
continue to see growth in the balances, we will see that get offset a bit as we look towards the end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. So right, that net number, the $80 million to $100 million minus $50 million from growth that assumes the
balances are flat from here. Okay. Geographically, a couple of quick things, could you just help us understand the
size of the one-time gain in asset servicing? And then just can you talk through just the income statement line
asset servicing? Just what's happening underneath the surface there in terms of core servicing collateral and
broker-dealer services? Thank, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A

Mike, do you want to that...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. So the one-time fee, Ken, is actually in other income. It's not in the asset servicing fee line. It's not
something we have disclosed exactly what it is, it's not super meaningful, but it does show up in the other income
line. So it doesn't impact your fee, your asset servicing fees at all. As you sort of look at what's underneath asset
servicing and the fee line, I think you're seeing growth in both the clearance and collateral management business
and the asset servicing business, as sort of Todd pointed out the different drivers there that are sort of impacting
that line?

Brian Bedell Q

Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Can you just – one more on the fee waivers. Can we track the level of
money market fund balances? I appreciate, obviously, there's the Dreyfus funds in the asset management
business, but it's also a number of third-party funds on the Pershing platform. So I don't know if you've got that
disclosed for the level of those balances, and if it's something that we can track given the Pershing side, I don't
think we can see?

Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Mike, do you want to take that one?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, sure. And Brian, there's actually a couple of drivers underneath the fund balances. One, we're obviously
seeing is in Pershing, and that's not something that we disclose.
And two, we're also seeing it – growth in asset servicing as well, where we sweep money into money market
funds through our open architecture platforms there [indiscernible] (00:36:35) these numbers are not something
that we disclose. So we've seen growth across the platform, we've seen growth really in all channels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. So you could have an organic growth dynamic in this that's different than the money market fund industry
at large that could keep that – the fee waivers closer or even less than $85 million to $100 million, is that a
feasible conclusion potentially?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, potentially.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then just maybe just to talk on the new business and asset servicing. Todd, you mentioned a lot of
initiatives partly from the tech investments on the database and also the distribution analytics system. Anyway to
frame what type of – or what level of new business you think you're getting from these initiatives in – say in the
next or what you expect in the next, say, six months or so? And any, kind of, revenue impact or growth impact to
asset servicing, you think, as a result of these initiatives?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I think, first of all, some of these are very new and some of the applications that we've just put out there,
we've just gone live in the past month or so.

Brian Bedell Q

Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So our estimate is that we could see some meaningful growth driven by the data and the digital and data analytics
that we're offering that we talked about. So it's just now gathering momentum. There is a lot of discussions. And –
but it's early. We've got a couple of beta clients on it that we described, and they actually participated in the
ENGAGE Conference, both Charles Schwab and Nuveen. But I think underlying that, if you look at our pipeline, if

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So a couple of quick follow-ups, I guess first one is around NIR. So you
guys talked about optimizing NIR off of sort of 3Q trough levels, which makes sense. Can you walk us through
sort of the opportunities that you see to invest some of the excess cash that kind of compiled in the balance sheet
[ph] in the (00:39:17) securities portfolio? So anything specifically you can point to in terms of how much could
ultimately be moved to securities over time, and sort of the yields you guys expect to earn on that?
And then anything you guys could do on the liability side as well. So deposit costs will be kind of what they are
with the market. But curious if there's an opportunity to further restack long-term debt, [ph] want to make sure
(00:39:26) you guys do a little bit of that in the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Mike?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. Yeah. I'll try to get all of those pieces, Alex, or remind me if I don't. So as you, sort of – maybe I'll start with
the last one first. So if you look at the liability side, we're always looking for ways to, sort of, optimize. As you said,
deposit costs are probably near where they're going to bottom in the US, but on the margin, there may be a little
bit here and there with particular clients.
On the long-term debt side, we are looking at optimizing that more. I think you'll see us kind of bring that down
maybe just a little bit as we sort of look forward over the next quarter. But I think, obviously, we need to keep
enough long-term debt to meet a bunch of different constraints that we've got, but I do think there's a little bit of
opportunity to optimize that as we look forward.
On the securities side, you can see the increases over – sequentially and year-on-year are pretty significant in
terms of what we've been able to redeploy. The majority of that has gone into sort of highly liquid assets, sort of
HQLA as sort of the term goes, right. And I think you'll see us continue to put more into HQLA assets as well as
look for opportunities where we can get the right risk profile and the right return for some less liquid assets as we
sort of look forward.
And as we sort of get more experience with the deposit base – and we've been talking about this now for a couple
of quarters, as we sort of see the behavior of the deposits come on to the balance sheet, each month, every 30,
60, 90 days, you get a better sense of what the operational nature and the duration of those deposits are going to
look like. And so you can sort of keep – you can keep optimizing how much you're going to deploy each month

and each quarter as you look forward. And so we're doing that. So we still think there's some opportunity to
continue to deploy more.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And my second question is around the expense outlook. I think early in the quarter, you guys
spoke at a conference and the outlook for expenses for 2020, I believe, was flat to down and it sounds like it's flat
now. So what's changed or could expenses still decline this year? And maybe just a quick reminder in terms of
how much incremental tech spend is running through P&L in 2020, which part of that, I guess, is supposed to
phase out into 2021. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay, Mike, why don't I start with this and maybe you can add some additional color. I think we've guided for a
while that will be flat or around flat for the rest of the year and I'm confident that we'll do that at least at or better.
And as we look out to next year, I think we've got significant opportunities around our efficiency programs,
especially in operations. And the increased spend that we've made over the past couple of years in tech will begin
to abate as the investments in infrastructure and resiliency will be largely behind us. So, we think we've got more
that we can do here looking out over the next year or two.
Mike, why don't you give a little more color around the tech spend?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Look, I think as we've talked about that in the last couple of years, as Todd said, we've been making those
investments in the operating platform as well as other capabilities like you talked about with data and analytics
and other new products across the different businesses. And I think while the growth rate has been slowing over
the last year, I think, as Todd said, we've got much more flexibility to sort of look at that as we sort of exit the year.
The only other thing I'd add is, we're seeing the benefit of the efficiencies come through. We're spending less in
operations this year than we did last year. We're going to spend less next year than we did this year. And we feel
very confident that we've got line of sight to continue to execute on the efficiency agenda, as Todd mentioned.

Thomas P. Gibbons A

[ph] And I think in (43:56) 2020, Alex, I'll add to that, I think we probably made the biggest spend that we've made
and in fact, in increasing efficiencies across – operating efficiencies across the company.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Well, first, actually, I'd like to just start with a request. The fee
waiver dynamic is – seems like there's a lot of moving parts. Just something to consider for coming quarters,
maybe a little enhanced disclosure or maybe a memo disclosure, so we could try to consider how to model some
of these components, given that there's balance movement and all this other stuff. I know it's probably tricky but it
might help.
But taking a step back, widening back the lens a little, we're clearly in a rate environment that's a lot more
challenging for your business model. The idea that monetary policy, low rates as a monetary policy tool, this
certainly seems to be now the new normal and it's not a temporary thing that we're all dealing with here. Are you
starting to think about different ways in which you can engage with your customer base, different ways in which
you can structure your relationships and the deposit dynamics, so you can have more confidence in the duration
of the deposits?
How are you making adjustments – or how are you thinking about making adjustments to sort of the fundamental
ways in which you engage with your customers, so you can ensure that you can monetize the components of all
these relationships in the most effective way, given low rates are going to be around for probably some time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So Mike, why don't I take that? And then I think you can add some color to it. So first of all, Brennan, the
comments around the fee waivers, we'll take that to heart. I want to make sure something's clear because there
might be a little confusion here.
What we've indicated is that we think that the full impact of interest rates to our net interest income will begin to
stabilize in the third quarter, which is basically saying that we're coming out with approximately that run rate as we
go forward. And that's taking into consideration what we know today with the shape of the yield curve. So we see
some stability here as we reset around the very low interest rate environment as we fully reset around it.
That same impact is going to be fully reset through fee waivers by the end of the year. And if you look at the
disclosures, that Mike had given you, it's very specific to what that is. We don't know what the actual balances are
going to be. So if the balances grow, then that impact can be quite a bit less, because there'll be additional
income related to money market balances. So I wanted to make that clear.
In terms of how we're working with our clients and pricing, whether it's around – whether it's directly around
deposit activity or our treasury services, they're certainly taking the interest rate environment into consideration,
and anytime we put together more of our platform business like an asset servicing. We take that into the pricing
discussion, taking whatever market conditions would be likely implication to our margins and that type of activity.
So we're doing that on a day-to-day basis. Mike, you have anything to add to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
No, I think that's right. And we're continuing to have a pretty close dialogue with a lot of the clients that have large
or medium-sized sort of balances with us. And I think in part, as you look at a business like treasury services, it's
17

The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
(BK) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
ensuring that we get our fair share of the payments business and the fee revenue that comes along with having
these balances.
And so, I think, it's not only about optimizing sort of their reinvestment side of the balance sheet, it's also about
making sure that we're monetizing the fee relationship with these clients as well. And that's as much a focus for
us and our clients and sales folks as is the balance sheet side of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. No, I appreciate that, and that's all very, very fair. When we think about capital, you flagged the strong
showing of Bank of New York through the DFAST process. Can you talk about, like, clearly, you have a low risk
model, it was clearly showcased during the DFAST.
But because you're categorized as a G-SIB, you are now continue – you're constrained in the ability to return
capital. And so, even though you're pretty far above a lot of your requirements, you cannot manage the capital
base as much as you will. How is the engagement with the regulators as far as trying to point that out, is there
going to be a staggered start based upon risk – inherent risk in the business model where the G-SIBs that are
lower risk should be able to start returning capital sooner? Or is this going to be one of these things that all the G-
SIBs are lumped together? And therefore, firms that have really, really minimal credit risk profiles like BK end up
at the same starting line as some of the big investment banks and commercial banks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. So, Mike, I'll start with this one, too. So, I mean, as you know, the stress test is idiosyncratic test for us. And
so as we go through it, we have performed quite well. We have submitted our capital action plans, and we have
indicated that we will look – and we performed quite well. I know, there's going to be a reevaluation using some
new scenarios that [indiscernible] (00:50:04) sometime at the end of the third or particularly fourth quarter. And so
we'll go through that process.
That being said, we expect to perform quite well, just given the resiliency, as you pointed out, of our balance
sheet and our business model. One of those things that comes out of the new stressed capital buffer, the SCB
model is that – as you get a little more flexibility around your buybacks, you don't have to – you're not limited on a
quarterly basis. You just need to stay within your SCB.
So there could be a timing difference based on whatever regulatory considerations or the environment might look
like. But ultimately, as we accrete capital, that just puts us in a stronger position to buy it back when the
opportunity arises. So I like the way we are accreting capital, and I think that puts us in a position to buyback a
considerable amount of stock as soon as possible.

Michael Carrier Q

Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. So first, I just want to try to understand the [indiscernible]
(00:51:29) COVID impact and could normalize ahead. So any color on how much the deposit balance growth has
been driven by some of the policy responses could normalize. And then you guys noted if new business wins and

that's an area that would have expected to be a bit more challenging just in this environment? And so have you
seen much impact? And do you see like a pipeline forming potentially start to normalize as we get back?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So Mike, can you clarify the first part of that question? I didn't quite catch it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah, sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Your first part [indiscernible] (00:52:11).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah, sure. The first part was just on the growth in deposit balances. I know it's hard to determine it exactly would
drive some of those balances. But some firms have tried to quantify what's been kind of impacted by the
coronavirus and some of the policy responses versus what's more sort of core business operations. That is the
first part.
And then the second part was just on the new business wins, would have expected that to be a little bit more
challenging environment, but it seems like, you continue to have some decent wins there. So just wanted to try to
gauge how has that been impacted by this environment in terms of the pipeline?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. Mike, do you want to take the deposit component of the question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Sure, Mike. So as you sort of look at what's happened since the middle of March, what you saw was this
massive increase. And if you recall what our spot balance was at the end of the first quarter, it was $337 billion in
terms of deposits. And so, that huge volatile piece of the deposit balance has come off already.
And as you can see where we were for the quarter in the 280s in terms of the average. And so you've already
seen that sort of massive spike retreat. And so while it's – in hindsight, you'll have a better view in terms of what's
driven the increase from the February balances of around $230 million to where we are today. But I think, it's hard
to ignore that the environment that's been caused – the economic environment that's been caused by the
pandemic is a big driver of the pace at which those deposits have increased from the February levels.
But as we look forward, while we're in this environment, for sure, it feels like we're in this environment for longer.
It's hard to see given all of the response, the policy, monetary policy response from the Fed and others that the
balances would retreat much more from where they are.

Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
And I can take the second component of your question, Mike, which was around the new business wins. I mean
clients are still making servicer decisions. And relative to last year, we've probably seen – we've been winning
and retaining more deals and higher value deals, which is important. I think we've learned how to work from
home. We've ramped up our focus on client management over that time. And we're actually seeing an increase in
activity with reviews and presentations being done virtually. And we've got some nice wins around EPS around
our mid-office space and we continue to implement at a rapid pace against the mid-office. We've got the TALF
servicing related wins as well. So, the pipeline remains strong. I think we're getting used to this as being the
current normal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then Mike, just a quick cleanup, there were just a few [ph] positive (00:55:45) items in any
quarter. I think some like investment gains in funds. And then you mentioned that other investment in income [ph]
net (00:55:52) asset servicing fee. Away from that, I'm assuming that most of it was just market related, just given
what we saw in the quarter. But were there any other factors, in today's line items, I'm assuming we just expect
that to normalize lower ahead, but if any color are there any other nuances there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
No. I think it's pretty straightforward on those investment and other income. You can kind of see the breakdown of
that in supplement and the thing that will be in the other income line that will be volatile. Obviously, you see
capital and how the market sort of moves within the quarter. And then the other trading line, you'll have some
impact there as well from the same moves.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I'm just trying to reconcile a couple of thoughts. Todd, you had some really positive comments with your
introductory remarks and maybe you can elaborate some on your work with the government and what kind of fees
you get from that and how sustainable those fees are? But then Mike, you certainly commented about the impact
of lower interest rates and you're certainly not sugarcoating that. So that's – try and connect those two different
thoughts?
And the other two different thoughts I have is, you guys are certainly service more fixed income assets than your
peers. So you should be benefiting from that quite a bit. And I'm not sure, if that's showing up as much as you
might expect with the increased fixed income activity? Thank you.

Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Mike, thanks. So in terms of – there are a number of government programs that we're participating are that
we are supporting or administering, some of them are showing some growth. For example, the PDCF is where we
use our tri-party repo system. So it's reflected in the amount of tri-party repo activity, which we did see go up in
the first quarter and sustain itself to a certain extent, although it's starting to come off a little bit in the second and
third quarter. But we are seeing good activity on the global side of the tri-party book.
And it's really going to – it's going to be a matter of how much those programs are taken up before we see any
revenue. I think the more important is the other component of our revenue growth across our investment services
business. In terms of the fixed income activity, where you're seeing in clearing and collateral management, you
are seeing increased clearing volumes on our clearing platform and we are benefiting to a certain extent from
that. And I think that was reflected. If you looked at the investment services uptick and the highlights, you could
see that.
And I think we've been very directive where we are with the interest rates. But I think the important thing to know
is that, we are – we see ourselves reaching a bottom here in a very short period of time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So when you add it all together, do you think – you said flat expenses for the year, revenues, any guidance for the
year for that relative to those expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Well, I think that the headwinds for revenues, we've disclosed to you. And that's all interest rate related.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And so do you think you can get flat operating leverage this year or positive or negative, are you just don't
want to make a call on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Right now, I wouldn't make a call on that just given the uncertainty around some of those elements.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Lastly, you are investing in technology. So that – you said that's elevated this year, and that should fall off
some next year. So that's – you're not going to sacrifice those investments for the long-term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
That's correct. That's correct, Mike. I mean we – in fact, the investments we made in operating efficiencies that
we'll see the benefit over the next couple of years is the highest we've ever made – will be the highest we've ever
made in 2020.

Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Good morning, guys. There have been some headlines that some of your peers are rolling out what seems to be
a similar integration and partnership you struck with Aladdin and BlackRock. Can you talk about what you're
seeing on that front and maybe highlight what you think differentiates your integration there versus some of the
other options?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Mike, do you want to do that one or you want me to take it. Why don't you take it Mike?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, sure. Hey, Rob. Look, I think as you would expect, BlackRock works with a whole series of providers and
those providers would use Aladdin in some form or fashion. And I think that's to be expected and was happening
already.
I think the good news is, we're the only provider that has all our capabilities embedded inside of Aladdin. And so
the widgets or the capabilities of the functionality that we've built are actually accessible through Aladdin, and
we're the only ones that you can do that. So I think we've got a really strong relationship with BlackRock on the
servicing side and the partnership side, and we look forward to continuing to build new capabilities with them that
continue to differentiate what our common clients can do versus others, but we do think there's some differences
there.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Todd. Good morning, Mike. The question I have has to do with the credit quality.
Clearly, you guys are not a credit-centric bank, like some of the universal banks. Can you give us some color on
the provision that you put up, what you build out your portfolio. When is that provision allocated to that portfolio?
And is it just general allocations or were there some specific reserves that you put against specific loans?

Mike, do you want to take it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, Gerard. So I would say generally, the build was related to commercial real estate portion of the portfolio.
That's certainly where the biggest piece of it was. It's not a general sort of allocation. Obviously, it's a very
detailed sort of name-by-name, and then you apply all the modeling that goes around with it. But as you sort of
look at the build, the biggest portion of it would be related to the commercial real estate portion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then coming back to the deposit rates, you [ph] saw about (01:03:34) I guess, 11% or 12%
increase in your foreign office deposits. And the average rate went from the first quarter, [ph] you paid (01:03:43)
20 basis points, I think, or 29 basis points down to negative 12 basis points. What interest rates should we be
watching overseas toward the negative rates? And you had the growth even though you went to negative rates,
[ph] are (01:04:00) deposits essentially inelastic, meaning is there a point where you would be concerned that
people would move money out if the negative rates [ph] went too negative (01:03:50)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Mike, do you want to take that? [indiscernible] (01:03:55) 29 to 12 basis points, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. And Gerard, when you look at the disclosure there, domestic versus foreign offices, that doesn't necessarily
denote currency denomination, a good chunk of the deposits in the foreign offices are actually US dollar deposits.
And so I think you really sort of need to look at the rate in aggregate when you think about what's happened over
the quarter.
I think when you look at the – and so as you sort of look at that rate coming down, the biggest driver of the rate
coming down in the foreign offices is actually us paying lower amounts on US dollars, not increased negative
rates outside the US. But obviously, the biggest driver for us other than US dollar is going to be our euro deposits
when you think about negative rates, and that's something we're focused on.
I think when you think about our deposits inelastic, I think there's a portion of the deposits that are very much tied
to the underlying operational activity. And so I think that there is – we have – when we charge clients for negative
rates, there are spreads attached to those negative rates and we haven't seen much movement as a result of the
pricing and the spreads that we've applied to those deposits.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Just a real quick question first on that tax rate guide, I mean you gave it for the full year this year,
but is that also a good number to use on a go forward basis, the 20%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Mike?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
I would probably think 20% to 21% [ph] and just sort of (01:06:05) look forward based on what we know today, but
I think for this year, it's definitely closer to 20%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the expenses, I heard the [ph] tech expense (01:05:56) guide this year,
but obviously, there's a lot of kind of one-timers and unique nature going on given the current situation. So, is the
right way to think about expenses as we look forward to 2021 and that there should be a natural downward
progression to expenses just as these one-timers go away, and then the rest of it [ph] as you think (01:06:34)
about expenses is really going to be driven by revenue growth in the next year, so that there is some kind of
downward bias on expenses to start with for 2021?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Well, yeah. But I had indicated there are a couple of good things. Number one is I think the efficiencies that we've
invested in will continue to register themselves next year and over the next couple of years. And we're not slowing
down on that. There's a lot more automation, there are a lot of additional things that we can do to make ourselves
more efficient and actually improve the client experience at the same time.
And on top of that, we have been growing our tech expense quite a bit over the past three years. A lot of that was
infrastructure, resiliency as well as some of the efficiency investments and some of the product capabilities. We
think a fair amount of the infrastructure component of that will be behind us, which should give us a bit of a
tailwind as we look out over the next couple of years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. And next in queue we have a follow-up question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks so much for taking my follow-up. Mike, just maybe just to dive in a little bit more on the balance
sheet. Deposit levels, I think, at period end were up at $305 million versus the $283 million average. So maybe
just some commentary on whether you think that was the typical quarter end spike? Or do you think those levels
are – the period levels of deposits are sustainable as you see it right now in 3Q?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
And then just on the securities mix that you talked about moving more short-term, shifting the balance sheet
composition towards securities as you get confidence in this durability of the deposits. What type of level do you
think that mix could go up to from the 43%, because I guess you could potentially get some NIM expansion [ph]
after this bottoms (01:08:22) in 3Q, if you do that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. I'll start with the first one, Brian. I think the – you can't read much into one day's worth of deposit balances.
And so I would sort of put that in the bucket of a typical quarter end spot number. And so sometimes, that will be
higher, sometimes that will be lower. And there was one deposit that sort of drove that up a little bit for a particular
client. So I think the guidance I gave around the current levels are slightly below where the average was, is
probably a good way to sort of think about where we are right now.
I think as you sort of think about how much we can deploy into the securities portfolio, I think that's something
that's dynamic [ph] based on (01:09:36) sort of how we feel about the stability and the longevity of those deposits
[audio gap] (01:09:43) you'll see us continue to optimize as we go into the quarter. It's not something we'll give
you a specific percentage on, because obviously, there are other drivers of that, but we do think there's continued
opportunity there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the deposits and money market fund balances, are you agnostic mostly
between that client usage as that cash moves around between third-party money market balances and Dreyfus,
of course, as well versus the deposits on the balance sheet in those programs? I guess, the question there, are
you agnostic as to where that lands? Or are you are you trying to favor one area over the other in terms of
revenue generation capabilities, I guess, on the fee versus the balance sheet side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Do you want me to take that, Todd?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, Mike, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
I think the answer is, it depends, Brian. I think when you think about short-term balances that we know won't be
around for very long, I think we are relatively agnostic with IOER at 10 basis points of where they go, whether it's
in a money market fund or on the balance sheet, I think we'll earn about the same. I think as you sort of think
about operational deposits, we are – over time, we'll make more money with them being on the balance sheet.

Operator: We also do have a follow-up question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, thanks for the follow-up guys. Sorry [indiscernible] (01:11:05), but back to this money market fund dynamic
real quick. So Mike, I think on the last update, you guys had said you expect the pre-tax impact on a quarterly
basis from money market fee waivers to be about $50 million to $75 million. And you talked about that being
probably at the higher end of that range in the second quarter. Now you guys guide into $80 million to $100
million by the end of the year. So I just want to make sure that these two numbers are kind of comparable. And
essentially, we're at least talking about $20 million more in sort of incremental pre-tax input from fee waivers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. It's a good question, Alex. I think the – when you look at the $50 million to $75 million, at that point, it was
unclear what was going to happen with money fund balances. And so I think the $50 million to $75 million was the
gross impact and as we sort of look at the $85 million to $100 million, that's the net impact of now is accounting
for the fact that we think the balance growth that we saw is going to stick with us for a while. So if you look at what
I gave in my script, I said by the fourth quarter, the gross impact will be $135 million to $150 million, which is
equivalent to that $50 million to $75 million, but it will be offset by the fact that we think the balances will stick
around. So that's how you get that size to $100 million.
