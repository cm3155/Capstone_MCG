Well, thank you. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Today, we reported third quarter net
income of $251 million or $1.84 per share. Moderation per share exceeding expectations. [indiscernible] (02:03)
optimization and moderation in customer demand drove a decline in average loans to $54 billion. Successful
execution of our targeted deposit strategy grew customer balances, enabling us to repay $5 billion in maturing
FHLB advances. Our continued focus on fee income produced another robust quarter. And credit quality
remained very strong, with modest net charge-offs following three consecutive quarters of net recoveries.
Complementing our compelling financial results, we advanced other strategic initiatives. Small business remains a
priority, and I'm excited to announce that we exceeded our $5 billion lending goal ahead of our three-year
commitment. With our investments in talent, products and services for this important sector, we believe small
business will become a growth engine over time.
Achievement such as publishing our first finance submissions report, making community development
investments, and recognition for our volunteer program, further underscore the value we place on supporting the
communities we serve. Advancing our Ameriprise partnership and selective talent acquisition within wealth

management positioned us to achieve our non-interest income objectives while deepening customer
relationships.
We continue modernizing our approach to technology to better enable agile product enhancements as we
leverage off-premise platforms to run over three quarters of our business applications. Progress towards these
initiatives allow us to balance the strength of our legacy for the future vision to sustainably support our customers
as a trusted banking partner.
Moving to a summary of our results on slide 4, average loans declined $1.4 billion, with the largest reduction
resulting from our strategic exit of Mortgage Banker Finance. Success winning new deposits and bringing back
customer balances drove an increase in average deposits of $1.6 billion. Net interest income exceeded
expectations for the quarter, even with the impact of competitive deposit pricing and loan trends. Credit quality
remained very strong despite continued expected migration. Outperformers to non-interest income partially offset
higher than expected expense pressures.
Finally, profitability and loan selectivity further enhanced our capital position as we generated an estimated CET1
ratio of 10.79%, above our 10% target. Despite the disruptive industry events earlier this year, we effectively
managed our balance sheet to create abundant liquidity, enhance returns over time while taking care of our
customers and exceeding profitability expectations.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim who'll walk through the quarter in more detail.

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Thanks, Curt. And good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 5. Our strategic actions and shift optimization caused
average loans and commitments to decline. The exit of Mortgage Banker Finance is progressing as expected and
contributed to almost half of the reduction in average balances. We still expect the exit to be substantially
complete by year-end. Declines in Equity Fund Services were largely concentrated in non-relationship customers,
but we remain committed to this important business. Lower utilization within general Middle Market reduced
balances reflecting softening loan demand in this elevated rate environment.
Ongoing funding of multi-family and industrial construction projects continue to drive higher commercial real
estate utilization. But we saw inflection and commitment growth as we strategically managed pipeline and
origination volume. The floating nature of our commercial loan portfolio benefited from rising rates as loan yields
continued to climb to 6.34% in the third quarter.
Slide 6 demonstrates our successful deposit generation. Average deposit balances increased 2.4%, exceeding
expectations and HA trends as we added new deposits and won back customer balances that diversified earlier in
the year. In fact, corporate banking in Middle Market California both closed the quarter in line with their early
March balances after experiencing more concentrated diversification in Q1.
As expected, non-interest-bearing deposits trended down at a decelerating rate, with the lowest balance decline
in the last four quarters. Considering that modest reduction, our deposit mix was more impacted by growth in the
denominator with success in winning interest-bearing deposits. We continue to view our deposit mix as a
competitive advantage, providing a more stable and cost-effective funding source than our peers. Industry efforts
to enhance liquidity drove competition and when combined with the higher rate environment, deposit costs
increased to 290 basis points, resulting in a cumulative beta of 55%.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
In recent weeks, deposit betas have been moderating and we intend to remain nimble in our relationship pricing
approach. So we are able to balance customer needs with profitability targets while closely monitoring the market.
With an even lower percentage of uninsured deposits, the operating nature of our accounts and an enviable
customer base, we believe our strong deposit profile is now even more attractive.
As shown on slide 7, our effective liquidity strategy and strong deposit growth allowed us to absorb all of our
contractual wholesale funding maturities this quarter. We expect to continue to utilize excess cash to further
reduce wholesale funding in the coming quarters. Our loan to deposit ratio continued to trend favorably, closing at
80% for the quarter. With significant liquidity capacity and very light remaining unsecured funding maturities, we
have flexibility to manage funding needs and are better positioned to prioritize high return growth in 2024.
Period-end balances in our securities portfolio on slide 8 declined $1.1 billion with pay-downs, maturities, and a
$710 million negative mark-to-market adjustment. Although we have nominal Treasury maturities remaining in
2023, larger scheduled maturities and anticipated securities repayments over the next two years are projected to
benefit net interest income and AOCI. Altogether, we project a 25% improvement in unrealized securities losses
over the next two years. This estimated burn off is sensitive to the dynamic rate environment and length in the
quarter end. However, since our portfolio is pledged to enhance our liquidity position, we do not anticipate any
need to sell securities and therefore unrealized losses should not impact income.
Overall, our securities strategy remains unchanged as we stopped reinvesting over a year ago, and we maintain
our entire portfolio as available for sale, providing full transparency and management flexibility. We will continue
to closely monitor final regulatory rules to consider the impact on our securities strategy as we consider the need
for future compliance.
Turning to slide 9, net interest income decreased $20 million to $601 million but outperformed expectations. We
were encouraged by the lower pace of decline in net interest income as we move closer to what we believe may
soon be an inflection point. Competitive deposit pricing and lower loan balances offset the benefits of loan yields
and reduced wholesale funding balances. With the strategic management of our interest rate sensitivity, rates
have nominally impacted income and we remained effectively asset neutral.
As shown on slide 10, successful execution of our interest rate strategy and the current composition of our
balance sheet favorably positioned us with minimal negative exposure to a gradual 100 basis points or 50 basis
points on average decline in interest rates. By strategically managing our swap and securities portfolios while
considering balance sheet dynamics, we intend to maintain our insulated position over time.
Credit quality remains very strong, as highlighted on slide 11. Following three consecutive quarters of net
recoveries, we observed modest net charge-offs of $6 million. As expected, credit migration continued with the
greater concentration in businesses, with more relative exposure to elevated rates and inflationary pressures,
including commercial real estate, leveraged loans, and technology and life sciences. While the economic forecast
improved slightly from the prior quarter, the outlook remains uncertain, which, when coupled with lower loan
balances, which impacted loan mix, contributed to an increase in our allowance for credit losses to 1.38% of total
loans. Notably, non-accrual loans declined for the sixth consecutive quarter and inflows to non-accruals of $14
million also declined. Consistent with our proven credit discipline, we continue to closely monitor our portfolio and
expect further migration to remain manageable.
On slide 12, non-interest income of $295 million was our third highest quarter on record following our second
highest quarter in 2Q. Deferred compensation, which was fully offset in expenses reduced $7 million contributing
5

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
to most of the non-interest income decline. Softer derivative activity more than offset increased loan syndication
fees, pressuring capital markets revenue.
Fiduciary income was negatively impacted by annual fees received in the prior quarter. Movement in the rate
curve benefited risk management hedge income but will vary in the future based on the rate environment and the
position of our hedging portfolio. Growth in non-interest income continues to enhance our overall revenue profile
and capital efficiency over time.
Expenses on slide 13 increased $20 million. Salaries and benefits were up $9 million and $8 million that increases
in temporary labor due to staff augmentation, advancing technology and wealth management initiatives. Outside
processing increased $7 million, driven by certain vendor terms that are sensitive to interest rates and our Trust
platform conversion.
Other expenses benefited from large modernization credits from the sale of real estate, offset by increased
litigation and regulatory related expenses, consulting fees and operational losses. We believe we and the industry
are in a period of calibration as we balance the profitability and risk management impacts from the first quarter,
disruption with strategic investments critical for future growth. We remain committed to managing an efficient
organization and are assessing opportunities to offset some of these pressures so that we may continue to deliver
strong returns over time.
Slide 14 highlights our solid capital position. Capital generation from profitability and lower loan balances drove
our CET1 ratio further above our target to an estimated 10.79%. Our third quarter tangible common equity ratio of
4.62% includes a negative 502 basis point impact from AOCI.
Higher rates increased unrealized losses in our securities and swap portfolios, driving a more negative impact in
prior quarter. Based on the September 30 forward curve, we anticipate approximately a 37% reduction in our
unrealized losses by the end of 2025. Although the proposed capital changes do not apply to us based on our
asset size, we favor a conservative approach to capital management and feel it is prudent to remain mindful of the
regulations as they evolve.
Our outlook for 2023 is on slide 15, and assumes no significant change in the economic environment. We project
full year 2023 average loan growth of 7%, which would be our highest annual loan growth rate in a decade. The
strategic exit of Mortgage Banker Finance and increased selectivity is expected to continue to impact fourth
quarter balances. Our projected full year average deposit decline at 13% improved over prior expectations, with
the success in winning new deposits and bringing back customer balances.
With the exception of the impact from our Mortgage Banker Finance exit and utilizing excess cash to modestly
reduce the maturing broker deposits, we expect deposits to remain relatively flat in the fourth quarter. Our outlook
does not assume a significant benefit from seasonality. But if we did see a return to more normal fourth quarter
seasonal patterns, that may provide more upside than projected. We still expect another record year of net
interest income in 2023, growing 1% to 2% over last year's record results.
Competitive deposit pricing, continued deposit mix change, and a modest decline in loans are expected to drive a
5% to 6% reduction in fourth quarter net interest income. Although short-term rates are expected to remain high
through year-end, our asset sensitivity position is designed to protect our profitability by minimizing the negative
impact of rates when they decline.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
Credit quality remained very strong and we expect continued migration to be manageable. We forecast full year
and fourth quarter annualized net charge-offs to remain below our normal 20 basis point to 40 basis point range.
Non-interest income has exceeded expectations for the first three quarters and we project full year growth of 9%
over 2022. Benefits from non-customer income from FHLB dividends are expected to continue but at declining
rates as we repay maturing advances.
Risk management income is expected to eventually reduce over time with rates and our swap position. For the
fourth quarter, non-interest income is expected to decline 3% to 4%, largely driven by a reduction in capital
markets income considering market dynamics and increased selectivity. Non-interest expenses are expected to
increase approximately 11% year over year, with 3% of that growth attributed to higher 2023 pension expense
and almost 2% due to higher FDIC expense.
Fourth quarter expenses are projected to increase 3% as we observe pressures related to investments in
technology and risk management, in addition to third quarter modernization gains that are not expected to repeat.
While we are not offering 2024 guidance, we are mindful of the need to mitigate expense pressures as we
recognize the new funding paradigm in the industry. These pressures are largely concentrated in the need for
selective ongoing strategic investments in addition to investments to further enhance risk management and
regulatory compliance.
We are in the process of evaluating cost reduction opportunities with the objective of keeping 2024 costs only
modestly higher than 2023. This assumes no change in pension expense, which will be determined largely by
year-end rates and market performance. Prudent expense management remains a priority as we work to balance
our expense base, commensurate with our earnings power.
Strong profitability is expected to further grow our capital position in excess of our 10% target. Share repurchases
remain paused considering the ongoing volatility within unrealized AOCI losses and subject to further regulatory
clarity. In all, it was a solid quarter with strong deposits, liquidity, fee income, and credit. We believe we are in
great shape as we look to finish out the year and prepare for 2024.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Thank you, Jim. Slide 16 summarizes our differentiated value proposition. As a leading bank for business with
strong wealth management and retail capabilities, our tenured colleagues deliver value-added industry expertise
to our blue chip customer base while our highly regarded approach to credit has historically outperformed our
peers.
Complementing our commercial loan expertise, our relationship model is exemplified by products tailored to meet
our customer needs, enhancing revenue and retention. Our deposit profile has long been a strength with a focus
on commercial operating deposits and a consistent retail base. With new products already in the market and
additional efforts underway to expand small business and payments, we expect this core funding source to be
even more compelling.
Finally, we remain committed to running an efficient organization. We'll be taking steps to offset expense
pressures by leveraging investments designed to enhance productivity and optimize resources. Before we open
the line to questions, I just want to comment on what a remarkable quarter we think this was for our company.
After significant industry disruption this past spring, once again, our relationship-based model has proved resilient.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
We're very proud to see a return to deposit growth, especially when the H8 data shows declines across the
industry.
Our liquidity is in great shape. We repaid significant FHLB advances and our loan to deposit ratio puts us in a very
favorable position. Credit remains strong and fee income continues to perform at near record levels. During this
disruptive time, we are taking care of our customers and won back deposits. We've added new relationships and
still exceeded profitability expectations.
As I shared on prior calls throughout our almost 175-year history, we have managed through a number of
challenges and I'm confident in our ability to navigate this environment. We remain focused on our core strategy,
enhancing efficiency, managing risk, protecting returns and positioning for organic growth. With the uncertain
economic landscape and being just under $86 billion in assets, I feel very good about Comerica's position.
We're proud of our colleagues and the performance we delivered. And we appreciate your time this morning. And
now, operator, we'd be happy to take some questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Certainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question today is coming from Jon Arfstrom from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey, good morning. Curt, question for you. Just on one of the last comments
you made about deposit growth, you mentioned that you're adding and bringing back customer deposits. Can you
talk about the extent of what you brought back and why these clients are coming back and kind of the extent of it
and what's left to bring back?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Hey, Jon. This is Peter. So the bringing back clients, I would say a lot of that has occurred probably in our Middle
Market businesses. So if you look back to pre-SCB and Jim mentioned this, for example, Middle Market in
California, corporate banking, we're back to pre-SCB levels and those businesses. But it's true in a couple of our
other businesses as well. Environmental services has that sort of results and Middle Market overall I think has
performed really well. A lot of our new deposit growth, I would say, would be in Middle Market, small business,
business banking, where we're really being aggressive on trying to attract granular deposits, small business
deposits. We're making a lot of investments there in people and product. And so – and that's the success that
we've had. I think, as the year has gone on, the – our customer base and prospects have continued to have a lot
of confidence in our name and our success. And while all the banks were challenged between March and April,
we – I think we've proven to be pretty resilient through this.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Peter Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
I think it's a little bit of both. I think some of it is providing confidence overall that occurred early in the year. But
certainly, you're attracting some of it with interest-bearing rates that we're being competitive on. And I mean, I
think we talk a little bit about what we're seeing on our deposit betas here today. But so it's a little bit of both. I
think some of it's product investment that we've made to make it easier for our customers to manage their
liquidity. But we're certainly doing what we need to do to be competitive with other banks on the interest rate
environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Jim, one for you. You kind of danced around this in terms of you're talking about betas moderating. And we
still have this down net interest income sequentially and down margin. But the way things sit today, if the Fed is
done, what's your best guess on NII inflection for the company?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Jon. And good morning. I do feel like the pathway on that inflection point is becoming a little bit
more into focus, even though there are still some degree of uncertainty. I would say right now, our base case is
that we'll probably hit a trough in Q1. But whether or not that's the inflection point and again, that is the base case.
And more importantly, what that upward slope of the line will be from there really depends on a lot of things. As
you know, a lot of uncertainty out there on deposit betas. The Fed stays higher for longer. How do betas respond.
And just as importantly, rate cuts occur. How much is there in terms of a deposit pricing by monetary policy. Loan
volume, we do anticipate growing at some point in 2024, but certainly variable loan pricing is out there as a
variable. We think that the new funding paradigm commands wider spreads or higher yield, but it remains to be
seen if the market will accept that. So a lot of variables out there, but I'll just circle back and say at this point we
think the trough is likely to be Q1, then a little bit of a slope up from there.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
Maybe, Jim, first for you, looking at the slide 10 rate sensitivity. When we look at – so it looks like obviously you
have not added any new swaps this year. When we look at the trajectory of the swaps in the outlook, [ph] is the
jack (25:41) from the swaps fully baked into as we look into the third quarter or fourth quarter outlook?
Incrementally, does it get worse or does it just level off if rates don't change? And just give us a sense, do you
expect any additional changes around balance sheet mix going into next year and whether or not you're thinking
about protecting eventually against rate cuts or not?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Ebrahim. You were cutting out a little bit, but I think I got the gist of the question. We are relatively interest
neutral, it's how I think of it right now. We do have some swaps that will mature over the next five quarters. But we
also have a number of forward starters that are coming on to the books over the next five quarters also. And so
based on the amount of forward starters that are coming on, and I think we have more forward starters coming on
than maturing swaps, I don't see a need to go out and acquire any more swaps. Now we'll continue to monitor
how the balance sheet responds and non-interest-bearing deposits respond, which have an impact in that
sensitivity equation. But for now, I feel really comfortable that we're well prepared for a drop in rates should they
occur.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And I guess maybe just a separate question on credit quality. Maybe if we can unpack the three areas that you
called out on CRE, leverage loans and tech, like how do you expect the losses to evolve within those three
buckets? And any impact on your sort of auto exposure when we think about the UAW strike? And if that gets
prolonged, if we could see some negative migration or losses?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Ebrahim. Thank you. This is Melinda. I'll just make some overarching comments around credit just to
reiterate what both Curt and Jim said. We're really proud of the quarter. Credit continues to hold up really, really
well. As you can see on slide 11, we did have an increase in our criticized assets. We absolutely projected that
we would continue to see normalization. That is exactly how it's playing out. The majority of the increase in
criticized this quarter came from that commercial real estate book. And as of right now, we do not really see a lot
of loss content in that commercial real estate portfolio. Just as a reminder, we're very heavily concentrated in
construction financing with very strong borrowers and sponsors. Very low loan to cost is really how we underwrite.
And it's predominantly multi-family and industrial.
So industrial segment is holding up incredibly well. We don't have any criticized assets in industrial. Multi-family is
really where we're seeing some of the migration. And that's, again, expected just given what the rate environment
has done, just as well as a bit of oversupply in certain markets. So there is some rent leveling out and starting to
see a little bit of rent concessions. We have no delinquencies, no past dues in this portfolio. Our sponsors are
stepping up as we would have expected them to based on their historical performance, and they are covering
shortfalls. So I do not expect to see losses coming through the commercial real estate portfolio, but cautionary,
we are continuing to build a reserve there. So our coverage ratio is up to 1.58% this quarter, which I think is up 5
or 6 basis points from last quarter.
The charge-offs that we did see this quarter, there is no concentration. It was very granular business banking,
TLS, Middle Market, but they're very small in nature. So I'm not really seeing any themes as of right now in terms
10


Comerica, Inc.

of like where loss content would come from. Leverage would be one that it would be very impossible. Just again,
because of the elevated rate environment and the cumulative impact of the 500 basis points interest burden on
those borrowers.
Automotive production, we've got about $1 billion in automotive production loans. Obviously, we've been in this
business for many, many decades and we've been through many cycles with this customer base. I would say
overall, they are very resilient. This particular pool have been relatively stressed honestly from 2019 on. You have
the 2019 tariff, then you've had COVID, then you had chip shortages and supply chain disruption. But we really
haven't experienced losses in this sector. So we're watching the UAW strike very closely. The longer it goes on,
there will be more impact to the portfolio. We're very well reserved. But again, we have a lot of experience
managing through this, and we have a very, very strong customer base that knows how to do this. So hopefully, I
hit all of your questions. But happy to follow up.

Good morning. On the expense growth commentary for 2024, I know you indicated the objective is for – keep
expense growth modestly higher versus 2023. Can you – it looks like the Street is out there modeling maybe 3%
to 4% or so year-over-year. Can you maybe help us think about what modestly higher could mean? What's a
reasonable pace of growth to assume as you're looking at the initiatives playing out that you're reviewing?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
John, this is Curt. I'll start and then we'll ask Jim to add in some more color commentary. First of all, maybe just
from a backdrop standpoint, as you and others on the call are aware, 2021 and 2022 were really record years of
performance for our company across the board. Revenue growth, loan growth, liquidity, really great performance
from a ROE standpoint. In fact, at the end of 2022, performed in the mid-20% range on ROE and we were able to
do all that and maintain a very low efficiency ratio. As Jim mentioned and I think I did as well in my comments, I
do think that we and the whole industry are in this period of transition and through a recalibration as we're looking
at lower NII really based on funding dynamics.

And then the second thing I'd say here is just that there are some anomalies in our 2023 numbers. We certainly
have a pension impact that others maybe do not have. Everyone has the FDIC component. So when you factor
that out, the rate of growth in 2023 over 2022 is not quite as high as might appear.
That said, we are committed to managing expenses and managing efficiently as a company and as you just said,
and more modest growth in expenses 2023 over 2024. But I want to be careful here and just caution that we have
been in a new investment or net investment focus of the company. We've been doing a lot of things the last two
years that we believe are driving revenue growth for us, helping us on the client acquisition side. A lot of
investment in payments, treasury management, wealth management, capital markets. We've expanded into some
new markets, the Southeast and Colorado, a lot of focus on small business. So we've got a lot of initiatives
underway and I want to keep our focus on those because we believe those are the right things for our company in
long term. And once we get beyond sort of the period of time that we're in right now. But having said all that, we
are going to strike the right balance and we've proven over time in our history that we know how to manage
expenses well. And we are looking at sort of what levers we have. We typically provide some guidance at our
fourth quarter call. I can go into some more details at that point, but we are working on some initiatives we believe
will help us reduce expenses and offset some as what we – I think, is really sort of more near-term pressure
versus longer term pressure. Jim, what would you add to that?

The only thing I would add is we – to reemphasize Curt's comments, we do recognize the new funding paradigm,
the new profitability equation. And I do think there's a lot of work to be done. And we're committed to getting that
work done. And I think we're going to make significant progress for 2024. But I don't view it as a one and done
deal either. I think this is probably going to play out for some period of time, but we have to continue on the cost
reduction initiatives to make sure that we can fund the necessary investments. So something we've done before,
we know how to do, we're committed to. There was a pivot in the industry that's occurred over the last few
months, and we're going to have to adjust to that. But we do recognize that, so fully committed to getting it done
and we'll be sharing more at some later point in time, as Curt said.

Okay. Thank you. I appreciate all that detail. And then separately, I guess when it comes to capital or more
specifically capital deployment, maybe can you talk about what would you need to see to be willing to ramp up
buybacks here? Just want to get your updated thoughts on the potential for deployment. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, John. I would say the number one factor for me is the uncertainty. That would be the uncertainty in the
general economy and geopolitical events and so on, but also uncertainties related to interest rates and AOCI. We
did take a step-up this quarter as the whole industry did. And I'd like to see a better line of sight in terms of where
that's going before we turn on share repurchase. I would say capital rules are something we're watching. Also, I
would say that's more of a secondary factor. We're well below $100 billion, but we do want to be prepared in case
things change in the economy with whether it be monetary policy or anything else that may catapult us towards
$100 billion faster than we're expecting. But the uncertainty is really the key factor there. I will note that even with
our share repurchase, we do have one of the stronger common dividends in the industry. So we do feel like we're
returning capital to shareholders, but I would love to buy at these prices. Also, we think the share price is a
12

fantastic buy and very attractive. The idea of buying back those shares is very attractive, but certainly for this
year, we are on pause and then we'll assess the uncertainty factor as we get into 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jim, I would add that while we have been cautious on RWA and managing down some aspects of our loan
portfolio, that's not sort of our long-term perspective, our long-term objective. We do want to grow. Again, as a
company, we see opportunities to grow really based on sort of how the economy plays out as we get into 2024.
And that's always the first place we want to use our capital is around the loan growth equation. And then
secondly, John, I think you are aware that we've done a good job over the course of the last three years or four
years of leveraging buybacks. And so we do think it's an important tool of, again, sort of balancing between the
two will be really important.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone. So want to go back to your response to Jon Arfstrom, his question where you said
NII would likely bottom in the first quarter. Maybe Jim, from a NIM view, do you see NIM following the same
trajectory, maybe stepping down in 4Q then 1Q and then we bottom there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning, Steve. Thanks for the question. I mean, as always, I'll put my disclaimer out there that we're
not doing a NIM percentage shop. The lumpiness of our commercial business model often results in a NIM
percentage that doesn't necessarily correlate with income. So one that I am always hesitant to comment on. I'll
just say in general that I do expect NIM percentage to improve as we bring down cash and purchase funds over
the next quarter. So I do think we'll see some positive traction there and I do think it's fair to in a very general way
to say if we see net interest income troughing in Q1, that's likely the trough for NIM also. So we'll continue to keep
an eye on that. But that's what I would say big picture.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then Jim, given the comments that you're fairly neutral now in terms of ALCO positioning. If rates stay
higher for longer, I know you don't like commenting on it, but I'm going to ask you anyway. Directionally speaking,
if we bottom in the first quarter, how do you think we'd trend through the year assuming no cuts, assuming the
Fed just stays really on hold? Do you think directionally NIM trends favorably through the year?

James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
That's going to depend on some of those variables that I mentioned early on. Loan growth, loan spread pricing,
those are all big factors. But I do think that if we do stay higher for longer and [ph] QT (38:57) continues, that does
have the potential to put pressure on NIM. It's not our base case. It's not what the forward curve is saying, higher
for longer. But we haven't been in this situation in a long time as an economy and an industry, so it's really hard to
say. But we will see some continued deposit pressures if we do stay higher for longer, I believe.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Steve, I do think that we have been very successful on the overall pricing side, on the lending side, obviously
taking into account sort of all relationships and doing the right thing by our customers. And so I think there's a
chance for us to offset some of that just by pricing discipline and potentially loan growth in 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. As I mentioned earlier – thanks, Curt. I mean, we do feel like we have the right to ask for the proper pricing
relative to our cost of funds. And to the extent there is less liquidity in the economy. Deposit pricing, cost of
funding goes up. I would expect to recover a piece of that or perhaps all of it in our pricing equation. But again,
we'll see what the market allows and what we can demand from it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I know one of the factors is non-interest-bearing levels, right? Which were down again this quarter. But I'm
curious, are you seeing customers still optimize and move balances out and search for higher yield? Or is it just
back to spending cash?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Steven, that's actually one of the areas of encouragement to me. I mentioned that the deposit betas are growing
moderated in recent weeks. I would also say the same is true of non-interest-bearing deposits. If I look month by
month since the disruption in the spring, the decline in non-interest-bearing deposits has slowed up every month
and it was essentially flat from August to September. I'm not saying it will always continue to be flat, but I do think
that these corporate treasurers manage their own cash levels. They're starting to hit that floor where they need a
certain amount of cash to run their businesses. And we're really seeing a slow up as a result. We think they've
squeezed that orange about as much as they can. Now, could there be a little bit more to go? Yes, it's possible.
But we do think that the trend is our friend in this case, and we're really seeing a flattening out of the non-interest-
bearing decline. So I don't see a lot of decline occurring at this point in time, probably a little bit more. But I think
we're well past the worst of it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
If I could squeeze one final one in, I hear all the comments around moderating expense growth in 2024. But if we
step out, if we look at this quarter, revenue was down 9% year over year, expenses were up 11% year over year.
We know why. But earnings are down 30%. As you guys think about the next year, are there levers to pull to start
generating more meaningful operating leverage? Or is it just a tough environment? Do you have to just wait for
14

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
the yield curve to improve and other things or do you sense, we need to do more here? And there's other levers
we could pull to get at least earnings heading in a more favorable direction? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Well, Steven, I would just say in general, as a company, we are always committed to delivering positive operating
leverage. Short term, that's a bit more challenging as you just outlined for us for all the reasons that we know. But
two things there. One, first and foremost, we are focused on top line revenue growth and we believe we've got
great momentum there with the things I outlined to you previously, whether it's product expansion and capabilities,
treasury management, capital markets, et cetera. We continue to add talent in many of our areas. We just have a
very successful lift out of a wealth management team in Southern California and the expansion into the
Southeast, but also just adding depth in the existing markets that we operate in. And I do believe that we will
continue to drive fee income and that loan growth will return for us in 2024.
We'll provide more guidance at our fourth quarter earnings call. So we're focused there on the revenue side. And
then secondly, we are going to be focused on the expenses. And we've done that historically well as a company.
And we want to be careful to strike the right balance between sort of short-term expense management and sort of
the longer-term investment in the company. So I can't promise sort of when does that sort of positive operating
leverage equation tilt, but it's our objective and we are very focused on delivering positive operating leverage for
the company and for our investors long term.

Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Sounds great. Good morning. Hey, good morning. Jim or Curt, maybe on the $100 billion coming back to that,
you're – you are about 15% below that. How are you thinking I guess within the budget for expenses like what
needs to be spent to be compliant for $100 billion? I guess what's already been spent that you could kind of
grandfather in? And then also, can you remind us on the pension expense? I think it's tied to the 10-year. And just
remind us the magnitude of how you're thinking about it? This year was a big year. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
All right, Chris. I'm going to take the beginning of that question on the $100 billion target, and I'll let Jim address
the pension issue. We obviously, with the significant buildup in deposits, we were getting closer to the $100 billion
mark, which we really never thought was maybe a sustainable situation, that we had a lot of buildup in liquidity
because of sort of stimulus and monetary policy overall. So that has pulled down as we've moderated some on
the RWA side of the equation. We are very comfortably right now below that $100 billion mark at $86 billion. And
15


Comerica, Inc.
(CMA) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
if you just look at organic growth, which has always been our focus as a company, it would take us some time, we
think, to get back over the $100 billion mark.
So it's important that we are positioned to be over a $100 billion in terms of regulatory compliance of what would
be required to be a Category IV bank. And we've had our projects and initiatives underway for some time. We're
probably 40%, 50% through sort of what would be necessary for us to comply in terms of the technology and sort
of infrastructure to support that. But we've got some time to sort of make that happen. But it is one of the
expenses that has applied some additional expense pressure for us sort of longer term. I made some comments
previously that I think at one of the investor conferences just around M&A. And just maybe just to be clear there,
nothing has changed for us in that equation. Getting close to $100 billion does not change whether we would do
M&A or not. We were focused, first and foremost, as I said earlier, on organic growth. It's just the deal came along
and we still had to make great strategic sense for us. And again, we think we can sort of manage where we are
today and we've got some time to sort of evaluate the landscape longer term. But I don't anticipate any sort of
pressure on the $100 billion level, at least for the foreseeable next couple of years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. And I might take that even a step further. Chris, you mentioned 15% below. We do plan on repaying more
debt in the fourth quarter. We'll get the full quarter effect of what we did in the third quarter. So we do see cash
and purchase funds coming down another $4 billion in the fourth quarter on average, [ph] on a lending basis
(46:49), more like probably $1 billion or $1.5 billion.
So we are well below the $100 billion. Now as AOCI comes back and we make – we have loan growth, we'll start
moving back towards $100 billion. But as Curt said, we're probably a few years away from that. And I'll just say
that in terms of what we're focused on, in terms of complying with $100 billion as it might impact expenses, we're
only focused on that subsection of the requirements that potentially take more than a couple years to make sure
you're comfortable with. So those things that have a longer tail to them, we are focused on working on and that
will be one of the expense pressures we have to offset. But we don't feel like we need to jump into it entirely in
terms of getting ready at this point in time. A lot of the requirements, we can wait until we're a little bit closer to a
$100 billion.
In terms of the pension question, pension accounting is one of our favorite topics and a great one to waddle
through. A lot of variables there. But interest rates are the key one, market performance in general, but interest
rates most specifically. If you go back to our K, we do have a sensitivity in there that shows that for every 25 bps
rate change, the 10-year is a pretty good proxy for our liability and the assets we have offsetting that. Every 25
bps translates to about $11 million of expense. So obviously, we strike that in 12/31. There's been a big step-up
since then. But I would also say there are other variables that are likely to make us come in below what that
sensitivity would suggest. Most importantly, we have a number of amortized credits from past actuarial
assumptions that we all performed on. And so we will perform that sensitivity, but a lot of variables involved there.
So that's something we'll have more clarity on as we approach the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's really helpful. Thanks, Jim. Just one final one in terms of the targeted, I guess, level of cash and bonds on
the balance sheet. You haven't reinvested the bonds in the last year. Remind us either as a percentage of earning
assets or maybe an absolute level where you could ultimately see those levels shrinking down to?

James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, that's going to depend on just the overall composition of the balance sheet, how close we are to $100
billion as it might relate to liquidity rules and debt requirements. But I would see us moving closer towards $14
billion, $15 billion securities, probably closer to $14 billion. So we have a ways to go. And what that might suggest
is we're likely not going to be buying securities at least for the next couple of years.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. I wanted to follow up on your comments on AOCI. I mean I think you noted that you haven't
added any swaps in the books this year, given that the 10-year is up another 50 basis points this quarter. How are
you thinking about managing AOCI risk here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Well, at this point, we don't feel like we have to do anything synthetically to manage it. We're okay with where
we're at based on the burn off that we see over the next couple of years. And really more importantly, the burn off
over the next five years as we potentially become a Category IV bank. And so at this point in time, we are
comfortable with where we're at. We do think that as we move closer towards Category IV, we will consider
modifying our strategies to maybe shorten the duration of the securities, whether that be with what we purchased
or doing something synthetically. But for the time being, we don't feel compelled to do anything. We're
comfortable with the burn off that we see over the next few years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. So as – there's clearly some volatility on the long end of the curve. Does it make sense to use the same
DV01 for AOCI that you saw this quarter and then apply to changes in the 10-year in future quarters to figure out
the AOCI risk there?

Manan Gosalia Q

next couple of years. How is that impacted by the rate environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Well, that 37% considers the curve as it stands today. So not just spot rates, but where the curve is. So to the
extent the entire curve shifts up or down, that will have an impact on that burn off. But for now, this obviously
contemplates the entire spectrum of the curve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And if the curve moves higher, then the pull to par will be longer. And if it moves lower, then the pull to par will be
sooner?

James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Brody. I would not go back through all that detail with you. I might just say that in general, the GEAR Up
was a combination of expenses, but also some revenue enhancement opportunities that we've focused on. Some
of that was around capability, some of it was around pricing strategies, et cetera. And it was not just a single year
impact. It was an impact that we – probably we put in place to improve overall efficiency, what was at that point a
very low rate environment.
So if you're looking at sort of applicability to – today, I mean, we're a bigger company in terms of our overall
revenue base as an organization and our expense base as well. And so we're going to think about this in a
thoughtful way on a go-forward. If you're kind of driving to sort of what expense reductions we might look at and
look at things that really minimize anything associated with revenue and customers. And really try to focus on
areas, real estate from a technology spend that we might be more careful with, vacancy rates in terms of head
count, et cetera, and we'll have more to potentially share as we get into the outlook for 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. I wanted to ask a couple of questions to Melinda. Melinda, you said – you talked
a little bit about the multi-family and the migration there, but the sponsors have kind of stepped up to cover any
shortfalls. When you say shortfalls, do you mean like they're multi-family properties that are falling below one debt
service coverage ratio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
It could be that they are in the process of being leased up and so they're behind schedule. But the biggest driver
right now in the multi-family space in terms of any kind of a shortfall is really because of the rising rate
environment. The majority of their loans are floating rate. So they've been absorbing the rate increase of 500
basis points over the last four, five quarters. And so there could be a shortfall in an interest reserve that we
require during the construction phase or a debt service coverage during the lease up phase as those are going
into stabilization.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And are there any markets that you look at across your footprint and say maybe there's new supply coming
on that might exacerbate any of these issues, like any of that come to mind in particular?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I think the market where we've seen the most challenged and the most migration, again, reminders now
that the migration has been very manageable and criticized loans in the commercial real estate book are still
relatively low. But the migration is really concentrated in the California. Some of the sub markets, Northern
California being the most impacted at this point and then Southern California. So we're watching those really,
really closely. And again, the customer base there and sponsor base, I would consider exceptionally strong. And
we have tenured colleagues that know how to manage through this. So we feel really good about our strategy
there. We feel really good about the product set. But multi-family has had a tremendous amount of supply come
to market and there's more to come. So I expect that we'll continue to see some modest level of migration in that
portfolio.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A

forward starting coming on that'll outpace anything that's maturing. That's all reflected in the 2024 kind of lock up
on the swaps book that...

James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Absolutely. It is...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. I just wanted to make sure. And then just last one for you. For – I know it's a smaller portion of the
book, but for the true fixed portion, not the swapped floating portion. Can you walk us through what the maturity
schedule looks like over the next 12 months, and kind of what the – what the yields are that are rolling off versus
what current originations those are are right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. It's really a relatively small part of our book, and I don't see it having a big impact on yields next year. I think
somewhere in the appendix, you would surmise fixed rate loans, organically speaking, are about 8% of our book,
and they have pretty long maturities to 12 years on average. So you don't see a lot come up for repricing every
year. We might see $300 million come up this – in 2024 to use a kind of an average and they are priced below our
current loan yields. So there is some opportunity there, but I wouldn't see fixed rate repricing having more than a
couple of bps of impact on our loan yields next year. There is a little bit – there is a bit of favorable impact.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Do you have any security maturities that are lumpy and lower yielding at any point in the next 12 months?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
We have our normal, what I'll consider to be smooth roll off of MBSs. And we do have some treasuries ensuring
over the next 15 months. But I would say those aren't necessarily lumpy. We see a little bit in most quarters. So
we obviously are going to benefit in 2024 from securities maturing as we redeploy that either into cash earning
much higher yields or avoid purchase funds. So net net, we will see a benefit from fixed asset repricing next year,

tiny bit from loans. You'll certainly get a nice lift up from securities. Fixed rate swaps actually go the other
direction, but the net benefit will be favorable in 2024.

Good morning, Ken.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi, thanks. Good morning. I want to ask a question on the loan book and on the business line basis. You're not
under any kind of like dieting, so to speak. But after you got out of Mortgage Banker this year, just – there's a
couple of these lines that are getting a little smaller over time, like tech and life sciences and equity fund. Just
wanted to ask like how much of that is environmental? And do you envision taking a harder look at any of the loan
categories that you have in terms of what you're thinking about in terms of future growth opportunities?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Hey, Ken. This is Peter. Yeah. We've got some of our businesses that have kind of continued to drift down this
quarter. And quite candidly, probably well into the fourth quarter and maybe even in the first quarter. But we don't
really see any additional changes to the lines of business that we're in. We do feel really good about the portfolio
on a go-forward basis. I do think that in the environment with increased expectations around profitability and
pricing, and I'm just sort of managing our balance sheet. Some businesses are impacted more than others. But as
we get into next year, we'll try to give a little more guidance on what we think loan outlook looks like for 2024. But
I suspect a few of these businesses that you've kind of seen creep down here as of late, probably be another
quarter or two before we start to go the other direction. Overall, with our general portfolio, Middle Market,
business banking, small business, our pipelines there are still pretty good relatively. It depends on the geography
a little bit. And we're trying to add customers and add new business in that space as we get into the end of the
year and into next.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Great. Thanks. And my follow-up is just on the expenses. Can you just explain like the kind of the write
back on the modernization this quarter? How does that mechanically work? And then just making sure that I
understand that the fourth quarter guide is built on the all in 3Q number? Thank you.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Ken. The modernization expenses were actually a net credit because of the real estate gain that you saw in
the third quarter that we noted on the expense slides. That was the offset by some expenses, but modernization
expenses were in that negative $14 million or $14 million credit for the quarter. We would expect that to be a little
closer to zero for the fourth quarter. We may have an additional real estate sale that could give us something in
the low single digits of millions. But overall, I don't expect modernization to be a big driver of fourth quarter
expenses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. Right. So that – okay. And then the fourth quarter guide is built on the – aside from the deferred
comp that you don't expect to repeat, the fourth quarter expense guide is built off of the [ph] $555 million
(01:01:44)?

incremental growth?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Brandon, it's Jim. I'll start off and Peter may want to chime in here. But we've been very focused on stabilizing the
funding base and the liquidity base in recent months, as you know. We got a lot of success there. We're actually
in better shape than we actually thought we would be back in the spring with the loan to deposit ratio of 80%. I
think it was right now it's been a period of recalibration. We're focused on getting the right mix of customers, right
mix of businesses, getting the right pricing. And then we expect this to be at some point, 2024, to be at a point
where we start growing loans at a more normal pace again. We're not quite there yet, but we expect to be there at
some point in 2024 with loan growth. But right now, we're still going through that period of recalibration, whether it
be getting more certainty around our deposit base, getting the right mix in terms of business lines. But we do
anticipate some type of balance sheet growth at some point in 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Brandon. I might just add to what Jim said. I mean, we're also seeing a lot of, I would say caution in our
customer base. There's a lot of headline risk I think you might see as we go into next year. And Melinda has
talked a lot about credit, but we're prepared that it could be a tougher economic environment and we'll just
navigate successfully. We always have as a company really well. So what that looks like for loan demand per se
is probably to be determined. I mean, we'll give some more guidance, as we've mentioned, on loans when we get
into the fourth quarter call for next year. But we do think we'll get back to loan growth next year. I think we just
don't know necessarily what that looks like just yet with the environment, with interest rates, where they are. And
to the extent that we enter a more challenging economic environment, we'll have to navigate that. And again, it
also depends on business by business, what that may look like in geography by geography.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got it. Got it. And then could you speak to deposit seasonality flows? What are your kind of expectations near
term? And just how close you think we are to maybe a normal seasonality trends?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Brandon. Seasonality has really been a tough one in the last couple of years. The typical seasonal trends
that we see amongst different business units, whether it be loans or deposits, it's kind of gone out the window. So
we're waiting to see whether or not those return back to normal seasonality patterns. We're in a higher interest
rate environment and to what extent, a different liquidity environment too in terms of overall liquidity in the
economy. So it remains to be seen if we do return back to those typical patterns that we've seen in the past. As I
mentioned, we may have a very small bit of seasonality assumed in our outlook, but not a lot. So we do see some
potential for upside there. But frankly, it just feels like deposit seasonality, much like many other patterns, remains
to be seen in this new paradigm as to whether or not we return back to the old normal or not.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.

Good morning, Peter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Hi. Good morning. Just going back to the 2024 expense outlook, does that already contemplate some expenses
initiatives? Or as you go through the budgeting process, though, there's opportunities for maybe some additional
expenses versus bank guidance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Peter, it's a bit of both. We haven't been sitting on our hands, so to speak, and have been looking at opportunities
to slow expense growth and to be more prudent. We have some other things that are still in process if you think
[ph] of us for the (01:06:09) planning process for 2024. So we'll, again, have more to share potentially as we get
into the fourth quarter earnings call.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And then just one housekeeping. Just what was the end of period balance on Mortgage Banker loans? Just
curious how much is left to runoff.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Mortgage Banker, I mean, for the quarter, we were at $900 million a little bit lower than that for ending, I
don't know...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
And I think period end was around $650 million (01:06:46).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. So...

So but, we'll – what we've communicated there Peter is that we expect the balances to be pretty minimal by the
end of the year. Period end might be a couple of hundred million.
