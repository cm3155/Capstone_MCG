Q4 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2022
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today to review fourth quarter and
full year 2021 results. I'll begin on slide number 5. Ally generated outstanding results in 2021. I'm incredibly proud
of the efforts and dedication of our more than 10,000 teammates who delivered yet another year of innovation and
focused execution.
Over the past few years, we've experienced a profound shift in consumer demand and expectations for seamless,
digital-first banking products in response to COVID-related challenges and advancements in technology. Ally has
leveraged these broad-based secular trends to strengthen our position as a disruptive growth company, guided by
a winning formula to do it right for our customers, employees, and communities.
Full year adjusted EPS of $8.61, core ROTC of 24.3%, and revenues of $8.4 billion represented record-setting
results and evidence of the leading Auto, Insurance, and digital bank platforms we built. Momentum generated
across our businesses positions us well to continue unlocking franchise value in the years ahead. Our recent
acquisition of Fair Square, the latest digital-first capability we've added to our product suite, will further enhance
our trajectory. We closed the transaction in December, ahead of schedule, and are well underway with the
integration.
Looking at Auto results, our dealer network expanded for the 12th straight year in 2021, generating $46.3 billion of
originations, our highest level since the early 2000, sourced from a record 13 million decision applications. This
was our fourth consecutive year of origination yields above 7%, demonstrating our strong competitive position,
disciplined underwriting, and leading dealer and customer service capabilities.
Credit losses remain benign with 31 basis points of full year retail Auto net charge-offs. Our leadership position
within the Auto ecosystem is clear across these metrics, affirming the strength of our team and the success of our
multi-pronged strategy to broaden the dealer network, and generate solid volumes and accretive risk-adjusted
returns.
The strength and agility of our business model in a wide variety of operating environments is evident in our
performance over the past two years, as we've successfully responded to strong consumer demand, high used
vehicle values, and reduced inventories. We've earned our market-leading position by driving customer value over
the long-term, and we remain focused on achieving continued success as we navigate change in the years
ahead.
Across our consumer and commercial portfolios, credit remains very strong, supported by robust job prospects,
ongoing wage expansion, and the strongest customer balance sheets observed in decades, all of which help
mitigate inflationary dynamics. While the pace of credit normalization remains up for debate, we've taken a
balanced approach in our reserve process under a view that normalization will occur gradually over the next two
years.
We proactively enhanced the use of advanced data, automation, and digital tools, increasing customer
engagement and strengthening our ability to mitigate losses. Between 40% and 70% of our Auto customer
interactions occur digitally each month, increasing speed and effectiveness, while creating a strong customer
experience.
Within Insurance, our compelling value proposition for dealers and consumers is evident in written premium
volume of $1.2 billion for 2021, as we expanded dealers and customers. Our investment portfolio grew to $6.5

billion, the highest level since becoming a publicly-traded company, reflecting years of steady written policy
growth.
Turning to Ally Bank, growth accelerated again this year, aligned with the increasing momentum toward a digital-
first world. As the leading all-digital and customer-centric bank, we've established a scalable platform,
differentiated by the personalized, seamless, modern banking products we're delivering. We generated our 13th
consecutive year of customer and balanced growth, as our customer base expanded 10%, while total deposits
grew to 89% of funding.
Within our digital-first consumer offerings, Ally Home originations of $10.4 billion were more than double the prior-
year level. Ally Invest customer assets exceeded $17 billion, as self-directed and robo accounts grew to 506,000.
Ally Lending volume of $1.2 billion more than doubled and was powered by a 37% increase in merchant
relationships across our healthcare and home improvement verticals. Fair Square balances closed the year at
$953 million, an increase of 25% since announcing the acquisition in October, and 66% year-over-year; reflecting
strong customer acquisition, consumer spending trends, and the scalability of the Fair Square approach.
And within Corporate Finance, HFI balances of $7.8 billion grew nearly 30% year-over-year through a
combination of increased new loans and normalizing drawdown activity among our clients. The CF portfolio,
including unfunded commitments, now stands at $12.7 billion, which highlights the success we've had in growing
this business. As a result of our strong financial position, we were pleased to recently announce a $2 billion
buyback authorization program for full year 2022, and a 20% dividend increase to $0.30 per share.
As we turn to slide number 6, I'll reiterate the view I've shared on many occasions regarding the link between
values and results. I'm confident our record-setting performance and ongoing momentum are directly tied to the
clear focus and prioritization of our customers, employees, and communities. Maintaining an authentic and
inclusive culture has been a top priority for me during my tenure as CEO, Ally took several actions over the past
year aligned with our do it right approach.
For our customers, we've actively enhanced products, interfaces, and service capabilities, utilizing advanced tech
and data innovations, which Jenn will provide more detail on. We took the key step of adding a credit card product
to our suite of digital-first offerings, and we're proud to lead the industry in eliminating overdraft fees, leading to
Bank On National Account certification from the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund.
For our Ally teammates, we increased Ally's minimum wage to $20 per hour, while we announced the third annual
grant of company stock to all employees; and expanded health and family benefit programs. We were honored to
be named among the best places to work at Forbes, DiversityInc, and numerous other publications; and received
another perfect Corporate Equality score from Human Rights Campaign.
Over 40% of our workforce voluntarily participates in one of our employee resource groups, a key element of how
we're driving a stronger sense of belonging and engagement across our teams. Our deliberate actions to treat
people as people and create an inclusive workplace have the added benefit of acting as a powerful retention tool.
Within our communities, we marked our 10th year of the employee-led Giving Back campaign, donating 24,000
hours of time to worthy causes. We hosted our third annual Moguls in the Making student competition in
partnership with several HBCUs; and marked the first full year for the Ally Charitable Foundation actions, donating
$15 million of combined employee and company contributions to community, social, and educational causes.

On the ESG front, we announced Ally achieved carbon neutrality and officially established an environmental
sustainability office. Taken in isolation, any one of these actions would represent a significant milestone; but when
taken together, these actions provide clear evidence of what can be achieved when purpose, creativity, and
dedication come together under a shared vision.
Moving to slide number 7, I wanted to spend a few moments summarizing the strategic evolution we've delivered
before handing it over to Jenn to walk through the details.
Over the years, we've built resilient platforms through constant expansion and evolution of our customer-centric
offerings. We challenge ourselves each day to look around corners and embrace disruptive forces on behalf of
our clients and customers to proactively manage risks and deliver financial solutions that anticipate their needs in
a seamless, differentiated manner.
While performance was exceptional in 2021, the opportunities we've built for growth in 2022 and beyond are what
I'm most excited about, including continued momentum across our leading customer-centric businesses,
delivering diversified and durable earnings, and disciplined capital management. These priorities have positioned
us to deliver long-term growth and sustained higher returns, as seen in our track record of delivering or exceeding
the financial guidance we've provided over the past several years.
We continue to focus on deepening customer relationships through digital capabilities that combine leading,
award-winning products with integrated, stable, and secure bank platforms. We've got a really powerful model and
considerable financial strengths. The future is bright and you can be assured we will keep delivering.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jenn to provide perspectives on our progress and review our detailed financial
results.

Jennifer A. LaClair
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, JB, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by expressing my gratitude for our dedicated Ally
workforce who powered our growing momentum over the past several years and drove exceptional results in
2021. Before diving into the fourth quarter details, I'll review Ally's multi-year strategic and financial
transformation, including the drivers behind our steady execution and strong performance.
Beginning on slide 8, we've included a view of our comprehensive and expanded product suite, reflecting the
many capabilities we've added since 2014. We provide a broad range of integrated and sophisticated offerings
built for and around our consumer and commercial clients.
Turning to slide 9, we're constantly evolving and adapting our capabilities, innovating through tech and data-
driven approaches. With each new product launch, redesign, or enhancement, we apply our deeply rooted
expertise and disruptive DNA to create unique, safe, and innovative solutions for a broad range of financing and
banking needs.
Our customer-centric approach focus on delivering compelling value, fuels growth, creates opportunities for
relationship deepening, and diversifies Ally's balance sheet and earnings. Ally's compelling growth trajectory and
the customer-oriented awards we've amassed over the years serve as a testament to the effectiveness of our
approach.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2022
Turning to slide 10, customers using an Ally product now stands at 10.5 million across our platforms, expanding
52% since 2014. Ally Bank customers have more than quadrupled over this timeframe as we've evolved our
capabilities and successfully expanded multi-product relationships shown on the bottom left. In Auto, we've added
nearly 5,500 dealers as part of our multi-year effort to broaden the funnel and increase dealer engagement. This
strategy has culminated in a 40-plus percent increase in application volume, driving strong originations and risk-
adjusted returns. Robust product expansion and customer growth have translated to improved balance sheet and
earnings, covered over the next few pages.
Turning to slide 11, our balance sheet transformation reflects two key dynamics. First, the diversification of our
asset base, which has grown by $31 billion, or 20%, since 2014. Over this timeframe, we've generated $23 billion
or a fivefold increase in Ally Bank consumer and commercial product balances; $13 billion of consumer Auto
balances helping to mitigate the pandemic-driven floor plan decline; and nearly $14 billion in accretive, capital-
efficient investment security.
The second driver of our optimization can be found within net interest margin, shown on the bottom of the page,
where disciplined asset pricing, deposit growth, and active liability management have increased asset yields and
improved funding costs. Auto pricing has remained above 7% for four consecutive years, while floating rate
commercial and unsecured products are positioned for further growth and accretion as rates rise.
On the funding side, we've more than doubled stable, sticky deposits since 2014, while retiring $24 billion of
legacy unsecured debt with a weighted average coupon of over 5%. These actions drove structurally lower
funding costs throughout the prevailing low rate environment and enhanced our ability to control liability costs.
In the years ahead, we expect our balance sheet to drive an upper 3% margin as assets steadily migrate towards
$200 billion. Structural enhancements across both side of our balance sheet drove strong performance over the
past two years, and position us well for a variety of rate and economic environment moving forward.
Turning to slide 12, Ally's core PPNR has more than doubled since 2014, generating nearly $4.3 billion in 2021,
our highest level. Our outlook for annual PPNR expansion will be revenue driven as we continue to prudently
invest in customer capabilities, technology, talent, and brand. In the bottom left, total revenues of $8.4 billion
represented record-setting net financing revenue and other revenue, reflecting diversified sources of income and
our ability to capture tailwinds in real time. In the bottom right, Ally's adjusted efficiency ratio which, as a reminder,
excludes Insurance, reached the lowest level since becoming a publicly-traded company, as we remain diligent in
investment and expense management.
Moving to slide 13, our disciplined and rigorous risk management approach has driven consistently strong credit
outcome. Consolidated net charge-offs have remained below 1%, while retail Auto losses have outperformed our
1.4% to 1.6% guidance in six of the seven past years. These trends reflect the high quality, high utility of our loan
and lease products; consistent, disciplined underwriting capabilities; modernized collection and servicing
practices; and, more recently, tailwinds associated with stimulus and historically strong collateral values.
As JB mentioned earlier, we expect credit to steadily normalize through 2023, which our reserve levels
accommodate. Risk management is a key pillar within our strategic plan as we apply deep experience, extensive
data, and sophisticated approaches in our assessment, pricing, and servicing across our balance sheet.
Turning to slide 14, our diligent focus on accretive capital deployment is reflected in our expanding returns and
over a 70% increase in tangible book value per share. Our capital strategy remains focused on long-term value

creation, evident in our robust growth trajectory, both organic and inorganic, as we've executed opportunistic tuck-
in acquisitions to augment capabilities.
This disciplined approach has resulted in $16 billion of RWA expansion, even while we've returned $6.5 billion in
excess capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Current CET1 levels remain well-above our
internal and regulatory targets, a testament to our approach and the strength of our position moving forward.
Now, let's turn to slide 15 to review detailed results for the quarter. Net financing revenue, excluding OID, of $1.66
billion, grew 27% year-over-year, representing our highest quarterly results. Adjusted other revenue of $533
million reflected solid investment gains and growing momentum across our diversified product offering. Provision
expense of $210 million included the day one reserve build of $97 million associated with closing Fair Square and
the seasonal rise in NCOs, even as loss frequency and severity trends demonstrate continued strength.
Noninterest expense of $1.1 billion was driven by actions highlighted over the past, including variable costs
across our businesses from customer and revenue growth; investments in our brand, security, and tech
capabilities; and purposeful investment in our workforce and benefits, allowing us to drive employee engagement
in the top 10% of all companies, a critical advantage for us as we navigate competitive labor market. GAAP and
adjusted EPS for the quarter were $1.79 and $2.02, respectively, both of which include $0.09 related to a state-
specific tax item and one month of Fair Square results.
Moving to slide 16; net interest margin, excluding OID, was 3.82%, 90 basis points higher than prior year and our
sixth consecutive quarter of expansion. Earning asset yield of 4.75% grew quarter-over-quarter as we redeployed
low-earning cash into higher yielding loans and investment securities. Average earning assets grew to $172.9
billion, and imbalances increased by over $6 billion, representing our strongest linked-quarter growth in over five
years, with all loan balances increasing.
Turning to liabilities; cost of funds improved 8 basis points, the 10th consecutive linked-quarter decline. Ally
continues to remain well-positioned for a variety of rate environment, as we've cultivated strong customer loyalty
and engagement through our expanded suite of digitally-based products. We've strengthened pricing and beta on
both sides of the balance sheet, and tactically utilized hedging strategies to bolster our overall asset sensitivity
and NIM position.
Turning to slide 17, CET1 of 10.3% reflected risk-weighted asset growth, including $3.5 billion of floor plan
balance increases and the impact of closing Fair Square, which taken together represented 75 basis points of
capital consumption. Despite these impacts, CET1 remains $1.9 billion above our internal target. We recently
announced our second consecutive $2 billion buyback authorization and a 20% increase in our common dividend
to $0.30 per share.
Since the inception of our capital program in 2016, we've reduced shares outstanding by 30% while increasing
our dividend 7 times. The quality of our capital position has improved as we've leveraged our investment-grade
rating and proactive liability management to bolster liquidity, funding, and our financial profile.
On slide 18, asset quality remained strong throughout Q4 as consumer and commercial losses remained
historically low. In the upper left, consolidated net charge-offs of 35 basis points were nearly half prior year and
60% below 2019. Retail Auto trends, shown on the bottom, reflected solid customer payment trends and improved
loss given default rates, supported by strong collateral values. Early and late-stage delinquency trends reflected
seasonal activity, remaining well below prior year and 2019 levels, an encouraging signal heading into 2022.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2022
On slide 19, consolidated coverage of 2.67% reflected growth across our retail Auto, point-of-sale, and mortgage
portfolios, plus the addition of reserves for Fair Square. Retail Auto coverage at 3.54% moved lower quarter-over-
quarter by 8 basis points, as trends continued to improve across consumer health and macroeconomic measures.
Blue chip forecasts indicate unemployment levels will remain at approximately 4%. As a reminder, under our
CECL reserve approach, we incorporate this outlook for full employment into our 12-month reasonable and
supportable period before migrating to the historic mean of 6.5% by month 36. This methodology reflects the
prudent approach we've adopted under CECL to manage uncertainty, minimize volatility, and maximize
transparency.
Turning to slide 20, retail deposits ended at $134.7 billion. Q4 increased $3.1 billion, representing our sixth
straight year of growth at or above $10 billion. New and existing customers continue to drive our performance,
reflecting our compelling products and their desire to keep their money and grow their balances with us.
We generated our 51st consecutive quarter of customer growth, adding 226,000 in 2021 while retention remains
industry-leading at 96%, as we launched our largest brand campaign to-date during Q4. On the bottom right,
customer demographics show the compelling opportunity we have to deepen relationships, as nearly 70% of new
customers are from younger generation, early in their financial journey, and with a high propensity for digital
engagement.
Turning to slide 21, our expanded product suite positions us for ongoing growth. We've generated six years of
multi-product relationship deepening that continues to accelerate across all products. We've leveraged our large
and growing depositors to build scale within each of these offerings, and we've seen a steady increase in growth
from customers who are new to Ally altogether. These trends reinforce the momentum of our brand, and the
relevance and quality of our diversified digital platform.
Moving to slide 22, Auto segment pre-tax income of $839 million reflects our adaptable, leading business model.
Revenue growth reflects the multi-year optimization of consumer and commercial lending strategies, in addition to
tailwinds from strong credit and elevated used car values. We included retail portfolio trends in the bottom left,
where origination yields remained above 7% again in 2021, which we expect to continue as we generate over $40
billion of volume annually moving forward.
On the bottom right, lease activities reflects the impact of record used car values, and elevated lessee and dealer
buyout activity which tempered realized gains in 2021. Within our financial outlook, we assume steady
normalization of these trends, providing us yet another opportunity to demonstrate our ability to effectively
navigate changes within the Auto ecosystem.
Within our financial outlook for revenues and credit, we've embedded an assumption for used values to decline by
15% to 20% cumulatively by the end of 2023 even as recent trends indicate ongoing resilience. Execution within
Auto reflects our diversified, full spectrum capabilities, expanded market reach, experienced underwriting, and
increased use of technology.
Turning to slide 23, our agile, adaptable platform enables us to source strong volume across a variety of
environment. In the upper left, we generated $46 billion of origination volume in 2021, sourced from our network
of over 21,000 dealers. And in consumer, assets expanded to $89 billion, shown in the upper right, reflecting retail
and lease portfolio growth; while ending commercial balances grew for the first time in five quarters, ending at $16
billion. This was driven by a 15% rebound in industry inventories, a modest but positive trend occurring ahead of

our expectation for growth later this year. Q4 Auto originations of $10.9 billion represented our highest fourth
quarter since 2004, while we've maintained a disciplined underwriting approach.
Turning to our Insurance segment on slide 24; core pre-tax income of $67 million reflected investment gain
activity, modestly below prior quarter results, but well above historic levels. In the bottom left, the $6.5 billion
investment portfolio continues to add revenue-generating capabilities, enhancing segment and consolidated
returns. Total written premiums of $268 million resulted in $1.2 billion of full year written premiums, our fourth
consecutive year above $1 billion. Overall, we are pleased with the resilient, countercyclic value of our Insurance
business, and remain focused on more fully leveraging our large dealer network for future growth.
Moving to slide 25, Corporate Finance core income of $75 million reflected revenue growth from meaningful year-
over-year asset growth, strong investment and syndication income, and solid credit trends. HFI balances ended at
$7.8 billion, the highest level on record for Ally; while unfunded commitments of $4.9 billion position us for
ongoing expansion. Our portfolio is comprised of high-quality, diversified loans built through steady, deliberate
execution across our experienced team. We remain confident in the continued disciplined growth of this business
moving forward.
Mortgage details are on slide 26, where pre-tax income remains relatively stable during the quarter, as asset
growth helped to mitigate normalizing gain on sale margins and persistently elevated prepayment trends. Ally
Home originated $2.9 billion in direct-to-consumer volume in Q4, exceeding $10 billion for our full year 2021, well
ahead of schedule. Having steadily grown our national reach over the past two years, we've improved our
opportunity to generate strong volume as we prioritize attractive returns.
A wrap up on slide 27 with our financial outlook. We've consistently demonstrated earnings expansion and
improved returns through several years of execution. Our clear vision, priorities, and strategy have positioned Ally
to continue generating meaningful and sustained value in the years ahead. We expect ROTCE of 16% to 18%-
plus over the medium-term, defined as the next two to three years and beyond, as we further leverage our leading
businesses and high-quality balance sheets to drive financial performance.
Notably, while our return targets do not depend on uniquely strong macroeconomic trends or pockets of transitory
dynamics, we will remain opportunistic, capturing upside beyond these ranges. Results will be fueled by revenue-
driven PPNR expansion, derived from an upper 3% NIM profile and diversified revenue generation among our
established and broadened consumer offerings. We've included several of the key variables and assumptions
embedded within our forecast, including benchmark interest rates, credit expectations, and used vehicle value
trends.
Based on the balanced approach we've taken in our outlook and the strong momentum across all our businesses,
I am confident in our ability to consistently generate profitable growth, enhance book value, and sustained returns.
And with that, I'll turn it back to JB.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So, JB, you outlined in the slides 16- to 18-plus percent returns in 2022 and the medium-term, I think, Jenn said
two to three years and beyond. And I wanted to maybe focus on the plus. So, can you maybe just talk about some
of the assumptions that are underlying, maybe give us a little bit more color? And maybe what are some of the
sources of upside that we could see over the next one to two years that are not baked into the 16% to 18%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Sure. Jenn, you want to take it or – I mean, a few I'll start with, Ryan, and then Jenn can go through the details.
Obviously, I mean, you'd look at our levels of reserves relative to the levels of loss expectations, and I think our
guidance on credit, I think you see we've taken a very pragmatic and gradual normalization to credit, but that
would be certainly a big one.
And then obviously, used car prices, I think as Jenn has guided, we see them within our financial plan as
moderating. But I think if you look at current trends, you look at the environment, I mean, used car prices are still
really strong. And as Jenn pointed out, we are seeing some very modest uptick in inventory levels. But our
outlook, I think, this year is a really robust used car market. So I mean, those were a couple. Jenn's obviously got
all the details behind it, but we feel really good about the outlook.

Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. JB, I think you nailed it. The only thing I would add is just around gains in our Insurance portfolio. We've
been able to optimize our equity market activity and drive outsized gains. And so that potentially, Ryan, could be
another area of upside. But I think you're asking the right question. I think there's an asymmetric bias here
towards outperforming the 16- to 18-plus percent and it's [indiscernible] (00:37:20), it's reserves, it's used vehicle
pricing that JB hit on, plus our ability to generate gains.

Got it. And, Jenn, if I could just dig into the expectations for the upper 3% net interest margin, can you may just
flesh out some of the assumptions that are underlying this in terms of your assumptions on rates, your ability to
drive price in the loan book? And I guess more importantly, what are the expectations over that timeframe for
deposit betas, just given you guys have obviously done a great job building the liquidity on the balance sheet?
And I'm wondering can we end up seeing you exceed prior cycles just given all the work that you guys have done
on the deposit side? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. I'll start first on the yields and then go to liabilities. But on asset yields, 90-plus percent of our retail
Auto portfolio was originated at 7-plus percent yields. And so, we are expecting, Ryan, just to continue to see
retail Auto yields continue to migrate up towards that 7-plus percent. And then if rates continue to, say, increase
as we're expecting, that could potentially go even higher.
We also have floating rate assets as we're growing floor plan. JB mentioned we're starting to see some increases
in floor plan. Those are floating rate assets. They would migrate higher as rates increase. We've increased our
asset sensitivity just through pay fixed hedging activity kind of maxed out our hedging, which will also give us
some tailwind. So net-net, when we wrap this all up, plus Fair Square, Ally Lending, we see a really robust
trajectory ahead on asset yields, in particular, if we see rising rates.
And then on the liability side, both mix and deposits will help us. We have a much healthier liability stack, having
run-off expensive, high cost, unsecured debt. Our deposit levels are 89% of funding. And then when you look at
the value we're providing to our customers based on products, our digital platform, and the fact that we're core
funded now, we do think, Ryan, to your question specifically around deposit pricing, that overall rate paid will be
lower in this next rising rate cycle.
So, you wrap it all up in the first couple of pages, the transformation we've led, the product capability expansion in
the asset side, the transformation of our funding profile, it positions us so well to hit that upper 3% NIM
irrespective of the rate environment; and, to your question, gives us opportunity to outperform as well.

Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Can you discuss the trajectory that you're expecting for NIM, particularly in light of changes in Fed funds and all
the moving parts? The guidance on the slide is super helpful, but maybe just a little bit of color and direction.
Should we be expecting 2023 NIM to be normalizing higher or lower versus 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. And, Bill, I'll jump in here. And we've been guiding towards NIM expansion now for years. So, if you
take a step back, this has been a guide irrespective of the rate trajectory, and it's all the things I just described to
Ryan around the transformation of our asset side in balance sheet, as well as our liability stack. And so, Bill, we
are expecting NIM to expand irrespective of rate.
That said, in a rising rate environment, we do think that there's an accelerated opportunity to expand earning
asset yields. Just walked through some of the drivers there around floating rate assets; growing floor plan at the
right time, adding short duration asset-sensitive assets like Ally Lending and Fair Square. That will all give us
growing momentum in a rising rate environment to continue to see earning asset yield expansion.
And then on the liability side, the healthier stack we have, plus the fact that we're so well positioned from
customer brand engagement, digital capabilities, we do think that we'll be able to hold funding costs much better
in this rate environment – rising rate environment than the last one. And so, that'll fuel that trajectory into 2022
and allow us to sustain it into 2023 beyond. So, that's some of the dynamics there, Bill, and hopefully that helps to
answer your question.

This is not a rate-driven NIM expansion; this is all about structural improvements and transformation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. That's helpful. And then separately as a follow-up, can you speak to the trajectory of the reserve rate and
how you're thinking about growth dynamics as you grow the card business? The fact that you're starting off the
year above your day one level should help dampen those headwinds. And then sort of tacking onto that, as the
card business grows given sort of that's a higher loss content business, should there be some expectation that at
some point you would raise your target capital expectations? If you could just touch on that. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. And on the overall reserve, it's largely driven by retail Auto. So, let me start there and I'll go to some
of the smaller portfolios. But retail Auto right now is at 3.54%, day one was at 3.34%. So, we're running at 20
basis points ahead of day one. And I think that, to JB's point in his prepared remarks, really helps us to manage
through any kind of economic cycle that we could see ahead. But if you look at the path of normalization in our
path history, we would expect over time as NCOs normalize that, that rate would come down from the 3.54%,
somewhere closer to that 3.34%. So I think if anything, Bill, that gives us some tailwinds heading into 2022 and
2023.
And then on some of the newer products that will have higher coverage levels, I think we're very well reserved
there. Fair Square, we just put on at a 12% coverage ratio. Ally Lending is close to that. So I think we're just in a
really good spot there. Not going to drive upside but we'll be growing that, and the mix may change, a slightly
higher consolidated level. But if you wrap it all up with retail Auto being as big as it is with as high a reserve
coverage level from a consolidated perspective, that should come down over time.
And then on our capital target, look, we feel that we are very well positioned. We are adding some new portfolios
with Fair Square and Ally Lending. But they're about $2 billion today, and we'll grow this 2% to 4% from here, but
it's not a big enough percent of our portfolio to really revisit the 9% target. And then also keep in mind, we're
holding 9% against a floor plan balance that is relatively risk-free. So we feel really good, Bill, about our 9% CET1
target.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
A couple of questions here. First, as we're thinking about the Fair Square integration getting behind you, can you
give us a sense as to the timing and the size that you're going to be thinking about in terms of expanding that
portfolio, and what the levers are to affecting that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. So, we're at about $950 million in balances today, and we see a path medium-term the $2 billion to $3
billion, Betsy. And I think if anything, they've shown an ability to really accelerate both customer growth and
balance sheet growth. Both are up over 60% year-over-year, and the balances are running 25% ahead of just the
projections that we shared with you in October. So, they're seeing a really robust growth trajectory. We're right
now seeing kind of a path to $2 billion, $3 billion, but we'll continue to monitor and take it from there.
[indiscernible] (00:46:10)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I mean, that's obviously a – sorry, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, it's just very compelling customer segment and product focus that is allowing them to continue to
grow. And I would just point out that they grew during one of the toughest credit card market in history as we
navigated COVID.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So, that piece of the portfolio expanding clearly net positive to NIM, floor plan is a little bit of a lower NIM
contributor. And I know in the past you've talked about funding that via securities to help keep the NIM moving
higher. How much room is there in that piece of securities shift into floor plan? And I'm asking the question from a
context of your guide for upper 3% NIM. What keeps you from seeing that guide move into low-4s as these piece
parts are coming through here?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2022
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. And, Betsy, we obviously have upside from floor plan and it's on a couple different dimensions; one is
just the floating rate assets. So, as short-term rates increase, that will naturally migrate the yield up. And, second,
to your point on funding, we're reallocating cash into floor plan. So, that gives us another tailwind from a mix
perspective. And as I mentioned earlier in response to Ryan's question, there's a lot of opportunity for earning
asset yield to continue to migrate higher, plus the fact that we think we're very well positioned to manage liability
costs down. So, there is an opportunity to go to that 4-plus percent. It's just we try to provide balanced guidance
as we look forward, but certainly there's upside opportunity there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then separately on the outlook here for used car values, which does feed into a couple of parts of the income
statement. How should we think about what you've got here, the modeling, 15%-plus decline by year-end 2023?
Like, is that – how did you get to that assessment in the guide, and what kind of pace are you thinking about that
coming through the model?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. And let me hit on model and then reality. We've modeled eight straight-line reduction from 2021 to
2023, down 15% to 20%. I think if we look at pace of used vehicle value, that continues to increase. And so, the
reality is, there's probably upside to that. But, again, we're trying to give you kind of a run rate view of returns, and
we'll be opportunistic around upside as we were certainly in 2021 here. But the model just assumes kind of
straight-line reduction there.
And then another factor I'd call your attention to because there's so much focus on used vehicle values. As we
exited 2021, the lessee buyout and the dealer buyout was increasing to 60%, 70%, 80%. And so, that's muted our
ability to harvest gains, and it lowers the year-over-year comp as we head into 2022. So, just keep that in mind.
It's not quite as big a fallout as I think some folks are modeling at this point in time.
And then the last thing I'd say on used vehicle values is we do have natural hedges just as we had a hedge with
floor plan coming down, used vehicle values going up and impacting lease yields positively. We have the hedge
on the reverse, right. So as lease yields come down, we'll see floor plan growing and you get all the great
dynamics around putting cash to work, floating rate asset increasing. So, just keep that in mind that there's
positive hedges as these vehicle values come down just like there was if they went up.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks very much. You've alluded to this in the opening comments, but you've got kind of better loan
growth that you've had in a while. You've got reasonable growth in retail Auto and then kind of growth across the
portfolios. Could you talk about how that is likely to trend over the next year or two? And then, I've got a follow-up.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, Moshe. And I mentioned assets getting to $200 billion in our medium-term, and that's driven by all the
portfolios you just mentioned. I mean, in retail Auto, we were originating at mid-$30 billion. We hit $46.3 billion this
year. We're guiding towards low $40 billion. And so, as we continue to see opportunities to originate at a higher
level, that will obviously take our retail portfolio higher.
Also seeing strong growth in lease as well. Floor plan's obviously come back. We saw it kind of trough in
September and steady growth from there. And I think it'll be a little choppy from here on out. We'll see; but
definitely opportunities in floor plan to come back. And then, the unsecured capabilities that we've recently added
with Ally Lending, with Fair Square, each of those portfolios could get to $2 billion to $3 billion over time.
And then, last but not least, we've seen really nice opportunities to originate in mortgage. We've pulled forward
kind of our $10 billion target into this year. And we'll see how that plays out, but we really like our capabilities and
we've expanded into new markets with mortgage systems and growth opportunities there.
And floor plan continues to be a steady driver. We always talked about – I'm sorry – Corporate Finance always
tends to be a steady driver. We've talked about $8 billion to $10 billion in that portfolio. We already hit $8 billion. I
think, well on our way to $10 billion as you look at the total opportunity in that segment. And then, we'll put cash to
work in securities as well. So, really, across the board, Moshe, we see really nice tailwinds and opportunities to
grow, in addition to the NIM expansion that we've been talking about this morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Right. And your medium-term kind of forecast talks about PPNR expansion on an annual basis. One of the
concerns that investors have had about the financials after the reports of the big banks has been expense growth.
Can you kind of talk about your plans? Because, obviously, PPNR expansion means that your revenue's got to
grow faster than expenses. But can you just talk about the plans for generating operating efficiencies and how
you think about that, particularly in light of the context, the remarks, JB, that you made about minimum wage,
phasing that in, and kind of how that will integrate into your plan over the next couple of years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. And, Moshe, just as a reminder, we don't manage kind of single line item point in time. We've been
managing the company to drive accretive returns, and we've been investing in growth. And what I shared with you

in the first couple of pages around continuing to invest in capabilities, grow customers, grow our balance sheet,
grow returns, that is the focus of us just in general. And we've been investing as a growth company. We've seen
kind of mid-single digit expense growth over the last couple of years. We'd expect to continue to see that.
But as we've demonstrated in the past, we're focused on positive operating leverage, PPNR expansion, robust
return trajectory. And you should expect more of that to come from a PPNR, as well as operating leverage
perspective. Now, I will note that with Fair Square coming into 2022, we'll have one month of expenses rolling
forward to 12 months. So, there's some nuances there. We do see positive operating leverage as we get into
2023. But definitely just some technical impacts this year from Fair Square.
But you wrap it all up, a lot of focus on expenses, but for us, it's really around growing our businesses and
growing revenue. We saw revenue up 25% this year. We have a very robust trajectory as we head into 2022 and
2023, and we'll keep investing, but leverage is front and center all the time.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I guess I've got a question on the retail Auto yield. I mean, I guess your expectations are
that continues to remain strong. I'm just curious, I know a lot of it's been driven by mix inside of retail Auto. But as
we think about just maybe competitive forces coming back into play, how much of a factor do you think it plays
into that yield going forward and over the next couple of years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, Sanjay. It's the fourth year of putting strong origination [indiscernible] (00:55:54) the books at 7-plus percent
yields, and we're guiding toward similar performance as we head into 2022. And it's simply a result of the growth
in dealers, growth in dealer engagement, where we think we still have significant opportunity for expansion. It's
the continued investment in our capabilities, including our SmartAuction platform insurance. And so, we don't see
any signs that, that will slow down as we head into 2022 and beyond. And competition is always intense. We
aren't seeing that interrupt our flows or impact our performance whatsoever as we head into 2022 and beyond.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
And, Sanjay, just obviously a reminder, number one lender in the prime space, one of the largest used lenders.
And to get that type of performance, you need to have significant scale, which is something we bring. And so, I
think we're large. We're fast. The dealers like us. We've automated a lot of our risk-based decisions so we

respond very quickly. So, yes, we recognize players come and go. But I think the one thing that dealers
appreciate about Ally is our stability and that's part of the – one of the big drivers why we continue to see a big
uptick in origination flows and why Jenn just guided even into the low $40 billion. So, it's pretty strong loan growth
year-on-year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
No, absolutely. You guys have executed really well. I guess, maybe another question on competition and follows
along some of the questions that Moshe was asking in terms of expenses. On the consumer lending side, that
targeted growth that you expect for Fair Square, I mean, like, is that just more direct marketing and, therefore,
there shouldn't be a significant ramp-up in marketing spend? Because we've heard the big banks as well as some
of the card issuers talk about ramping up expenses to get new accounts. I'm just curious sort of how you expect to
go to market there, and do you expect some pressure on expenses as you build that business out? And how does
it factor into the growth that you're expecting.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. And I think Fair Square is a bit unique. It's similar to what JB just mentioned on Auto. It's kind of a unique
product for a unique market. They're originating in that prime space, which is not nearly as computed as the super
prime space. And so, the direct marketing that they've been doing has been highly effective, as reflected in the
60-plus percent increase in customer accounts, as well as the growth in the balance sheet.
And all of the expenses attached to that are in the really robust guidance I've provided, which is kind of
immediately accretive from an ROTCE perspective. It will be accretive from an EPS perspective by year-end this
year, and it will drive operating leverage as we head into 2023. So, you can see that our investments are paying
off from a growth and a profitability perspective. And I think if anything, we can turbocharge that growth by
bringing them in inside the four walls of Ally and leveraging our existing customer base, Sanjay, which is not going
to require significant additions to our marketing spend.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And how much of that is factor? Like, is this cross-sell a big part of the growth expectation or is that just benefit,
added benefit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. None of that, Sanjay, is built into any of the numbers that we share. That'll be all upside. And, again, it will
be driven by synergies across our platforms much more so than increase in marketing spend.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

But, Sanjay, I mean, I would point out, though, what sometimes cross-sell gets knocked and the question of can
you really do it? I think if you look at our growth in multi-product relationships, it shows we are actually one of the
banks that's executing in that regard. And so, while we don't necessarily have it embedded in the guidance, I think
that's a clear focus point for us. So, how do we use the cross-sell of a massive customer base? I mean, if you
think of kind of another 9.5 million customers ex-credit card, it's even bigger than that, that exists at Ally; that is an
opportunity that we will go after.

Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. Maybe not to stay on card for too much, but it is kind of an exciting new area for you. But what's the
strategy for 2022? Are you going to rebrand to Ally? Are you going to go up market a little bit, or are you just
going to kind of let them operate under that Fair Square brand for the near-term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. And thank you, Arren. We agree, it's an exciting opportunity. And the short answer here is we're going to let
them continue to execute the way they've been executing over the last five years. It's been a tremendous product
growth story for them, and we don't want to interrupt the execution on that front. In parallel, we are looking to
rebrand their cards. We will do so by year end. And we do think that there's product expansion opportunities as
we just talked about over time. But that's going to be something we grow into as we think about the broader Ally
customer ecosystem.
And then last but not least, just a huge shout out to that team. It's just been a tremendous experience bringing
them on board. They know what they're doing. They've got decades of experience in card, and we couldn't be
more excited about the team, the products, the opportunity ahead in the cards space.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2022
continued to be able to grow margins in that space, as well as originations and balances. So we're not surprised
that there's some new entrants, but we feel really good about our products and our performance. And just as a
reminder, we're not kind of BNPL, [indiscernible] (01:02:58) product that's getting a lot of scrutiny across the
industry just in terms of consumer oriented practices. This is a traditional installment product. We go through
traditional credit underwriting. We have robust credit risk management around this product. So feel great about
the opportunity ahead.
