I'll now turn the call over to Steve Bradshaw.

Steven Glen Bradshaw
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning. Thanks for joining us to discuss the first quarter 2021 financial results. But before we get started,
I'll offer a few thoughts regarding the announcement earlier this month about my plans to retire, March 31 of next
year. After three decades with BOK Financial and more than seven years as President and CEO, this certainly
wasn't an easy decision.
I take a tremendous amount of pride in leading what I believe to be the best regional financial institution in the
country, one with a very clear focus on long-term shareholder value. However, I'm confident BOKF has never
been better positioned for this change. Our performance through the pandemic and my leadership team's
resiliency and cohesiveness throughout 2020 demonstrated expertise and synergy that stems from the true
hallmarks of our organization, experience and collaboration.
Over the next year, I'll be focusing on ensuring a smooth transition for my successor when that individual is
formally named by the board in the coming months. Those familiar with our company know that leadership
decisions are very intentional at BOKF. And we run the company with a long-term perspective, which includes
significant work on developing internal talent. And I fully expect the board to name an internal successor for CEO
at the appropriate time.
We are well-positioned to choose a successor soon. And I can reassure you that the next leader will continue the
same intentional long-term shareholder focus we are known for. In the meantime, I'll be focused on the slate of
goals and objectives we developed for 2021, which will continue to improve our competitive position and our
growth prospects into 2022 and beyond.
With that, let's look at the most recent quarterly results. Shown on slide 4, first quarter net income was $146.1
million or $2.10 per diluted share. While that's down modestly from the record earnings performance last quarter,
the difference between the first quarter of 2021 and that of 2020 could not be more stark.
The key items that drove the quarter were another outstanding earnings result from our Mortgage business as
activity remained elevated this quarter despite rising rates. The contribution from our Wealth Management team
continues to be a differentiator for us. Their results were off of a consecutive record quarters in late 2020 as we
had expected. The improving economic outlook combined with improving credit trends allowed us to release $25
million of our loan loss reserve. And lastly, expense management remains excellent as it has really throughout the
past year.
Turning to slide 5, loan growth continues to be a challenge this quarter as our commercial and commercial real
estate customers continue to pay down debt. While all borrowers continue to understandably reduce leverage in
the challenging economic environment, we believe we are poised for growth opportunities in the latter half of
2021, as the economy continues to rebound. Deposit growth remains excellent, up nearly 3% linked-quarter and
up nearly 30% from the same quarter a year ago, as we began to see the most recent wave of stimulus late in the
quarter.
Assets under management or in custody and our Wealth Management business continue to grow as the
protracted low-rate environment encourages market investment for yield-seeking clients. Investments in equities
is now 40% of our total assets under management or in custody, and that's up approximately $2 billion from year

end, which positions us to materially grow fees in our fiduciary and asset management business. I'll provide
additional perspective on the results before the start of the Q&A session.
But now, Stacy Kymes will review the loan portfolio, our credit metrics, and our key fee businesses in more detail.
I'll turn the call over to Stacy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Steve. Turning to slide 7, period-end loans in our core loan portfolio were $20.7 billion, down 3% for the
quarter, as we continue to see borrowers reduced leverage as expected in early 2021. Line utilization in the
overall portfolio has dropped from 68% pre-COVID to 62% at the end of the first quarter this year, with the largest
declines occurring in the energy, healthcare and general C&I portfolios, where cumulative line utilization is down
from 65% pre-COVID to 58% today.
As the economy continues to reopen, we feel confident that line utilizations will normalize, and our positive
outlook for loan growth will materialize later this year. Over the long term, we've always grown our loans at 2 to 3
times the normal rate of GDP growth and we believe our competitive position will continue to serve us well once
macroeconomic factors stabilize.
Looking at the energy portfolio, balances contracted 7.7% for the quarter. While commodity prices have continued
to improve and stabilize, sourcing new deals sufficient to offset paydowns in the current environment remains a
challenge as existing borrowers continue to reduce leverage. Despite these factors, we remain optimistic for
lending and energy-related revenue opportunities as we continue to support our customers in the space.
This industry vertical provides a great example of how we manage the bank to long-term economic outcomes as
opposed to short-term optics. During the first quarter, we recognized a $14 million gain on energy property sales
from an equity interest we received as part of a workout in this most recent downturn. We have consistently
indicated a willingness to own foreclosed assets. While the short-term impact of this was higher non-performing
levels, we held the assets until such time the market had improved and thus we're in a position to provide a full
economic recovery on this loan.
Healthcare balances were largely unchanged this quarter, as a pocket of growth in senior housing loans was
offset by a decrease in hospital system loans. Looking forward, we remain confident in our healthcare portfolio's
long-term growth and credit outlook and expect it to return to its status as a growth leader for us as health and
economic conditions migrate to a more normal state later this year.
PPP loan balances increased $166 million or nearly 10% and represent 8% of total loans. We originated $544
million of new PPP loans this quarter, maintaining our strategy of focusing on our existing client base to ensure
timely support of our existing client needs. Growth from new originations this quarter was partially offset by
paydowns of the first round of loans.
Forgiveness activity from previous rounds of PPP were slower in the [ph] first (00:08:04) quarter than our
expectations. The net interest revenue impact was about $10 million less than we anticipated. This should just
move into future periods when the forgiveness occurs.
Looking ahead, we remain optimistic in our outlook for loan growth in the latter half of this year, once these
unprecedented levels of liquidity normalize. The speed of vaccine distributions and the resulting broader

economic recovery today leads us to believe confidence and result in capital investment will return to the US
economy later this year.
Turning to slide 8, you can see that credit quality continues to be a clear differentiator for BOKF. We saw a
meaningful credit quality improvement across the broader loan portfolio with below expectation charge-offs and
criticized asset levels this quarter. This, coupled with the near-term stability in commodity prices and dramatically
improving economic metrics, led us to release $25 million in reserves this quarter.
Net charge-offs were down from $16.7 million or 31 basis points annualized net of PPP loans in the fourth quarter
to $14.5 million or 28 basis points annualized net of PPP loans this quarter. Net charge-offs totaled 31 basis
points net of PPP loans over the last four quarters, at the lower end of our historic loss range.
The combined allowance for loan losses totaled $385 million or 1.86% of outstanding loans at quarter end,
excluding triple PPP loans. The combined allowance for credit losses attributed to energy was 3.29% of
outstanding energy loans on March 31.
Non-accruing loans decreased significantly, down $19 million from last quarter, primarily due to a reduction in
non-accruing energy loans. Potential problem loans totaled $422 million at quarter end, down significantly from
$478 million on December the 31st. Almost all potential problem loan classes were down compared to the prior
quarter, led by potential problem energy and general business loans.
Looking ahead from a credit perspective, there is still a degree of uncertainty in the current environment. So it
remains difficult to predict. That said, based on what we know today and assuming our economic forecast is in
line as we advance, we believe 2021 net charge-offs will remain consistent with our experience over the last 12
months. We will continue to set our reserve at the appropriate level as we always have. We are generally positive
about the credit outlook for the remainder of the year, allowing us to continue to release this quarter. Once we
have more clarity around the spread of COVID-19, case count reductions, vaccine distribution and a broad
resumption of regular economic activity in 2021, we could potentially see additional opportunities for reserve
release this year.
Turning to slide 9, you can see the brokerage and trading fee revenues are down this quarter. When looking at
fee income and net interest income generated from our brokerage and trading business comprehensively, the
business is down about $15 million linked-quarter. This is largely due to some reversion from record volumes in
the third and fourth quarters and compressing margins in the mortgage industry that impacted trading margins by
about 70 basis points compared to the last quarter.
In addition, customer hedging revenue decreased $2.1 million, primarily due to a modest decrease in energy
customer hedging activities from the record fourth quarter. Investment banking revenue decreased $2.1 million,
mainly due to timing of loan syndication activity. While the net interest revenue and trading revenue related to our
enhanced mortgage trading desk experienced a slowdown from the record levels in 2020 as expected, it is still a
major contributor to the overall success of the company and is still up over 15% from the same quarter a year
ago.
Mortgage banking revenue decreased roughly $2.2 million linked-quarter, but remained strong despite a national
lack of housing inventory and rising interest rates. While margins have thinned relative to the historic levels in the
summer of 2020, they remained roughly 45% above where they were in March of 2020. Total production volume
this quarter remained consistent with prior quarters. And looking ahead, inventory constraints could continue to

build a case for these elevated production levels to be sustainable, as it will take a while before inventory is
materially improved.
Other revenue increased $2.1 million this quarter due to higher revenue from repossessed oil and gas properties.
Although not included on slide 9, I will also note that net economic changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing
rights and related economic hedges were positive $4.7 million during the quarter.
I'll now turn the call over to Steven to highlight our NIM dynamics and the important balance sheet items for the
quarter. Steven?

Steven E. Nell
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Stacy. Turning to slide 11. First quarter net interest revenue was $280 million, down about $17 million
from last quarter. While the poor yields on our loan portfolio were relatively stable, a reduction in average loan
volumes and the timing of loan fees including a $2 million decline in PPP fees linked-quarter was a drag on net
interest revenues this quarter.
Net interest margin was 2.62%, down 10 basis points from the previous quarter. Lower average outstanding loan
balances coupled with the reinvestment of cash flows from our available-for-sale securities portfolio continue to
impact net interest margin, with the portfolio yield declining 14 basis points to 1.84%.
Additionally, while we did have success driving interest-bearing deposit costs down slightly to 17 basis points, this
was at a decrease pace from previous quarters. While there are many moving parts to consider, including the
continued recognition of PPP interest and fees, the combination of continued repricing of the AFS portfolio and
the limited room to move interest-bearing deposit costs down further, will continue to impact net interest margin in
the coming quarters.
Turning to slide 12. Expense management remains prudent, with total expenses down 6% linked-quarter.
Personnel expense was down $3.2 million or nearly 2% this quarter. Cash-based incentive compensation
decreased $8.2 million, primarily due to decreased brokerage activity mentioned earlier. Deferred compensation,
which is largely offset by a decrease in the value-related investments included in other gains and losses,
decreased $3.4 million. Employee benefits increased $6.4 million, primarily due to a seasonal increase in payroll
taxes and retirement plan expenses.
Also, we're very happy with our ability to hold the personnel costs, efficiencies earned through the pandemic,
even with medical expenses increasing $1.7 million year-over-year, as employees now seek wellness and other
treatments deferred in 2020.
Non-personnel expense was down nearly $15 million or 12% from the fourth quarter. Half of this decrease was
due to a $14.1 million gain on the sale of equity interest received as part of the workout of a defaulted energy
loan, partially offset by additional expense and write-down of a set of oil and gas properties in the first quarter.
The remaining decrease in non-personnel expense was due to a decrease in business promotion expense of $1.6
million, a decrease of $2.3 million in professional fees and services, a decrease of $1.6 million in recruiting
expense, and a decrease in occupancy and equipment of $1.2 million, partially offset by an increase of $2.4
million spent on ongoing technology projects. Additionally, we made a $4 million charitable contribution to the
BOKF Foundation in the quarter, as we continue to focus on the communities we serve and the extreme needs
created by the pandemic.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2021
On slide 13, our liquidity position remains very strong, given the continued inflow of deposit balances. Our loan to
deposit ratio is now below 60% compared to nearly 64% at year-end, providing significant on-balance sheet
liquidity to meet future customer needs. Our capital levels remain strong as well with a common equity Tier 1 ratio
of 12.1%, well ahead of our internal operating range minimum. With such a strong capital level, we once again
were active with share repurchase, opportunistically repurchasing 260,000 shares at an average price of $77.20
per share in the open market.
On slide 14, I'll leave you with a general outlook for the near and mid-term. We believe net activity in loan growth
will slowly accelerate in tandem with the broader economic recovery this year, excluding the impact of PPP.
Our available-for-sale securities portfolio, which is largely agency mortgage-backed securities, yielded 1.84%
during the first quarter. Given the sustained low-rate environment, prepayments could reach approximately $700
million per quarter. We can currently reinvest those cash flows at rates around 95 basis points to 105 basis points.
At 17 basis points, we believe we believe we are close to the bottom in deposit pricing. The combination of
securities reinvestment at lower rates and minimal room to further lower deposit costs will push net interest
margin lower in the coming quarters. Our diverse portfolio of fee revenue stream should continue to provide some
mitigating impact to overall revenue pressure being felt in our spread businesses. We expect most fee revenue
categories to grow modestly in 2021 with the exception of brokerage and trading and Mortgage businesses as the
2020 record year in those areas will be difficult to replicate, as we've mentioned late last year.
We will continue our disciplined approach to controlling personnel and non-personnel costs with growth budgeted
at low single-digits in 2021. Our focus will be holding the line on manageable expenses without sacrificing multi-
year technology commitments to improve customer service and our competitive position. If the economy
continues to improve and we get further oil price stability this year, additional loan loss reserve release is
possible.
As I mentioned a moment ago, we feel good about our capital strength. We will continue looking for share
buyback opportunities and we'll maintain our current quarterly cash dividend level. We intend to bring all our
employees back to the office by the end of the second quarter, given improving health metrics and the wide
vaccine availability.
I'll now turn the call back over to Steve Bradshaw for closing commentary.

Steven Glen Bradshaw
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Steven. All told, it was a solid quarter for BOK Financial. Our Mortgage and Wealth Management
businesses, while down on a quarterly comparison, continue to offer a significant offset to the depressed loan
demand that plagued the industry and presenting a differentiated shareholder value for our company. Credit
quality outcomes this quarter are a testament to not only how well we've managed the ongoing crisis, but more
importantly, our ability to remain disciplined with credit decisions in more favorable parts of the cycle.
We agree with most forecasts that we are on the cusp of a period of rapid economic growth heading into the latter
half of this year and we believe that will translate to loan growth, an area BOKF has never been better positioned
to take advantage of than it is today. In the near term, as Steven mentioned in his outlook, we intend to bring all
employees back to the office by the end of the second quarter, given improving health metrics and the wide

vaccine availability. We know that we're better together and believe this will act as yet another positive catalyst to
our efforts to grow relationships and add new ones in the second half of this year.
With that, we're pleased to take your questions. Operator?

question.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
I wanted to ask about the loan pipeline. Can you just give a little bit more color on the tailwind that you're
expecting just based on the discussions you're having with clients? And then, also, just the extent of this excess
liquidity on their balance sheets and how it's impacting their ability to – appetite to borrow?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure. I'll talk about the loan pipeline and then turn it over to Steven to talk about the excess liquidity. Yeah. I think
we are seeing opportunities. Pipelines are growing really across the lending segment. But the level of liquidity that
exists in our clients' balance sheets is still very high. But if you look at our lack of loan growth, if you will, this
quarter, you really see two segments that traditionally lead for us. Both energy and commercial real estate were
down larger than normal.
And I think you heard me talk about in the fourth quarter call that we really thought energy would probably kind of
bottom out or reach an inflection point. We were hopeful in the first quarter, but we thought it was more likely in
the second quarter. I feel more confident today that we'll hit that inflection point in the second quarter for energy
as we began to work through the payoffs. Energy prices were very good in the first quarter. Most of those
8

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2021
borrowers used that extra cash flow to pay down debt. We had some anomalies in commercial real estate where
we had a higher level of paydowns in the first quarter. That area is going to grow just fine.
So, I think once those stabilize, then we can begin to show growth again. I think that that's really masking some
good activity that we hope to see. And we're still hopeful in the second half of the year, we're very optimistic that
you'll begin to see some core loan growth that will come out of that portfolio, which is why we highlighted the
utilization in our commentary.
We've got a lot of organic growth that will happen just by higher line utilization in our C&I book, in particular. And
so, once there's core economic activity that returns, I think there's going to be some really good line utilization
increases that will, beyond new customer acquisition, will help us grow our loans in the second half of the year.
So, we feel good about that. Clearly, it's hard to predict. You've got high liquidity on your customers' balance
sheets, but there's a lot of stimulus and there's more stimulus proposed. And we think that that's going to lead to
higher economic activity that will organically increase loan activity. But we feel good about it. And we feel good
about the quality of loans that we're adding to. We're focused on segments that are sustainable and meet our
credit fairway over a long period of time. And so we're not going to chase loan growth to meet market expectation,
but we'll stick to the core loan growth that has served us very well for a very long period of time.
I'll turn over to Steven to talk about the excess liquidity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So Peter, I was looking at our average deposits just from a year ago and they're up $8.3 billion, 29% and
$4.2 billion, that is in our commercial portfolios, our commercial clients, 35% increase. So, clearly, as you pointed
out, I mean there's significant liquidity on balance sheet. And how that plays into, when will that get used and if
some of that will get used prior to the loan growth that Stacy is pretty confident about, it could be, and we don't
know the answer to that. So yeah, significant liquidity and certainly, may play into usage of some of that before we
get some of the line utilization. We just don't know how much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
But I think if you really go back to that liquidity, part of that is [ph] the core (00:24:54) quality of our franchise. We
continue to attract high quality customers in deposits. Even though you've seen our cost of interest-bearing
deposits continue to decline quarterly, quarter-over-quarter, the movement that we've made there in the last 12
months is really very strong in spite of the fact that we're really not paying at a high level for those deposits will
continue to attract those, really speaks to the core franchise value of BOK Financial.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Can I ask a follow-up just on this line utilization. You mentioned, Stacy, that the core portfolio's line utilization went
from 55% to 58% today. How much, for every 1 percentage point increase in line utilization, does that impact
commercial loans? And where do you think it could go to by year-end?

In general, 1% about $150 million, so plus or minus from there. You can kind of do the math from there and see
what you think. We use pre-COVID as kind of a standard. We felt like that was a representative lot period for line
utilization. If you get higher economic activity than what we had pre-COVID, which is probably likely, then you'll
get higher line utilization that will exceed what we were pre-COVID.

Will Jones Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good. So, just piggybacking off of loan growth for just one sec. Just thinking about loans as a whole, I know
energy has really kind of been a lot of the burden here lately. Do you feel like balances today are kind of at a low
watermark on the total portfolio, or do you feel like there could be more shrinkage to come?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I think if you look at what we're calling the core loan portfolio, so if you look on slide 7 where we break out
the Paycheck Protection Program, I think that those loans will run their course. And so if you see that, that can
provide some headwind in the future as those get forgiven and will roll off. But in the core portfolio, clearly, energy
has been the headwind. This quarter real estate was also a headwind, which is – which traditionally is an area
we've grown pretty ratably over time.
The inflection point, I believe, is in the second quarter. Whether that's April, May or June, I don't know. But I do
think that we'll reach the inflection point where we do kind of bottom out in the second quarter at some point. And
then that's the level that we began to grow back from. We're seeing opportunities in energy. Yeah, I think that
even the rise in commodity prices in my view in the first quarter had a higher level – resulted in a higher level of
10

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2021
paydown activity than even what we were anticipating and forecasting, because those borrowers weren't using
that cash flow for CapEx. They were using that to continue to pay down revolver.
So, I think that we're within a quarter here of reaching that inflection point and then you'll begin to see loans begin
to grow back. As we've pointed to now for two quarters, second half of 2021 is really when we're expecting the
core loan growth to return.

Will Jones Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. No, that's great color. And it's really good to hear the optimism on energy as that plays out. And just lastly
for me, I just wanted to move over to, just thinking on M&A. I know BOKF has historically been pretty selective in
its deal pricing and deal choosing. But we've seen a great deal of activity already this year including Cadence and
BancorpSouth. That was – I mean, really kind of around BOK's backyard. Just curious on your thoughts on a
transaction of that magnitude, if BOK would ever be interested in that? And just more broadly speaking, how
active do you think BOK could be in M&A this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Glen Bradshaw A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. This is Steve Bradshaw. I'll take that one. We certainly acknowledge what's kind of going on in the financial
sector from a consolidation perspective. In fact, it seems even a little bit more acute in similar size banks to
BOKF, including those two that you just mentioned. And I think, to me, there's two major drivers for that. One is
the opportunity or desire to spread the expense base more broadly. And we have an interest in that and in our
most recent transactions, that's been a key element for us as well.
The second driver really is investment in technology. And you see that kind of mentioned time after time. I'll tell
you that we don't feel the same level of competitive urgency, because we've not taken any time off. We've
continued to invest in technology as an increasing percentage of our revenues really for the last five or six years
plus, and like our competitive position and feel like we're on track and are able to compete upmarket with large
investment firms as well as national banks.
So, that's not as big a motivation for us. So, we kind of come back to our core belief on M&A. We really want to
see banks largely within footprint that are high quality, have great employees and management teams and have a
broad business base. We don't expect them to have the same base as us, because we're unique even among our
peers. But we want to see something more than a larger real estate portfolio, frankly, because we're going to have
to – after we realize those energy – or not energy expense synergies, we have to grow it going forward. And so,
our mindset is really we use revenue as the guidepost for our acquisitions.
Can we can we add an acquisition that we think would be additive to revenue going forward? Your – the other
second part of your question was really size. Yes, if the size that we're at today, it would have to be a more
meaningful transaction for us than what we've done in the past. The most recent acquisition we did was about $4
billion in assets and it would need to be north of that in order to really move the needle in terms of [ph] expense
phase (00:32:01) and revenue growth. And also be worth the kind of inherent distraction that you introduce inside
your culture when you're assimilating one organization into another.
So, long answer to a short question, but I know what's on everybody's mind as we've seen so much activity and
some deals announced just really even as recently as this week. But that's how we're thinking about it. We would
expect to have an opportunity to participate in acquisitions going forward. But I think the bank that I described for
you is probably not a seller in today's economic environment. I think we're going to have to see some economic

I wanted to ask, I guess, first about the reserve and just thinking about reserve release from here. You had a
reserve that got below 1% pre-CECL. And I'm just curious how do you guys think about where the reserve might
be able to get to in this new CECL world assuming the economy gets to kind of a roaring [ph] 2020s (00:33:41)
scenario where things are pretty good. How do you how do you view the potential for the reserve to go down from
here?

Marc C. Maun A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yes. Marc Maun. First of all, just as a reminder, when CECL was implemented, there's a day one reserve
adjustment that had to be made. So, before the impact of the pandemic and so forth on our reserve, we had
added reserve that took it more to 1.2%. So, it came above the below 1% level. And then we added on additional
reserve build related to the economic downturn and the pandemic.
And so once we evaluate the future of the reserve, we will be taking into account the economic conditions. We'll
be taking into account our credit quality metrics, both of which we think will continue to improve throughout this
year. And then the other factor will be loan growth. And as that impacts it, we want to make sure we're managing
it at the appropriate level to address that. So, the combination of that – we hope that it will come down to that
1.2% level. But it'll be a combination of supporting loan growth as well as looking at potential reserve releases
associated with credit quality and economic outlook.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett D. Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group
Okay. Fair enough. And then on fee income, the guidance, I guess, if you want to call it, guidance for the
categories to grow modestly with the exception of brokerage and trading and mortgage. Can you give us any
thoughts around, one, mortgage from here, do you think gain-on-sale margins are [ph] going (00:35:28) to
continue atrophying or do you think 1Q sort of encapsulated the pressure that you get from where we were
previously with volumes?
And then just secondly, on brokerage and trading, obviously, volatility here the past two quarters, can you give us
maybe some thoughts around how things play out there as volatility in that business slows as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure. This is Stacy. And we've got Scott Grauer here as well who can chime in on the wealth side as well. But I
think as it relates to mortgage, I think we feel good about going into the second quarter. You've got some
seasonality in the Mortgage business where your second and third quarters tend to be pretty good quarters from
an activity perspective. That's going to help us a little bit. You have seen some thinning of the gain-on-sale
margins there, but they're still really good on a relative basis to kind of what normal is for that business.
And so, that's still a really good place to be. Even though they've fallen, they're still really strong. There could be
some pressure there, but it doesn't feel like a return to pre-COVID levels, if you will, in terms of where that is, at
least, from what we're seeing today. So, we – I feel good about kind of the next couple of quarters as it relates to
mortgage.
I feel really good about our growth in our wealth business. The brokerage and trading revenue broadly, but all
that's happening there, we really feel like what you saw in the first quarter is a number that we can do really well
with and maybe hopefully outperform into the second quarter, particularly. That is a sustainable number and one
we think we can actually grow from a little bit, as Steven alluded to, in his prepared comments.
So, we feel good about where we're positioned in both of those businesses. They are volatile. If you look at the
overall wealth business, brokerage and trading, both the NIR and the brokerage and trading fee revenue
component. So, total revenue for that business, it's up 50% first quarter-over-first quarter. So you've got that
tough comp with the fourth quarter, where it was just a record. And I don't want to lose sight of the fact that that
13

core business has grown substantially and we continue to commit capital to that. So our capital commitment to
the wealth business is up over 50% from this time a year ago. And we'll continue to support that, because we
really like that business.

Q
I guess just sticking on the wealth side. Looking at assets under management and administration kind of flattish
quarter-over-quarter and you also mentioned the $2 billion increase in equity balances. Can you give any color
on, I guess, what the differential between inflows or outflows and changes in market value were driving that
balance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure. So, this is Scott Grauer. And when you look at our total AUMA, we're actually really pleased with net inflows
in the first quarter. We have, during the course of the first quarter, very high planned distributions of assets, a lot
of it in our Corporate Trust Group. So we had total disbursements in the first quarter of over $11 billion. And so we
saw net sales, new sales of over $10 billion. So there is really kind of a moderate market increase of those total
AUMA.

Okay. Great. That's helpful.

For the first quarter [indiscernible] (00:39:29) high for that distributions from that. So, that's the big factor there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess just talking about building equities in that business, is that kind of a
longer term focus? Or I guess would you like to have it be more weighted towards equities to maybe protect the
margin a little bit more? I guess just higher level, what are your plans on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. And so, actually, we're – we like our allocation and our distribution amongst the asset classes. We have
continued to see, as have the broader markets, with fixed income at these nominal yields and real yields.
Equities, obviously, have just a better momentum in terms of asset flows. When you look at in the first quarter, we
were – just to give you an allocation, we were 12% cash, 42% fixed income, 38% equities, and about 8% in
alternatives. And that's a consistent mix. And we're getting a mix reflected off the assets that is on track with our
target allocations. So, we feel good about that distribution to weather and grow regardless of rate and equity
market performance. So, we feel good about it. We're always going to see efforts to try to grow our equity inflows,
because that's where flows, in general, are netting our positive in the overall market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. Thank you. I want to circle back on the loan growth discussion and you've covered the energy topic pretty
well. I want to ask about commercial real estate. It's not particularly large at the bank, but we did see a pretty
decent sized decline in the first quarter. Any color on what drove that decline and what's the outlook on
commercial real estate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
No. We feel good about the portfolio. I mean, you want a – at least, for us, you want a commercial real estate
portfolio that has some level of churn in it that indicates that deals are performing well and can be refinanced long
term in the permanent financing market, whether that's LifeCo or CMBS or whatever. We saw in 2020, because of
the pandemic, the lowest level of payoffs as a result of movement to the permanent financing market that we've
seen in the last 10 years, for sure. And so, what you saw in the first quarter was really more a return to normalcy
of kind of normal paydowns there where things are moving. We had maybe a little higher level of it, because we
had some pent-up opportunity there.
Commercial real estate, both the growth and the paydowns, tend to be lumpy and best to look at over a 12-month
horizon as opposed to kind of linked-quarter annualized. We'll be fine there. We'll have good growth in
commercial real estate. We think this year we're just going to have some lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter as
15

those advances and then the revised into the permanent financing market, non-recourse, long-term LifeCo-type
stuff will move out of the portfolio. And that from our view is the sign of a healthy portfolio and that's our view
about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Stacy. And then, on the healthcare side, I think overall balances were relatively stable in the first
quarter with kind of a mix shift growth in senior housing, paydowns and hospital. Any more details you can
provide? And is that any kind of inflection that we saw in the first quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think that is the inflection. We have some hospital systems advanced up in preparation for COVID and the
expense associated with that. I think we've seen kind of the tail of that in the first quarter where those are paid
back down. And then you saw that senior housing core growth begin to come back. We're really seeing really
good metrics coming out of our portfolios inside of senior housing. We can monitor it on a weekly basis. We're
watching occupancy come back up almost about 1% a month in our core senior housing portfolio. So, once that
portfolio really begins to stabilize, we do think there's some pent-up acquisition activity that can happen there that
will spur loan growth on the healthcare side. We've got a great team. We're well positioned for that. And I think
that, that will continue to be a growth driver for BOK Financial.

Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
I wanted to ask about how you're thinking about overall balance sheet management over the course of this year?
You are pretty fully invested. It seems like in the securities portfolio you do have some kind of excess balances,
but not nearly to the maybe extreme that some other banks do of several billion in cash. And I'm just wondering
how you're thinking about the potential for some shift in deposit flows over the course of this year as your
16

customers use their liquidity and put that to work, and given particularly the low rates that you were talking about
in terms of reinvestment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, this is Steven. I mean, if you look over the course of the year, we actually increased our available-for-
sale securities portfolio, $1.8 billion, so that's like 15%. So, we did kind of put to work, if you will, over the course
of the year some of the liquidity that was flowing in our direction. We, in fact, added $400 million this particular
quarter, first quarter. We'll reinvest cash flows I think going forward. But given the steep – a little bit steeper yield
curve, I doubt if you'll see us leverage up, if you will, that securities portfolio much more. I kind of like where the
balance sheet is.
We don't venture out. We haven't historically ventured out to asset-sensitive in previous periods. I think if you look
at a parallel shock of 100 basis points, we're about 2.5% asset-sensitive going forward. And that's a pretty good
level for us. We're comfortable with that.
So that's really, I think, what we're thinking about in terms of the securities portfolio, which is our primary lever for
managing interest rate risk here at the bank, and leaving that relatively stable by reinvesting cash flows, which
actually are a little bit better than they were in the previous quarter. I think our cash flow has slowed down a bit,
and the reinvestment rates are a little bit stronger than they were last quarter. So, that's helpful as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
The other thing – this is Stacy – I might speak to is, is particularly as you – people think about and talk to – start to
project more asset sensitivity. When you look at various disclosures around that, there are just a host of
assumptions that go into that sensitivity analysis. And it's very hard to get apples-to-apples comparisons across
the regional bank spectrum in terms of exactly how folks are looking at that. But I would encourage the analyst
community to go look at actual results the last time rates went up. I mean, if you think about we've had a recent
cycle pre-COVID when rates were rising and you could really see the performance of folks' balance sheet as a
result of that, I think that's a better indicator in many respects than what folks are going to project through their Q
and K around asset sensitivity as we think about this going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks for that. Steven, going back to my initial question, I apologize if I didn't ask it clearly. I guess, I – what I
was really asking you is, given that you don't have as much excess liquidity on the balance sheet, do you – are
you – do you not have any major concerns about outflow of customer deposits as some of the stimulus burns off,
whereas other banks are holding a lot more excess liquidity. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
No. No. No.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2021
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
I don't think we do. I mean I kind of described earlier that the increase in those balances, I mean, Scott's world in
wealth has increased a couple of billion. There could be some outflows of that in the future, if they find other
places to invest. But I don't think we're too concerned about all that flowing away anytime soon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. That's great. And then kind of finally up on Stacy's comments, Steven, if you could maybe give us just a
quick overview of kind of where BOKF is positioned in the loan portfolio from variable versus fixed rate loans and
kind of the impact of floors potentially as we can do get towards...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. I can do that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
...higher rates?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
So, about 70% of our loans are either variable or they're going to repriced within a year, so – and that gives you
an idea there. We have, of the $22 billion loan portfolio, about $3.8 billion, maybe just $3.4 billion hedge floors
embedded in it. We're getting a benefit of about $18 million to $20 million annualized on those floors and they're
supporting NIM about 4 basis points.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And then just last one if I could squeeze one more question in here. In terms of PPP, with the addition of
the second round here, can you just tell us what the total remaining fees are yet to be recognized through that
line?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yes, I can do that. So, the original 2020 fundings of $2.3 billion on PPP, we had fees associated with that of about
$59 million and the first quarter 2021 fundings this last round, there's fees of about $23 million associated with
that. So, a total of about $82 million. And we recognized $36 million in 2020. We kind of expect to recognize
around $30 million in 2021. And then we'll see how the rest flows out, but likely most of it in 2022 for the
remainder of that balance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And of the $30 million you expect in 2021, how much was recognized in the first quarter?

Correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Now you've got the interest and, of course, the cost of funds against that – against the 1%. So, the total PPP in
[ph] IRR (00:50:40) benefit in the first quarter was about $14 million, which is down a little bit from the fourth
quarter. That's one of the reasons that our NIM declined a little bit more than what we expected just because of
that PPP activity. But that's probably just a push in the future quarters.

Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, we think it plays out to our benefit. I mean, I think, if you think about we're about 13%, I guess, of our
portfolio is energy loans today. We've been as high as 22%. We have lots of capital that we're willing to commit to
the space. I think that as we look forward, I think that creates opportunity for us. We've often talked about what we
like about energy is a full share of customers wallet.
So, we do derivatives trading. We have the private bank business with the executive team. We have their 401(k).
We have their deposit business. And we have really good risk-adjusted spreads in that business as well. And so
we like – as we look forward over the next two, three, four, five years, we really like the profile of this business
and the opportunity to grow it, because as you've mentioned, you are having some smaller competitors who are
walking away from it.
Now what will be interesting to see is, it's easy to walk away from that business when commodity prices are a
struggle and executives have to talk about asset quality on an earnings call. As you build some good results in
this business going forward, you may have some folks who step back into the business, particularly in our
footprint.
But we are really excited about where we're positioned here. I mean, if you think about our place in the league
tables, relative to production in this business, we are competitive with the very large national banks here. And so,
as this area begins to return, seeing some information just over the last week that talked about storage levels
globally are at pre-COVID levels today, but demand levels are not at pre-COVID levels. So, if you just kind of see
that through, I think there could be some more tailwind for some prices in the short term, which would be positive.
But I think we really like the business. We like where we're positioned in the business. I don't think there's a better
energy team in the country than at BOK Financial. So, we're excited to grow the business.
