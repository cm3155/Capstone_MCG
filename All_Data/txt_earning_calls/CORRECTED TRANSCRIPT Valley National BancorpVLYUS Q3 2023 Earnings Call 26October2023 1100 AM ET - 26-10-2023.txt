Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Travis. In the third quarter of 2023, Valley reported net income of $141 million and earnings per share
of $0.27. Exclusive of non-core items, adjusted net income and EPS were $136 million and $0.26, respectively.
Our quarterly results were highlighted by organic capital growth, sound asset quality metrics, improved core
deposit flows and solid expense control.
The current interest rate environment, reflective of an inverted curve has challenged traditional banking models
and we have not been insulated from these pressures. That said, while the duration of the current inversion has
exceeded original expectations and is anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future, we do not intend to
change our foundational business model.
Our net interest income declined at a much lower pace in the recent quarters and we believe that NII is near the
bottom of its decline, all else equal. While the external environment remains fluid, our focus on executing our
strategic initiatives remains steadfast. One of our strategic efforts over the last few years has been to transform
our core operating environment to allow flexibility in integrating unique delivery channels, enhancing fintech
integrations and positioning the bank for scalability without the traditional technology expense hurdles.
I'm pleased to report that during the first weekend of October, our team worked tirelessly to complete the
transformational conversion of our core operating system. This was a massive undertaking, which required
months of planning, development and testing. Valley is now operating on a single system with bespoke delivery
channels, and I couldn't be prouder of our disciplined ability to execute on this project, which I reiterate was done
in the face of an extremely challenging operating environment.
This technology conversion is a natural progression of a cultural revolution that has occurred over the last few
years. We have collectively developed a growth-oriented mindset, which has been evident in our recent financial
results. To support this mindset, we continuously strengthen and develop our capabilities to bring us more in line
with the largest players in our industry.
Our bankers now have a more robust infrastructure and we expect to see significant opportunities to leverage
these new technologies and drive additional growth as the environment normalizes. Our successful conversion
was yet another example of our discipline and proven ability to execute. As we enter 2024, we anticipate
generating both expense efficiencies and revenue scale, resulting from our common core platform.
As we have moved to a cloud-based infrastructure, we're not burdened with the massive hardware cost that are
typically associated with type of technology investment. We are more nimble today than we were a month ago,
and the opportunities ahead of us remain significant.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom and Mike to discuss the quarter's growth and financial results.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Thank you, Ira. Slide 4 illustrates the approximately $300 million of total deposit growth during the quarter. We
experienced strong growth in interest bearing transaction account and retail CDs, which offset non-interest
bearing deposit declines and indirect CD maturities. The pace of non-interest bearing deposit runoff has slowed,
but mix shift to interest bearing products has continued to weigh on our total deposit cost.
Slide 5 provides more detail on the continued diversity of our deposit portfolio. During the quarter, we benefited
from stability in our branch-based deposits and strong growth in our specialized verticals. Inflows were particularly
strong in our national deposits business and through our online channel. These dynamics enabled us to pay off
some maturing indirect CDs during the quarter. We also continued to reduce our adjusted uninsured deposit
exposure and have significant coverage with cash and high quality liquidity.
Slide 6 further illustrates the diversity and granularity of our deposit base. No single commercial industry accounts
for more than 7% of our deposit. Our government portfolio remains diversified across our footprint and is fully
collateralized relative to state collateral requirements.
Now turning to slide 7, you can see an overview of our loan growth and portfolio composition. Annualized loan
growth on a year-to-date basis has slowed consistently as the year has progressed. Originations declined
meaningfully during the quarter as we require wider spreads on new loans. These efforts continue to result in
higher new origination yields.
Slide 8 breaks down the diversity of our commercial real estate portfolio by collateral type and geography. As a
reminder, we have an extremely granular loan portfolio, with an average loan size of roughly $5 million. From a
metric perspective, our weighted average LTV remains at 58%. As interest rates have increased, debt service
coverage ratios have declined somewhat to 1.7 times.
We continue to closely monitor pools of maturing and resetting loans and believe that our borrowers are well-
positioned to absorb the pass through of higher rates. This reflects consistent underwriting discipline at
conservative cap rates and significant stress testing efforts at origination. The following slide illustrates the
continued strong metrics and granular composition of our diverse office portfolio.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn to provide additional insight on the quarter's financial.

Thanks, Tom. Slide 10 illustrates Valley's recent quarterly net interest income and margin trends. The sequential
$7 million decline in net interest income was less than half of the reduction experienced in the second quarter of
the year. While asset yields continue to improve, continued pricing competition and mix shift drove funding costs
higher. On the second quarter call, we indicated that we were observing signs of net interest income stabilization.
During the quarter, monthly net interest income was generally stable and higher than the June level.
Our fully tax equivalent net interest margin declined a modest 3 basis points on a linked quarter basis versus 22
basis points in the second quarter of 2023, and has been generally stable over the last few months. All else equal,
we expect fourth quarter net interest income to be relatively in line with the third quarter level. By the end of the
quarter, our liquidity position has been effectively normalized. Absent abnormal environmental factors, we expect
cash to remain generally consistent with third quarter levels.
Moving to slide 11, we generated nearly $59 million of non-interest income for the quarter as compared to $60
million in the second quarter. Exclusive of approximately $6 million of non-core items, adjusted non-interest
4

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
income was closer to $52 million for the quarter. The decline was primarily related to lower capital markets fees
associated with our slower loan growth. Other business lines were generally stable.
On slide 12, you can see that our non-interest expenses were approximately $267 million for the quarter, or
approximately $264 million on an adjusted basis. Adjusted expenses declined from the prior quarter, despite an
increase in certain technology costs, partially associated with our successful core conversion. Specifically, we
began to see the benefits of recent head count reductions about midway through the quarter.
FDIC assessment costs and outside consulting fees also declined on a sequential basis. We continue to execute
on previously identified efforts to slow future expense growth. Legacy Valley and Leumi have now joined on a
common core. After a certain adjustment period, we expect the core conversion to result in the next wave of
previously announced cost savings early in the New Year. To reiterate, our focus is on controlling expenses in the
face of revenue pressures, which have resulted from the inverted yield curve.
Turning to slide 13, you can see our asset quality trends for the last five quarters. Non-accrual loans have been
effectively flat for the last three quarters. Early stage delinquencies ticked up during the quarter, but remain well
below the average level of the last 12 months. Third quarter net charge-offs declined somewhat from recent
levels.
On slide 14, you can see that tangible book value increased approximately 1.4% for the quarter and is up nearly
10% from a year ago. Our balance sheet positioning has enabled us to avoid the significant challenges that other
peers have faced related to the OCI impact associated with available-for-sale securities. We manage all risk
areas prudently and are proud in our ability to insulate tangible capital from this headwind.
Tangible common equity to tangible assets increased to 7.4% during the quarter as a result of our normalized
cash position. As loan growth slowed, our risk-based regulatory capital ratios have increased between 16 and 18
basis points as compared to the second quarter of 2023. We continue to prioritize organic capital growth in this
challenging environment and are prudently managing our balance sheet to incrementally strengthen our position.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our
first question comes from Frank Schiraldi with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning, Frank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just on the trajectory of NII/NIM, I mean, you talked about the hopeful trough here. In a higher for longer scenario,
just thinking out into 2024, do you think there is some stabilization in NIM and then you get a reversal from there,
so you get a little bit of a trajectory upwards or is it more sort of like in higher for longer sort of bouncing along the
bottom for a period of time? Just wondering your general thoughts there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Hi, Frank. It's Mike. I think that when you look at the trajectory of NIM in 2023, as we said in our prepared
remarks, we've been in that mid-2.90s to low 2.90% range since April. And when you look at the cost of deposits,
you'll notice that from fourth quarter, the first quarter, they were up 60 basis points. From first quarter 2023 to
second quarter 2023, they were up 49, and they were up 49 in the third quarter as well.
So, we're starting to see a normalization both in the cost, but also in the NIM. In a higher for longer rate
environment, I think a couple of things would happen that would, all things being equal, result in a slightly higher
NII and slightly higher NIM. The first of those and has been true for all of 2023, the biggest driver of the
compression on our NIM has been the rotation out of non-interest bearing and into interest bearing product.
So, I would think in a higher for longer environment, there is some place, some equilibrium that we see a plateau
on that. Second, you got to keep in mind that we've had a very large liquidity build both at the end of the first
quarter and throughout the second quarter, as a result of all the chaos that was created with the bank failures
earlier this year, that is completely off our balance sheet as of 9/30.
And then, when you go forward and you kind of think about deposits stabilizing, I think the thing that will drive, at
least in our current modeling, the thing that will drive NIM expansion and NII increases is going to be the repricing
on our assets, earning assets, but more specifically loans. And as we look at our modeling, we know what our
fixed rate book repricing is along with the repricing opportunities that we have throughout 2024 and the adjustable
rate book. So, we would expect that to be the main driver of [ph] any (00:15:18) NIM expansion next year.

Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. Appreciate all the color, Mike. And then, just as a follow-up to that. In terms of the brokered
balances, it looks like you guys have had some really good success raising customer deposits, and so you've got
these roll off. I guess, do you expect that to continue? And if so, as you look out the maturation table, when do
you expect or how quickly do you expect brokered balances to kind of fall here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yes. So, our current thinking and our current modeling is that we will see further reduction in our brokered
balances, and that's certainly one of our goals. But I want to make sure everybody understands how we've been
using brokered. We've been using brokered throughout 2023 to fill the gaps, especially earlier in the year, we had
much higher loan growth to fill the gaps on the balance sheet expansion, while also paying very close attention
that we're not repricing the back book of our deposit, our core deposit base.
And then, the second thing that we've done is we've used that in those stopgap measures. We've used both
duration and rate in that portfolio to help manage our NIM and NII. And so, while I know they have a bad
connotation sometimes, they've been very effective and the market has been excellent for us to use that in certain
times and in certain circumstances, and were very effectively.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And just lastly on that front, in terms of as you look at the indirect market versus what you're able to get directly
from customers here, is there much of a difference in terms of pricing, in terms of new brokered versus new
direct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, the inversion of the curve probably is the biggest impact on that. If you're talking about exactly the same
duration, I would say the incremental cost of deposits is fairly close to one another. So, there may be 10 basis
point difference, but it's not that remarkably different. So, I think, again, I'd go back to my previous comments is,
you want to use that for both rate and duration, but in the case that you're asking about, you probably want to
manage duration in this inverted curve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Frank, this is Ira. I would just add to that. When we think about the incremental piece of deposits as Mike alluded
to earlier, there were significant demand for us to put some of those incremental deposits on based on the loan
growth we were seeing, and that obviously ratcheted up the incremental cost of some of these deposits.
As we now have scaled back some of the loan growth, the demand for those brokered deposits and higher cost
CDs have actually come a bit down and we're still originating core deposits, I think as we spoke about last time on
the call. The overall deposit originations for this quarter were around 3.70, 3.80-ish. So, up, so on a blended
basis, marginal deposits are coming in much cheaper than what these directs are. And as we curtail the loan
growth, we definitely anticipate some expansion on margin based on that increment will be the loan that's coming
on. [ph] Sorry, folks (00:18:35).

Stephens. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, good morning, everybody. Maybe just sticking with the NIM. Can you provide what the monthly NIM was
across the quarter? And is the September, the September NIM, a good launch point into fourth quarter about
where it could shake out for the fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
Matt, this is Travis. Just on a monthly basis, July with 2.91%, August 2.92% and September 2.91%. So, when we
say it was pretty stable throughout the quarter, I mean, we really mean it. So, you can [indiscernible] (00:19:33)
September end and the quarter with the same number. But yeah, that's a good launch point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thank you. And then, I was hoping also for some additional color on near term loan growth outlook and maybe
perhaps when you would feel comfortable reaccelerating loan growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, Matt, it's Tom. The loan growth, the fact is slowing it down really customer related, the uncertainty of the rate
market as well as widening spreads has slowed down their activity. We still service those valued real estate
customers, when they need it and we continue to grow that portfolio just had a much slower pace. I just want to
point out our C&I portfolio has grown 12% over the last year. So, our focus is really on that relationship driven C&I
piece. We're still getting higher percent growth in the Florida market and stable growth here in the Northeast. I
would expect that growth in the fourth quarter to be in a similar fashion to the third quarter, and we'll be in that
range of 7% to 9% for the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. Okay. And then, Ira, just acknowledging yours and Valley's relationship with Bank Leumi and first, just
wishing everybody on your end and on Leumi's end the best as they deal with the horrific events over in Israel. In
light of that, I was curious, if events overseas will have and because of the partnership, any impact on your bank
balance sheet or private client group in any way?

Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you very much. I appreciate that. And all of our employees and clients, it's been a very difficult time. That
said, Bank Leumi obviously is a significant partner for us on the participation side. We haven't seen any
interruption as of yet and we continue to anticipate business as usual, so. But it's definitely difficult for a lot of
people, we still think we're going to continue to move forward and not be impacted by it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Hey, Matt, it's Tom. Just kind of give you a little context here. The only direct loan exposure we have is to
high net worth US citizens, and it's secured by state of Israel bonds as a very, very small portfolio. Otherwise, we
help finance domestic subsidiaries of Israeli companies, but it's all done here in the US and US-based entities.
The back and forth and flow of business slows down really based on macroeconomic conditions, but it's business
as usual and working with them on partner transactions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then, could you give us some update as to where we are in the previously mentioned cost
saving plan? I believe it was like $40 million identified. Last week, we spoke it was expected to progress over four
quarters. How is execution matching up versus planning? And is there anything else you've uncovered as you've
kind of looked into this in terms of additional cost saves?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, Matt, it's Travis. In the quarter, I'd say you probably about 20% to 25% of, on an annualized basis, what we
had anticipated. I don't expect much incrementally in the fourth quarter. Post-conversion, we're keeping this four
teams stacked up and running. But then, as we get into the first half of 2024, I think that's where you get the next
wave, which will come from a combination of third-party vendors and some additional resource efficiencies. So,
yeah, I don't anticipate much in the fourth quarter. But again, once we get to the first half of 2024, I think that's
where you see the bulk of what's remaining. We are still looking obviously post-conversion at opportunities that
we hadn't previously identified, and so, we'll continue to dig there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And we should be thinking of this expense plan as one that slows down the natural pickup in expenses
versus one that dollar-for-dollar lowers the run rate, correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
That's correct. So, I mean, if you think and this is just high level, I don't mean for these to be numbers to take
away. But historically, we've run kind of high single-digits from an operating expense growth perspective as a
growth company. There are obviously headwinds from an inflation perspective, FDIC cost regulatory perspective
on top of that. And then, we're just trying to work our way back into kind of that mid-single-digit expense growth
level based on these initiatives.

syndicated loan exposure? What's the size of that book? How is it performing? Any other metrics we should be
aware of there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A

Yeah, sure, Matt. It's Tom again. The portfolio is about $1.4 billion spread over a number of loans. We're not HLT
lenders, we don't really have leverage transactions in there. They're mostly closed deals with a small group of
banks, direct contacts, relationships with any of the borrowers in the [ph] rolling (00:24:45) market.

Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I apologize. I got on a couple minutes late. So, if you guys addressed this already, I apologize for asking again.
But just taking into context all the commentary you guys have given around NII and the expense plan kind of
execution, is it fair for us to be thinking about that the third quarter of 2023 as probably the peak in the efficiency
ratio here? And are you guys, at this point, able to provide any kind of context around the type of year-on-year
improvement you're hoping the expense plan can drive, assuming your NII projections kind of play out as you
expect them today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
So I don't think there's any bank CFO that would say that third quarter would tend to be their peak. I think fourth
quarter tends to be the peak for a lot of reasons, right. You have year-end expenses that get pushed through.

There's some bonus accrual work sometimes in the fourth quarter that might drive costs up. So, I wouldn't
necessarily agree with that its third quarter, but I would point you back to Travis's comments before that.
If it's fourth quarter, that's actually the peak. Again, in the first half of 2024, we expect to realize the vast majority,
the remainder in the vast majority of our previously announced cost savings initiatives, which in turn would then
drive down our efficiency ratio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. And then, just a couple more quick ones on, I think the kind of New York, New Jersey area
of credit, commercial real estate dynamics, we probably beat the dead horse on that for quite some time now. But
just curious, if you guys can maybe provide some context about updated demographics and trends you're seeing
in the Florida and Alabama market? I mean, are there similar kind of supply and demand dynamics? Is there still
kind of inflow of population growth? And just wondering kind of what the demographics are down there more
recently?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, sure, Michael. This is Tom. The impacts of slowing and higher interest rates are affecting them also. The
metrics on the transactions we do aren't any different. They were below 60% loan to value, usually 1.6% or 1.7%
debt service coverage. So, we're still generating transactions with those similar metrics. We are seeing continued
growth in those markets. The population migration has slowed, but there's still migration into that Florida market.
Our consumer business is strong down there, but probably half of what it was in the earlier part of this year. It's
still a growth market for us in all cases, but I'll continue to point out, we underwrite very conservatively in all
markets. We have floors at our cap rates in all markets, we track those cap rates. We're more suburban than
urban. We're not big players in the Miami market, we're more spread around the six or seven other major areas of
Florida.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks, Tom. Really helpful. And then, just the last one for me. Just once again, kind of taking into context, all
your other commentary. Is it fair for us to be thinking about kind of the asset base to be pretty stable here for the
next several quarters? And then, possibly some lift beyond that, assuming the environment is permitting of kind of
growth reaccelerating. Is that similar to how you guys are budgeting it, or is there any kind of anything that you
would point to, that could make it different?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
I think you have it generally, right, Mike. I mean, I think, end of the third quarter, our cash position was
normalized. I think Tom referenced the growth that we anticipate in the fourth quarter and then kind of picking up
maybe somewhat in 2024. But I don't think there's any type of significant other changes that you would see on the
balance sheet.

you tied it to loan growth. What kind of expectations should we have for capital markets? And then, also curious, if
there's any kind of expense offset, how much bottom line impact there is to lower capital markets fees?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Hey, Jon, it's Tom. Yeah, the capital markets for us is really been driven by gain on sale in the consumer
resi space, as well as swaps in the commercial space. We expect that to be flat going forward, we don't expect
any lift there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q

Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
We have other avenues. We have a tax advisory business. We get a slight uptick in the fourth quarter to get
things closed by year-end. We continue to build out our FX and trades, which shows progress quarter-to-quarter,
but we're expecting flat into next year.

there? Anything that you're thinking about there that we should be aware of?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
No, no. I'm looking at it, really, it's coming out of the consumer and resi bucket. On the consumer side, it's
primarily our cash surrender value life insurance business. It's a matter of liquidating and collecting on there. So,
that's not going to be problematic from any potential loss standpoint.
On the resi side, I just want to point out our 2Q levels were abnormally low. We are still below where we were a
year ago at this point, we're about $99 million third quarter of 2022, we're $79 million in third quarter 2023. So,
we're really gravitating to more normal levels. So no, we don't anticipate any problems.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, good. And then, Mike, you referenced slide 4 that upper right chart with the deposit cost increases. And
what do you think that looks like in a quarter or two? I mean, you referenced $49 million and $49 million for the
last two quarters, but is that curve bending at all from the $49 million?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
If it's bending, it's ever so slight. I think you'll see the real bend inflection point happen early next year, but you still
see some migration. It's slowed considerably, but you still see some migration from non-interest bearing into
interest bearing. From a incremental next dollar cost of deposit funding and more broadly even liability funding
that is definitely stabilized in that mid-5-ish range.

You spoke about getting high yields on new originations and that fixed rate loan repricing will be one of the main
drivers of NIM expansion from here. Can you give us some more color on what level of loans are repricing? What
level loans are repricing at currently? And if you could size the amount of fixed rate loans that are coming due
over the next year or so?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, it's Tom here. Give you some context. We repriced about $1.8 billion of loans for the first nine months of
this year. The spread, it really depends on asset class, but the spreads are around the [ph] 350 (00:33:13) or so
range. We expect that to continue. Looking forward, there's probably another $600 million of reprices over the
next six months. We expect those spreads to be the same. There's also a lot of renewing loans, loans that will
mature. So, it tends to be in that $1 billion or so range over the next six months in total.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, I think that number is a little bit overstated, right. So we have a little bit understated, excuse me. So, we
have about [ph] $20 million (00:33:41) fixed rate portfolio. Average life has extended to about five years. So, if you
do the math, I mean, just assuming all else equal, you'll get about $4 billion a year of fixed rate loans that that
come due and would ultimately reprice higher.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
And I think the one other thing, if you look at, I forget what the slide it is, maybe the slide 7, you can look at the
credit spreads, right? So, if you go back to just three quarter of 2022 and you look at where the new origination
yield was versus where the index was, you're sitting around a 200 basis point spread.
And if you do the same math just today, you're sitting at about 270 basis point spread. So, new originations are
coming on, definitely had a higher spread and as Travis and Tom both alluded to, the repricing is probably going
to come on at 300 to 400 basis points above where current rates are today on those. So, there's a significant
pickup when you think about the $4 billion plus or minus of what's going to be the next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
This is Mike. I'll just add to what Ira said. So, the simple average of new loan originations in the second quarter
was 7.38%, and for the third quarter, it was 7.89%. And the last month, September, that quarter finished just over
8%. So, clearly, we're seeing repricing on new loan originations, both from the spread increases that both Ira and
Tom mentioned. And then, also just because of the discipline that we have around here to make sure that we're
getting paid for the risk we're taking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
And kind of maybe just one final thing. I think this is an important piece, right? When we think about sort of our
overall portfolio and how we manage the balance sheet, obviously based on sort of the sensitivity that we have,
there was a decline in the NIM maybe earlier than some of our peers were. But we do have a significant amount
of tailwind coming from the assets that are going to be priced. So, once we get into a more stable environment,
whether it is higher for longer or just stable from where we are today, there is that tailwind that's going to come
from the significant amount of assets. And I think that will be a significant positive for us.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
That's very helpful. And maybe just on the flip side, on the funding side, the [ph] 3.60% (00:35:53) or so pricing
that you mentioned that deposits are coming on at right now, would you be able to provide a breakdown between
CDs and savings accounts and what those are coming on at right now? And also, if there is any update to your
through the cycle deposit beta guide of around mid-50s?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
So, on regular savings accounts, you're probably in the mid-3-ish type category, but we also have a high yield
savings account out there in our direct channel, which is in the mid-5, maybe actually low-5s. And while we don't
have a new CD special, we haven't had a new one for a while. We're retaining anywhere from about 92% of all
maturing CDs. So, I think that when you think, as I said earlier, when I talked about the incremental cost of the
next dollar of funding, it's going to be in that mid to low-5 range. But you got to realize that it's in certain pockets
within our deposit pricing where we've had some growth that are a little more competitive. And that's just for that
incremental CD that's coming on.
I think the bigger piece is that we had our strongest quarter-to-date of new account opening. So, now, you're
seeing a mix shift still continuing and average coming out of the non-interest bearing. The number of accounts in
non-interest bearing continue to escalate significantly, and we were able to grow both consumer and commercial.
And just as an example, in the month of September, it was a blended commercial that came on with that rate of
[ph] 2.48% (00:37:30) for our overall deposit base. So, while Mike's correct in looking at some of those CDs and
what that the specials are, keep in mind, we're still originating and opening core accounts in this organization, like
we haven't ever historically been before.
And that will have, continue to have a positive impact on how we think about what those marginal funding costs
are. So, the marginal funding cost that you saw [ph] 3.60%, 3.70-ish (00:37:54) for the quarter on that blend is
something we anticipate to continue assuming interest rates stay at the current levels.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. And the through the cycle deposit beta of mid-50s, any update on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Our through the cycle estimate was for the fourth quarter 2023 year to the third quarter 2023, we're in the mid-
50s, so it's likely that we'll end up above that. But that's factored into all the commentary that we've already given
about stable NII in the near term and opportunity to expand NII as we get into 2024.

Good morning, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Maybe just on, good morning. On credit here and just to the dynamic of fixed rate loans repricing, just curious
what you are seeing for the impact on debt service coverage ratios? And what's the dynamic of, how many clients
have to put up additional cash to support a loan or project?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, sure. Steve, its Tom. As I mentioned earlier, we repriced in 2023 or reset the rate in 2023 on $1.8 billion of
our loans. We did not have to modify the contractual payment terms on any of them. They just reset flow through
with continued P&I payments, no cash upfront to the customer that need it. I want to point out our upfront
underwriting underwrites more conservatively. Typically at 1.6, 1.7 times average debt service coverage, a 60%
LTV, so that creates cushion in our upfront analysis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. But just given that rates have moved up quite a bit here in the last month or two, you still expect that
dynamic to play out into 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, I mentioned earlier, I think there's another $600 million that will reset over the next six months. We
do a forward analysis of this. We don't expect any different results or modifications based on that analysis today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Maybe just highlighting what Tom said and you said it twice now, and I just want to make sure everyone is
hearing what he said. We did $1.8 billion and now, one client had to come and bring additional equity into it. They
reset us to what they were. And I think that's something significant when we look at how we underwrite loans, day
one, how we think about resetting these loans and the capacity of our clients to pay. And I think that's a big
distinction with versus what you're seeing at other organizations today.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Great. No, I appreciate all the color. And then, just in terms of, as we think about the outlook going forward here.
Just curious, Ira, I know you said you're focused on organic growth and internally, but are you seeing more M&A
opportunities or has any thought process changed here just given the more volatile macro environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Think on the back end, what we're seeing with regard to the curve, there's going to be definitely a lot more
opportunities based on some of the challenges that many banks have. That said, I think we've been very diligent
and disciplined around our tangible book value, and to have a deal work in this environment becomes very, very
challenging. So, some of the economics need to change.
If you go back to the tangible book value we had $3.30 of 2018, which was the first quarter that this management
team took over, we were sitting at $5.64. They were sitting at $8.63, which is pretty much $3 of incremental
tangible book value. When you add in the dividends that we paid out, $2.86 during that same period, we have
effectively doubled the tangible book value in a 5.5 year period. And I think that's something that this management
team is very, very proud of. We want to make sure, as we think about potential acquisitions as we move forward
that we're not [ph] denigrating (00:42:13) that kind of a track record.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon. Just one follow-up M&A question. Obviously, the intensity of the events from March have
subsided, but doesn't feel like we're quite out of the woods yet. Just wanted to make sure that when we talk about
whole bank M&A versus organic growth, Ira, I would love your thoughts on FDIC assisted deals or if that were to
still come about, would that be something you're interested in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think that we've been an active player in FDIC deals before, but they have to make economic and strategic
sense for us. And I think those are still two variables that are important to us as we think about those as potential
avenues for growth. That said, there is tremendous internal opportunities that we have today as we focused
organically on, like we mentioned earlier, change in the core here is something that's been significant to us.
The growth that we're seeing in C&I has been phenomenal here. If you look at the deposits [ph] piece (00:43:28),
we're up $8.7 billion in differentiated specialized deposits today. I think that has been significant for us, and
there's a lot of opportunity still for organic there. So, while I think there's definitely opportunities we should look at,
