Q3 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
In the third quarter of 2022, Valley reported net income of $178 million. Earnings per share of $0.34 and
annualized ROA of 1.30%. Exclusive of non-core charges, adjusted net income, EPS and ROA were $182 million,
$0.35 and 1.32% respectively. These exceptional results reflect the benefits of our asset sensitive balance sheet
and our consistently strong credit results.
As you are aware, Valley has undergone a meaningful evolution over the last few years by expanding in terms of
both size and capability we have uniquely positioned ourselves as one of the premier service oriented commercial
banks in the entire country. From a size perspective, we sit in an incredibly strong position with only a handful of
nationwide peers. Our customers have access to the robust suite of products and services they would find at a
large bank but with Valley's exceptional responsiveness and high touch approach. This combination has
accelerated our brand awareness and enabled us to selectively add top level talent and desirable clients. This
unique approach also positions us to capitalize on market disruption that may occur as a result of future economic
volatility.
While we remain selective with regards to how and when we grow, we believe that times of stress can create
exceptional customer acquisition opportunities. As the pool of banks that look like Valley continue to shrink, we
are prepared to maintain our momentum and maximize our competitive advantages.
One of Valley's distinguishing characteristics is our positioning in some of the country's most attractive
commercial markets, including Metro New York, Florida and California. We believe these markets will weather
economic downturns while providing unique opportunities for diversified loan and deposit growth. Our results this
quarter reflect the benefits of our diversified business model and the economic strength of our targeted markets of
operations.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to briefly update you on the guidance we had previously provided. On
page 4 of the deck, we compare selected third quarter results to last quarter's guidance. While we are not formally
adjusting our near-term guidance, we believe that the loan growth and net interest income is likely to exceed our
prior expectations. Meanwhile, the guidance for our efficiency ratio and tax rates remain unchanged.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom and Mike to discuss this quarter's growth and financial results.

Thank you, Ira. Slide 5 illustrates the quarter's 15% annualized loan growth which is below the mid-20% organic
growth rate from the second quarter. While loan originations slowed during the third quarter, net growth is above
the high end of our anticipated range as a result of two key factors, first, as interest rates have increased faster
than anticipated, payoffs have slowed dramatically; second, contributions from the residential and consumer
portfolios exceeded expectations, partially as a result of cross-sell to legacy Leumi customers.
On the commercial side, our growth remains well diversified across asset classes and geographies. We have
selectively tightened underwriting standards, which led to lower loan-to-values and higher debt service coverages
on originations during the quarter. We also continue to see a significant amount of loan production to repeat
customers. These borrowers are sophisticated and well known to Valley and come back to us, time and again, to
benefit from our responsiveness and strong execution.
As Ira mentioned, we have continued to add talented commercial bankers across our footprint. This is consistent
with our proven ability to enhance our franchise, particularly in times of disruption around us. These efforts should

help us offset a broader slowdown in demand and be additive to our loan and deposit production in 2023 and
beyond.
Finally, on slide 5, you can see the 113 basis point increase in average new origination yields to 5.21% during the
quarter. As you would expect, origination yields increased each month as market rates moved higher. This is a
positive indicator that we are able to pass through higher rates to our borrowers, and we anticipate that origination
yields will continue to ascend.
Turning to slide 6. You can see that deposits grew at an annualized rate of approximately 13% during the quarter.
As we have previously discussed, we have devoted significant resources to diversifying our deposit gathering
channels over the last few years. While certain of our funding sources have become more competitive, we've
been able to tap other customer segments and business lines to fund our loan growth.
As an example, we have seen private banking customers take advantage of higher rates by redeploying deposits
into the treasury securities market. To offset this and support growth, we rolled out retail CD promotions over the
summer, which generated over $1 billion of new deposits. These promotions were timed in advance of Fed hikes
and have added duration at rates that are extremely attractive in retrospect. We continue to focus on the deposit
side and acknowledge that each Fed hike brings more pricing and competition. We are tactically managing our
business lines to ensure that we generate deposits in the most cost-effective manner to support our loan growth.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn to provide more insight on the quarter's financials.

Thank you, Tom. Slide 7 illustrates Valley's recent quarterly net interest income and margin trends. Net interest
income increased over $35 million, or over 8% from the linked quarter. The increase reflects continued loan
growth and the benefits of our asset-sensitive balance sheet and a rising interest rate environment. These factors
more than offset a sequential reduction in PPP income and PCD accretion, which fell to $8.5 million and $12.1
million in the second quarter. This was primarily the result of slower acquired loan payoffs.
Our third quarter fully tax equivalent net interest margin increased 17 basis points to 3.60% from the second
quarter of 2022. Asset yields expanded 54 basis points during the quarter which more than offset a 40 basis point
increase in total funding costs. The asset yield increase was driven by both the repricing of our floating rate loans
and a significant increase in the yields on newly originated loans.
As you saw on slide 6, we calculate a cumulative year-to-date deposit beta of approximately 20%. This is running
better than modeled so far, but as Tom noted, we acknowledge the competitive landscape and are working hard
to ensure this trend continues. Using the implied forward curve at September 30, we anticipate net interest margin
will increase further in both the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. Net interest margin results
beyond that point will be more dependent on our ability to acutely manage future deposit betas.
Moving to slide 8. We generated over $56.2 million of non-interest income for the quarter as compared to $58.5
million in the second quarter. The reduction was driven by lower gain on sale income resulting from a decline in
conforming residential loan production. Swap and other market-based revenues were generally stable during the
quarter. On the swap side, we anticipate that revenue could revert from $11 million this quarter to the high single-
digit level in the fourth quarter, should loan origination activity decline further.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
On slide 9, you can see that our total non-interest expenses were approximately $262 million for the quarter, or
approximately $254 million on an adjusted basis. The quarters adjusted expenses included $2 million charitable
contribution and higher incentive compensation accruals related to our strong financial performance. Outside of
these discrete costs, additional expense increases generally reflect the inflationary environment and the
competitive talent market. The quarter's strong revenue growth helped drive our efficiency ratio to 49.8% from the
second quarter's 50.8% level. As Ira said, we remain confident in our previous sub-50% efficiency ratio guidance
for the second half of 2022.
Turning to slide 10. You can see our asset quality trends for the last five quarters. Our allowance for credit losses
as a percentage of total loans declined to 1.10% at September 30 from 1.13% at June 30. We assessed our
portfolio in the wake of Hurricane Ian and determined there was no significant impact to our required reserves at
September 30. We continue to support our impacted customers and employees as they recover from the storm.
As a reminder, our reserve coverage remains well above the 0.89% day one reserve we established upon the
adoption of CECL in 2020. Neither our earnings and our capital levels have benefited from reserve releases,
which differentiates us from many of our peers.
During the quarter, we experienced a positive resolution of certain non-accrual credits. This resulted in nearly $6
million of net recoveries and a sequential reduction in non-accrual loans as compared to June 30. Relative to non-
accrual loans, the reserve increased to 162% from 150% at June 30.
On slide 11, you can see that tangible book value increased approximately 2% for the quarter. This was the result
of our strong earnings and a modest negative OCI impact associated with our available-for-sale securities
portfolio. Relative to peers, our OCI headwind remains manageable as a result of our smaller securities portfolio
and modest AFS exposure, which reflects our continued focus on tangible book value preservation. Tangible
common equity to tangible assets declined slightly as a result of our loan growth. Our Tier 1 ratios were stable
during the quarter and total risk base increased as a result of our successful subordinated debt offering in
September.
With that, I will turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from
Michael Perito from KBW. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I wanted to start on the deposit side. I guess, you kind of have a two tapes here. Obviously, in the quarter itself,
the betas were pretty reasonable, and you had the nice NIM expansion. But obviously the – just on a dollar basis,
the mix of growth was very CD and brokered CD heavy and some of the rate hikes were a little later in the
quarter. So I guess I'm just curious, as we look to next quarter here, how do you guys expect the mix of deposit
growth to trend? I mean, is it going to continue to be very CD and brokered CD have? Is there room for other kind
of verticals or areas to contribute more? And I guess, as a follow-up to that, I mean, depending on what you
answer there, I mean, can betas accelerate pretty meaningfully next quarter? Do you think there's still room to
kind of keep those at reasonable rates? Or how are you guys thinking about that dynamic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, Michael. It's Tom. We have, over the past few years, built a number of verticals that are growing at rates that
are a little bit higher than what our traditional core deposits are growing. And that's – those are the HOA,
cannabis, national deposit groups as well as an emphasis on our Valley Direct product. We will continue to see
growth in those areas that will outpace our traditional core. Equally important is that our relationship-driven
commercial model results in net increases in business accounts each and every quarter. Those accounts tend to
be 61% non-interest-bearing deposits.
We will continue to focus. We don't have a reliance on any single niche. We'll continue to focus on these niches –
the average deposit cost – total deposit costs for September was 73 basis points. I'll just remind everyone our
loan yields for that same month of September, we're approaching 6%. So we have a number of levers, a number
of verticals that will continue to push.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
As it relates to the betas, Mike, our modeling on a forward basis shows that we're going to have margin
expansion. Our expectation is that we'll have margin expansion in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter of
2023. Our modeling also includes a very wide range of deposit betas for those incremental costs. And even with
that, we're still showing net interest income growth full year 2022 to full year 2023. So we feel pretty good about
where we sit right now.

Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
And I just want to clarify on Tom's comment on the loan origination yields approaching 6% on the origination side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All helpful, guys. Thanks for running through that. I guess, just as a follow-up then. I mean, why – I guess, is it the
range of outcomes that keeps the NII guide from changing here? I mean, it sounds like that just based on what
you laid out, it would be a reasonably confident statement to say that you'll be above that $900 million. But
obviously, you guys didn't formally change that. So is that just uncertainty over the next three months? Or is there
any other dynamic that we should be thinking about as we model kind of the near-term NII trajectory?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
Mike, this is Travis. So no, there's confidence that the NII is going to continue to grow in the fourth quarter. I
mean, as Mike said, the margin is going to – we anticipate the margin will go higher in the fourth quarter and
again in the first quarter. So NII will continue to expand. We just didn't formally update the guidance because it
was only one quarter. I think everyone's going to be waiting to see what the 2023 guidance looks like in January.
So it's more a formality than anything else. As you saw, I mean, we were on pace with the fourth – with the third
quarter NII to be ahead of that $900 million guide, and we're growing from there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Perfect. Yes, that's what I figured. I just wanted to double check. And then just lastly, maybe a question for Mike.
Any thoughts – I mean, the efficiency ratio guidance is unchanged. You guys were just under 50% this quarter.
Quarter-on-quarter, although the expense rate stepped up a bit. I mean, just anything you'd flag out there and as
you guys continue to invest to grow the business and the diversity of the business, I mean, any initial budgeting
thoughts on growth rate on the OpEx side for next year, even if it's just kind of qualitative commentary?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, Michael. This is Ira. I think just high level, we're really focused on generating positive operating leverage. If
you see for the quarter, we were at 1.6 times, which we think is really trending in the right direction for us and
consistent with where we've been over the last few years of how we think about growth and balancing that with
the expenses across the entire organization.
As Tom mentioned, though, we think there is going to be significant opportunity for us based on the economic
environment. We hired 20-plus frontline bankers last year on the commercial side, and we've done the same thing
so far this year. So the expense guide or as you see the expenses increase – for us, it's really in relation to what
we're seeing on the asset side of the balance sheet as well. We try not to manage any one individual component
of the financial statements and sort of independently, but rather much more so in the aggregate, and we're really
seeing the benefits of that today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. I'll let someone else come in, but thank you guys for taking my questions. Appreciate it.

Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thanks. Good morning.

Good morning, Frank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I wondered if – just a follow-up on the deposit kind of storyline. I don't know. You might even have mentioned, but
I would think it's fair to assume that just given the environment that the Bank Leumi's technology-focused deposits
would have been down quarter-over-quarter. And if that's the case, just wondering your thoughts there on trend,
could those perhaps have stabilized, which would lead to less dependence on CD growth in 4Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
On the venture tech side at Leumi, the deposits were stable for the quarter. We do expect a little bit more volatility
going into the fourth quarter, but we're optimistic and we're very proud of the long-term prospects of that business.
We expect it to be a long-term deposit growth opportunity for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
Frank, this is Travis. I mean, interestingly, the acquired Leumi business where we saw the most pressure on the
deposit side was on the private banking. Ira and Tom mentioned that in his prepared remarks, but folks that were
sitting there with deposits and no yield alternatives for multiple years and then turn around and get treasuries in
the 4% area. We saw them take deposits out and invest in the treasury market, which they do through our broker-
dealer, so we preserved the customer relationship, it could benefit economically there. But that's actually the area
that saw the pressure candidly across the organization from a deposit perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got you. Okay. And are you still seeing kind of that story play out here in the fourth quarter?

Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
I think there'll be near-term volatility in those portfolios as rate rise and such. But again, long-term, it's still a very
important and solid business for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, and I would just add to that, that even though you see the rotation out of non-interest-bearing, which many
of the peers have experienced as well, the stability of the other verticals that we built have really weathered the
storm for us on that rotation, and that goes back to Travis' comments in the wealth space as well. The money that
was at zero is a little longer sleepy, and it's going to start earning some rate of interest. The thing we're most
excited about is through the cycle right now for total deposits our beta is only 20%. So I mean, I'm not saying it's
going to be 20% in the fourth quarter, please don't make that jump, but 20% through the cycle right now,
considering the history of our company when we had a different balance sheet mix, I think, is pretty doggone good
performance at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Well, thinking about the CD promotions, I think they were – correct me if I'm wrong, but sort of done at an
opportune time earlier in the third quarter. I'm just kind of curious if you could talk about is there any sort of similar
promotions going on currently? And kind of what's the pricing there that you're seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, we have a promotion now for 19 months, 3.5% on the CD, and we're seeing a lot of positive activity began
a little over a week ago. We also have a Valley Direct product, a high-yield savings at around 3.01%, and in the
last quarter, we opened up over 1,000 new accounts there. So we are seeing traction at rates that give us a little
more duration and there will be attractive rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And Frank, as a reminder to your comment around what we've done opportunistically before Fed increases.
We've raised over $1 billion on two other CD promotions at rates less than 2.5%. So that's one of those things
that's really been helping to buoy our overall deposit beta.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. Okay. And then if I just could sneak in one last one on the expense side as well. Is there any reason to sort
of as we look at the fourth quarter, I know you provided your guide and under 50%. We're very confident in terms
of the efficiency ratio. Just wondering if there's any reason to think some of those accruals in the quarter might
have been a little bit front-loaded. I guess, is the 3Q a pretty good run rate expectation, all else equal as we go
into the fourth quarter here.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
Sure. Appreciate the question. I'm going to direct everybody's attention on the call to slide 9 in the deck. As a
reminder, the adjusted expenses are $254 million for the quarter. And if you back out the $2 million that we talked
about for the charitable contribution, which obviously, we don't expect that to continue in the fourth quarter, you
start to look at the other increases. And the good news, I think, from our perspective, it goes back to the
comments that Tom made earlier about hiring new producers within our company, the majority of that cost
increase is in the salary and compensation-related lines. So to the extent that there's recessionary pressure there,
which I think everybody is experiencing, I think it's fair to say that that's right. I think a kind of base rate going
forward, at least for the fourth quarter, expenses is $250 million, and then you can build your growth on top of that
relative to a sub-50% efficiency ratio.

Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think there's so much opportunity for us to really continue the growth trajectory of the organization. And I think
the best use of our capital is to continue to leverage it into the balance sheet and provide capital for the loan
originations internally. So I think that's probably more likely than a share repurchase at this point.

Yeah, there was a single construction loan that moved into the non-accrual bucket. The collateral is fine. We have
guarantees on it. We don't expect any loss there. In total, our non-accruals declined from 72 basis points to 65
basis points. And that was all due to positive resolution of some older loans that we had on the books with
primarily full repayment on each of them.

to the pandemic, you were about mid-20% mix of non-interest-bearing now that's about mid-30s. Where do you
see this level normalizing to, and could we go below 30%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
As a reminder, in September of 2021, I believe we were around 34%, give or take, 32%, sorry, and we peaked in
the prior quarter at just under 37%, and now we're at 34%. So we feel pretty good about the retention that we've
seen here. I think what you're seeing in our numbers and you're probably seeing in other banks numbers is, at
some point on the interest rate cycles, especially in this cycle, there's a place where people are no longer going to
leave as much in non-interest-bearing as they did before. So it's about effective use of their capital, mostly relates
back to the commercial space. So we feel pretty good about how we've been able to hold our own in that space.
But in any event, if some of that money moves to us, we're not losing those accounts. So as Tom mentioned
earlier, our account basis in the commercial space has gone up.

I think just from a more broad perspective, Steve, the composition of the balance sheet has changed dramatically
since then, much more focused on the commercial deposit versus the consumer deposit. And as you know, those
carry higher non-interest-bearing deposits from an operating account and payroll account perspective, as well as
just the shift in bringing in Leumi and what their funding base look like as well. So, I don't anticipate at all going
back down to those levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So could we read into this that you think you could maintain about mid-30s about where you are now, so
the mix doesn't change that much moving forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think there's a lot of pressure externally. You saw $200 billion flow out of the banking space. So, I think there is
going to be some pressure. I think the diversified funding mix that we've created here is really providing us the
ability to continue the growth without having to look to the borrowings market – marketplace.
That said, I think the beta isn't going to be much less than what they were last time. And Steve, if you look at – we
had 20% impact in beta this quarter just because of the growth that we put on. So I think on a core basis, as Tom
was referring to, we are getting the real benefit of the diversified funding book. The retail branches are doing well
all across the individual geographies and the focus on the commercial customer versus maybe the [ph] CRE
(27:52) customer is really supporting balances as well.
Our commercial customers give us between 25% and 35% balances that come along with that growth. If you look
back to when we had – I think as you were referencing earlier, when we were in the mid-20s, 60% of the balance
sheet was – excuse me, yes, 60% of the balance sheet now is sitting with fixed and 40% on the adjustable side,
and that was really switched from where we were before. So we've seen significant – did I get that wrong?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
You got it wrong.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
The other way, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
60% is adjustable. 40% is fixed and within the adjustable portion, 40% of that would re-price in the next three
months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Right. So that massive shift...

...the total portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yes. So that massive shift in asset base reflects the change in the deposit composition as well that really comes
along with it. So on a macro basis, it's a much more asset-sensitive balance sheet and the funding structure looks
much better as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Ira, if we put this together, what should we assume for the through-the-cycle deposit beta for you guys?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I don't think I want to give guidance on that specifically, but I think it's going to be much better than what we were
historically, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
We won't give guidance, but I will say this, Steven. On the low end of our modeling at 27% beta to the high-end in
our modeling of 87%, and we have all kinds of points in between there our net interest income still grows on a
year-over-year basis. So we feel very confident right now that we're going to continue to grow margin in the fourth
quarter and the first quarter, as we said in our prepared remarks, it's a little murkier after that. But on a net interest
income perspective, the numbers look solid.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then one final one for me. Just given the inverted curve and rising deposit costs, how should we think
about holding residential mortgage loans beyond this year? Should we expect that to continue?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
No. Steven, just your point of reference, we're only holding jumbo mortgages in portfolio. There was a small
portion of conforming that closed too late in the third quarter, about $20 million, to be sold in the third quarter, they
will be sold in the fourth quarter. So we continue to only hold jumbos, not conforming.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Not conforming, okay. Thanks for taking my questions.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I was hoping for a little bit more guidance on accretable yield that came down this quarter, I think to $8.5 million.
I'm just curious what we should be using on a run rate basis there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, Matt, this is Travis. So we were at $12 million last quarter, $8.5 million this quarter. The reduction is
because payoffs slowed dramatically. I mean, I think anywhere in that range is reasonable if you want to pick the
mid-point, I think that's fine. With where rates are, maybe you use the $8.5 million for the next few quarters, but I
don't anticipate that it would move significantly lower than this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then thinking back historically, Valley has operated more or less in a kind of interest rate neutral
position. Curious, over time, will you look to go back to that kind of interest rate position, perhaps lock in some of
these that the margin gains you've had more recently? Or do you expect to maintain the asset-sensitive position?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yes, it's Mike. Thanks for the question, Matt. Yes, we are currently exploring some options to lock in some of that,
as you said, new interest income or some of that margin that we've gained during this upward rate environment.
So, we are looking at that. And I do think, over time, you would see us migrate back to a somewhat more neutral
balance sheet position.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then just tying two thoughts together, right? You had mentioned NIM expansion through the early part
of 2023 plus perhaps locking some of this in – the extent we see some NIM pressure on the back of the Fed
stopping hikes. To what extent might we see that pressure? Or do you expect it to be more of a stabilizing point
versus real pressure?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, Matt, this is Travis. So, I mean, our margins at 3.60% this quarter, right, we're up from about 3.15% or so
two quarters ago, that's significant increase in the last two quarters. We're going to grow for another two quarters,
although likely at I think a slower pace than what you've seen so far. But then even when you see the pressure,
right, I think we all believe that we're going to see our margin even out somewhere well above kind of that low 3%
level. So maybe it's not the 3.60% area that we would ultimately level out following the conclusion of the Fed
hikes, but I think the margin is going to stabilize at a higher level than what you've seen historically for this
company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And I'm sorry, did you provide a – was there a number in there like a 3.50% or 3.60% number you think it
will stabilize at?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
I was just using this quarter's 3.60% like the reference points, we're going to grow two more quarters. And then at
some point, if you see the pressure, I mean, I think you're going to normalize in this kind of mid-3% level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. Last one for me, just on fee income. Any sort of guidance there. I know there's a number of different
business lines now kind of working. Curious if that kind of $55 million, $56 million range is a good one going
forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, we feel pretty good about that range right now. I mean, obviously, the resi mortgage business is going to
continue to be challenged as it was in the quarter. But yes, we think that's probably in the ballpark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. Okay. That's all I had. Thanks for taking my questions.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just a couple of follow-ups. Ira, question for you. In your – early in your prepared comments, I think you used the
term times of stress, give you opportunities to grow. Does this feel like a time of stress, for you? And it sounds like
you've got some opportunities to grow, but help us understand that word stress?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think it's beginning to feel like it. You're seeing definitely some contraction in GDP, overall. I think there's still
inflationary pressures that are being addressed obviously by the Fed. But you look at the balance sheet, right, and
people are migrating deposits outside of traditional financial banks, which is impacting, obviously, the ability to
fund. But that said, I think for us, specifically, the credit quality is holding up. I keep on going back to what our
performance was in the beginning of COVID. We had a significantly $30-plus billion balance sheet, and we only
had a modified $40 million of our loans during that time period really demonstrates to me the way that we
underwrote day one and the ability of our borrowers to continue to perform in a challenging economic
environment. So for us, I feel really, really good about our opportunities to continue to grow, opportunity to support
our customers and to add new customers for others, I'd be a bit concerned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then on your loan growth pace, help us understand just kind of environmental versus
market share gains. You still had a good growth quarter, and I know we talked a little bit last quarter about some
of your new markets. But is the environment healthy and is that providing opportunities or are these market share
gains? And just help us think through how you view 2023 in terms of [indiscernible] (35:49)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
What we're most proud of is that our growth is very balanced across regions, types of businesses, types of
product, types of collateral. We continue with that balanced growth, and we're seeing accelerated growth in our
newer Florida market, more so than the stable markets up here in the Midwest, and we're seeing growth in
California. We entered new markets in Philadelphia, Nashville, Atlanta, we continue to see opportunities there and
growth there. We have added – Ira mentioned, we added 25 front-end people, including three in our venture
business, two in New York, one in Palo Alto. So we're getting lift through these added people through the new
markets that we're entering and staffing into those new markets.
But I just want to stress, we've done this without compromising any credit standards. We've tightened our
underwriting standards. Our weighted average loan-to-value is around 60% on our new production. Our weighted

average debt service coverage is over 1.6. On the C&I side, it's even higher, it's over 2 times on that debt service
coverage – calculation that we have and 70% overall of our businesses to our existing customer base.
On the construction side, it's closer to 80% to existing customer base. So the balance of that growth utilizing our
existing customers, Leumi and The Westchester Bank are benefiting from a much larger balance sheet. Leumi
growth is 30% annualized and 75% is coming from existing customer base. We'll continue to see the benefit of
that. But we'll guide – our guidance is 8% to 10% growth for the fourth quarter and high single-digits for 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes. Okay. That's helpful. And then Mike, just one for you. You got a lot of questions on deposits and growth
obviously. But any cap on your loan-to-deposit ratio when you guys think through it, you've operated above 100%
in the past but how do you think about the loan-to-deposit ratio? Or is that just not a concern or limitation for you?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
We don't provide like specific guidance, but I think that when you look at us relative to the midsized bank peers in
the $50 billion to $100 billion range, I think it's advantageous for us. To the extent we can do this in a cost-
effective way and also not turn away any growth, so one of the things we want to make sure that we never do is
be in a position where we can't fund the good loan growth that Tom's team puts on day in and day out. So that
typically means that we'd like to keep at $100 billion or less. If it came up a little bit above $100 billion, it's been
much higher historically, a little bit above $100 billion, I think, would be okay. But there's not a goal to necessarily
keep it there. But assuming we can do it cost effectively, we'd like to be less than $100 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q

Hey guys, thanks. Sorry, just one last quick follow-up. The tax rate, Mike, has been creeping up a little bit. Just
wondering if you could just give us a little guidance there on where you think that will shake out in the fourth

Michael D. Hagedorn A

Remember, there are some things throughout the year the way taxes are collected, et cetera, that can give it
