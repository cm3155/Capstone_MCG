Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry
and I will take any questions you have.
I'll begin on Slide 3. In the second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.99, which included $0.10 per
share of merger and integration charges related to the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank. Excluding these
notable items, we reported earnings per share of $1.09. We achieved record net revenue this quarter totaling $6
billion. Second quarter results were highlighted by strong revenue growth driven by robust net interest income and
fee revenue and stable credit quality.
Revenue growth was driven by strong growth in earning assets and the benefit of rising rates as well as good
underlying business activity and customer acquisition trends across our fee businesses. Additionally, our
multiyear investments in digital payments and technology are paying off in the form of strong top line growth and
enhanced efficiency. This quarter, we added $150 million to our loan loss reserve, reflecting strong loan growth
and are consistent through-the-cycle approach to risk management. Our credit quality remains strong and we are
not seeing any trends in early-stage metrics that cause us concern.
At June 30, our CET1 capital ratio was 9.7%. Based on the results of the Federal Reserve's 2022 stress test that
were published in June, we announced that we expect to be subject to a preliminary stress capital buffer of 2.5%,
unchanged from the current level. We believe our industry-leading results demonstrate our ability to withstand a
severe economic downturn, which is a testament to the strength, quality and diversity of our balance sheet and
our prudent approach to managing risk.
Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, our return on average assets was 1.16% and
our return on average common equity was 15.3%. Our return on tangible common equity was 20.5% on a core
basis. Slide 5 highlights digital trends in engagement.
I'll now turn to slide 6. We believe our digital capabilities and our complete payments ecosystem are competitive
advantages that will drive meaningful profit and return differentiation for our company over the next several years.
Our state-of-the-art digital capabilities have not only created a more effective and valuable experience for our
customers, but they have allowed us to expand our distribution reach beyond our physical infrastructure while
optimizing our existing branch network.
On the left side, you will see that – the success we are having with our State Farm partnership, which is driving
more customers, more loans and more deposits to our platform in a cost-effective way.
The chart in the middle highlights the strong trends – the uptake of our talech point-of-sale functionality, which
allows small business customers to manage their banking and payments' needs in a simple, easy-to-use format
that we provide in the form of a dashboard.
And on the right, you'll see the momentum we are gaining in real-time payments transactions which, through the
midyear 2022, are 10 times higher than the total number of transactions we saw for the entirety of 2020.
We are excited about the secular growth opportunities we see across all of our business lines, but I'd like – but
one area I'd like to highlight on slide 7 is our business banking initiative, which is really starting to gain traction. On
the left chart, you'll see that the opportunity we have previously discussed to connect our banking customers with
our payments, products and services; and our payments customers with our banking products and services.

The chart on the right shows the progress we are making in growing accounts and expanding wallet share.
Growth in relationships with both banking and payments products has meaningfully outpaced growth in total
relationships over the past 12 months. And it's worth noting, we are still in the early innings.
Now let me turn the call over to Terry who'll provide more detail on the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Andy. If you turn to slide 8, I'll start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of second
quarter earnings trends. Average loans increased 3.6% compared to the first quarter, driven by a 6.9% growth in
commercial loans, 4.1% growth in credit card and 3.6% growth in mortgage loans.
Commercial loan growth reflected increased business activity and higher utilization rates across both large
corporate and middle market portfolios. Pipelines are strong going into the third quarter, and working capital
needs remain elevated.
In the retail portfolio, we saw good growth in credit card balances, reflecting strong spending activity and typical
seasonal trends. Purchased mortgage, market share gains and lower prepayment activity continue to support
residential mortgage balance growth.
Turning to slide 9, total average deposits increased by 0.5% compared with the first quarter. Growth in interest-
bearing deposits more than offset the impact of lower balances of non-interest-bearing deposits, reflecting the
rising interest rate environment. Total average deposits increased by 6.4% compared with a year ago.
Slide 10 shows credit quality trends, which continue to be strong across our loan portfolios. The ratio of
nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.23% at June 30 compared with 0.25% at March 31,
and 0.36% a year ago.
Our second quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.20% improved slightly versus the first quarter level of 0.21%, and was
lower compared with the second quarter of 2021 level of 0.25%. Credit performance across our commercial and
retail portfolios continues to be strong.
On a linked-quarter basis, both early and late-stage delinquencies decreased for the total portfolio. Our allowance
for credit losses as of June 30 totaled $6.3 billion or 1.88% of period-end loans.
Slide 11 provides an earnings summary. In the second quarter, we reported $1.09 per diluted share, excluding
$0.10 per share of merger and integration charges related to the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank.
Turning to slide 12. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $3.5 billion, representing an
8.3% increase compared with the first quarter and a 9.5% increase from a year ago. Linked quarter growth was
driven by strong earning asset growth and a 15 basis point increase in the net interest margin.
Slide 13 highlights trends in non-interest income. Non-interest income grew 6.3% on a linked-quarter basis but
declined by 2.7% from a year ago as lower mortgage banking revenue more than offset strong performance in
other fee businesses. The decline in mortgage banking revenue primarily reflected lower refinancing activity in the
market, which continues to pressure total application volumes and related gain on sale margins.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
In the second quarter, total payment fee revenue increased by 9.7% compared with the year earlier, reflecting
strong underlying business trends supported by investments we are making.
Slide 14 provides linked-quarter and year-over-year revenue growth trends for our three payments businesses.
Because of the cyclical nature of our payments businesses, we believe year-over-year trends are a better
indicator of underlying business performance in a normal environment.
Credit and debit card revenue increased to 0.8% on a year-over-year basis as the impact of higher credit and
debit card volume was offset by lower prepaid card activity. Excluding prepaid card revenue, credit and debit card
revenue – fee revenue would have increased 10.1% compared with the second quarter of 2021.
Year-over-year credit and debit card revenue growth rates continue to be negatively impacted by the decline in
prepaid card revenue as the benefit of government stimulus has dissipated. We provide detail on prepaid card
revenue over the past five quarters in the upper right-hand quadrant. While prepaid card revenue is approaching
a run rate on a linked-quarter basis, it will impact year-over-year credit and debit card revenue comparisons
through the end of 2022.
The bottom half of the slide illustrates the strong year-over-year growth rates in both merchant processing and
corporate payment fee revenue over the past – last several quarters. While we expect the year-over-year growth
rates to moderate from current levels, we continue to believe that both merchant processing and credit – and
corporate payment fee revenue can grow at a high single-digit pace on a year-over-year basis in a post-pandemic
environment.
Slide 15 provides some additional information on our payment services businesses. On the right side of the slide,
you can see that the strong momentum we are seeing in tech-led revenue growth within our merchant acquiring
business. In the second quarter, tech-led merchant revenue, which accounted for 27% of the total merchant
acquiring revenue, was 13% higher than a year ago and 43% higher than the comparable 2019 period.
A key to that trajectory is the strong growth we have seen in new tech-led partnerships. In the second quarter,
new tech-led partnerships totaled 1.6 times the number of new partnerships we acquired for the entire year of
2019, and we continue to add to that customer distribution baseline.
Turning to Slide 16. Non-interest expense increased by 0.7% on a linked quarter basis, excluding merger and
integration costs associated with the pending acquisition of Union Bank. The change in expense was driven by
higher compensation expense, marketing and business development expense and other noninterest expenses,
partially offset by lower employee benefit expense and other expense categories. The higher compensation
expense was driven by the impact of seasonal merit increases and one additional day in the quarter as well as
variable compensation tied to revenue growth.
Slide 17 highlights our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at June 30 was 9.7%. As a
reminder, at the beginning of the third quarter of 2021, we suspended our share buyback program due to the
pending acquisition of Union Bank. After the closing of the acquisition, we expect to operate at a CET1 capital
ratio of approximately 8.5%. We continue to expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until our
CET1 ratio reaches 9.0% following the pending deal close.
On slide 18, I'll now provide some forward-looking guidance for US Bank on a stand-alone basis. This guidance
does not include any potential impact from Union Bank. Let me start with the full year 2022 guidance. We have
5


U.S. Bancorp

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
updated our interest rate expectations to be consistent with the market expectations. We continue to expect total
net revenue to increase 5.6% (sic) [5% to 6%] (13:16) compared with 2021.
Given our revised interest rate assumptions, we now expect low to mid-teen growth in taxable equivalent net
interest income compared with our previous estimate of 8% to 11%. We expect higher rates to pressure mortgage
application volumes more than previously anticipated, which will negatively impact our mortgage banking
revenue. We now expect fee income to be slightly lower for the full year of 2022 compared with our previous
expectation that fee revenue would be stable.
We continue to expect positive operating leverage of at least 200 basis points in 2022, excluding the impact of
merger and integration-related costs associated with the Union Bank transaction. For the full year of 2022, we
expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 22%.
Now, I'll provide guidance for the third quarter. We expect total revenue to grow 3% to 5% on a linked-quarter
basis. In the third quarter, we expect linked quarter noninterest expense growth up 2.3% (sic) [2% to 3%] (14:31)
excluding merger and integration-related costs, as we prepare for the Union Bank transaction.
Credit quality remains strong. Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than
historical levels, but will continue to normalize over time. Adjustments to our loan loss reserve in the near term will
primarily reflect loan growth and changes in the economic outlook.
If you turn to slide 19, I'll provide an update on our previously announced pending acquisition of Union Bank. In
September of 2021, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the core regional
banking franchise of MUFG Union Bank. We continue to make significant progress in planning for closing the deal
in the second half of 2022 while we await regulatory approval. As you know, regulatory approvals are not within
the company's control and may impact the timing of the closing of a deal.
As a reminder, we expect to close on the deal approximately 45 days after being granted US regulatory approval.
Because this timing would likely indicate a late third quarter or early fourth quarter close, we believe it is prudent
to shift the system conversion date to the first half of 2023. The financial merits of the deal remain intact. Our
original EPS accretion estimates are unchanged, and we continue to estimate the acquisition will generate an
internal rate of return of approximately 20%, which is well above our cost of capital.
I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Terry. Our second quarter results were supported by solid account growth, deepening of existing
relationships and strong business activity across our banking and fee business lines, and we are well positioned
as we head into the second half of the year. Credit quality remains strong and we continue to prudently manage
operating expenses even as we invest in our digital initiatives, our payments capabilities and in our technology
modernization.
In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for all they do, and we look forward to welcoming Union Bank
employees to our company. I remain confident in the strategic and financial merits of this transaction and the
meaningful benefits that will accrue to our customers, our communities as well as our shareholders.
We will now open up the call to Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question comes from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. [ph] I was hoping (17:20)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Apologies if I missed any of this in the prepared remarks, but – so, it was nice to see overall deposits up a bit. The
mix is changing just a bit as you go forward, I guess. But maybe thoughts on major sort of what you would expect
in overall deposit balance as we go forward, how the mix might change, and any thoughts on what you're seeing
with pricing pressures on funding costs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Scott. Certainly, with the quantitative tightening that's taking place, I think the growth rates with respect to
deposits in the industry will be relatively stable or maybe even down a little bit. But our expectation, at least in the
near term, is that, overall, deposit balances will be fairly stable for us. We have a lot of sources of deposits,
including our corporate trust and the mix between our money market funds and our on balance sheet.
From a mix standpoint, as you would expect and what we have seen both for us and in the industry, is that the
mix starts to change when rates rise. And so, we are starting to see the mix between noninterest-bearing and
interest-bearing start to change with a shift out of noninterest-bearing balances into interest-bearing sort of
categories as people are looking [ph] and (18:40) seeking sort of yield.
And then when we think about deposit pricing, it's been relatively low for the first rate cycle or rate hikes that we
have seen. And in fact, it's – for us, we've actually outperformed our expectations, which is good to see and which
is a reflection, in part, because we have higher level of consumer balances today than we did, for example, four,
five years ago, et cetera.
But when we get into the next 125 basis points, so if you think about the next two rate hikes that the market is
expecting, our expectations, deposit betas will probably be in that low to mid-30s, kind of in that ballpark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's terrific color. And I appreciate [ph] that (19:35). So, thank you very much Terry. Maybe a separate
question. Can you walk through any updated thoughts on sort of the capital ramifications from the pending
7

transaction? I guess just a lot has changed in terms of both possible credit and certainly rate environment. Just
curious to hear any thoughts that you have insofar as you're able to give while it's still pending.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think that right now, the capital implications are in line. Certainly, with a rising rate environment, the mark-
to-market is a little bit more than what we maybe had modeled in the original deal. But once you close that
transaction, it accretes back into income pretty fast.
Our expectation, as I said, is that CET1 will be somewhere around 8.5% at the time of closing. Of course, that will
be dependent upon where rates are at that particular point in time. But the transaction accretes pretty quickly. So
we do expect capital to continue to grow and accrete after the transaction. Andy, what would you add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
The only thing I'd add, Terry, is that – as you talked about in your comments, we're making significant [ph]
process (20:43) in planning for the closing of the deal, which we, as we talked about, now expect in the second
half. We targeted a second half conversion last time we talked and now – and it was going to be Veterans Day.
Given now that we're coming upon a little later close, we're moving the conversion day to President's Day
weekend. So that's what our planning assumption is for all the teams working on this. That's that next three-day
weekend.
And as Terry mentioned, our financial targets that we initially articulated are still intact, although the timing of the
cost savings might be a little different, the synergies are still $900 million. And Terry, maybe you can talk about,
given the rate environment, the accretion dilution [ph] for this deal (21:28).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Again, the accretion – when you think about the earnings per share accretion, we still feel very comfortable
with respect to the 6% accretion in 2023. A couple of different things, obviously, the timing will affect our ability to
achieve all of the cost synergies that we expected in 2023.
And so of the $900 million that Andy talked about, our expectation is we'll probably achieve 50% to 60% of that
next year. But what's offsetting that is with the rising rate environment, we're going to see stronger revenue that
will help to offset that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Right. That's perfect. Andy and Terry, thank you guys very much.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Hi, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hi, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
On the payments revenues and the merchant revenue, I know you had indicated that you do expect these
revenues on a year-over-year basis to moderate here, but as you see high single-digit year-over-year growth is
reasonable post-pandemic.
So just to understand that a little more in terms of the coming quarters over the next several quarters, that
moderation that you see, is that going to going to put you in that high single-digit range? Or do you expect growth
to be lower than that high single-digit year-over-year range in coming quarters as payments volumes moderate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So our expectation, when we get to more of a normal environment is that payments would have the high
single-digits sort of growth rate. So it's a continuation of the business. The growth rates that we're talking about in
terms of moderating year-over-year is really [ph] from the (23:21) very high growth rates that we saw post
pandemic as the cyclical recovery occurred, but think of payments in the high single-digits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Got it. So then in the moderation, is there a way you can maybe help characterize what type of level do you
think is reasonable in coming quarters as the moderation takes hold?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think part of it, in terms of moderating of growth rates, part of it is we'll start to see from 2022 to 2023 kind
of getting into a more normal environment. So I think that it's still probably a little bit of a higher level when we
think about the third quarter or the near quarters, but certainly, as we get into 2023, I think it moderates to that
high-single digits.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. I got you. Got it. And then, just on the credit front, clearly, you guys are certainly in the – more – generally –
historically, more conservative standpoint. How – can you maybe talk a little bit more how you're thinking about
the loan loss reserve here particularly from a CECL perspective? As you're dialing in the scenarios, you have to
assume the economic scenarios are going to get worse incrementally here given the Fed actions. So how do you
see that impacting your reserving here just from a scenario standpoint and given the CECL requirements?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Maybe as a reminder, when we end up looking at scenarios, we look at five different potential scenarios
from a baseline to something that's slightly better to something that's worse and as severe maybe as a more
severe recession. So I think about that range.
For some time, there's been an uncertainty if you think about Ukraine now. And when we end up looking at the
different economic and we weight those assumptions, we're really weighting to a little bit more of a downside
scenario relative to that baseline. We are trying to take the economic situation into consideration. So I feel like
we're in a pretty good spot in terms of how we are thinking about it.
And what I would say, John, is that at least in the near term, think about the second half of this year, growth in –
or changes, I think, in the loan loss reserve will probably be driven more by loan growth than anything else.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay, got it. So you don't necessarily, over the next couple quarters, see an outright build related to the economic
backdrop based upon the forecast that you're looking at now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
I think it will be more driven by loan growth than our scenarios weightings getting worse, at least not measurably
worse.
[indiscernible] (26:19)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Right, right. Okay. And then, one more related to that. I guess just as economic scenarios do intensify and if a
build does begin to moderate, I mean, any way to just longer term help us think about the magnitude? I mean, we
just had another – one of your competitors talk about how the pandemic-related reserve levels may not be
applicable to where the banks built the pandemic-related reserves to. Would you agree with that, that the
pandemic-related reserve levels were probably overly draconian?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
Yeah. It was as you kind of went through the pandemic it was hard to know exactly where the economy was
going. So I do think that the, level of reserve builds were pretty aggressive. And rightfully so at that particular point
in time based upon what we knew.
I think that as we see the next economic recession kind of develop, again, John, we try to manage through the
cycle and our underwriting is strong and all those sorts of things. So while there'll be reserve build certainly from
an economic outlook point of view, I don't think it's going to be anywhere near what it was as a result of the
pandemic.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Terry, to follow up on credit quality, can you share with us – certainly, I'm with you, I don't see the reserves
needing ever to get close to what you guys had to do during the pandemic when unemployment went to 14.5%,
and we had an annualized rate of decline in the second quarter GDP in 2020 of over 35%.
But can you share with us in the rate stress testing for your commercial customers or anybody on variable rate
loans, at what point do rising rates really start to give you guys a little discomfort? Is it at 200 or 300 basis points
higher? Any color there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I think what drives loan activity, more than anything, is the economic growth and GDP. And I think from a rate
scenario standpoint, in terms of credit risk, if you think about the defense side, Gerard, I think we underwrite to a
higher rate environment for variable rate loans. So I think we've already taken that into account. And we look at
cash flows under different rate scenarios as we think about putting those loans on the book. So we're less – I'm
less concerned about rising rates impacting credit. I do think rising rates, as that impacts the economy, will impact
loan growth at some point.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
No. Okay. Very fair. And then, I guess, as a follow-up, sticking with credit, it seems like in past cycles, excluding
2020, there was a gradual lead in to the downturns, and we – I think many of us could have seen what was going
on in the aggressive lending of 2006 going into 2008, 2009 or 1988, 1989 going into 1990. We don't seem to have
that this time.
So can you guys – I don't know if you can give us any further color on what is it that the market is so – seems like
so concerned about with banks, that we're going to hit a brick wall or go off a cliff on credit possibly in 6 to 12
months. Any further thoughts there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I do think it's – banks are a reflection of all the customers that we serve and to the extent the recession
impacts those customers, it'll impact us. And I think that's why you're seeing bank stocks – usually when rates go
up, bank stocks outperform. Bank's rates – we've been waiting for a while for rates to go up. They're finally going
up and bank stocks are going the other way. And I think it's that fear of recession for all the reasons we've talked
about.
And as I've talked about, Gerard, I think we are preparing for any scenario because the range of scenarios – and I
talked about this before – is as wide as I've ever seen it in my career. The probability of different events occurring,
there's a lot of uncertainty out there, a lot of inputs into things that we've never had before. And I think all that
uncertainty just translates into people being careful and a little prudent in terms of their investments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And with that, are your customers seeing any clear evidence of the slowdown from the tightening that's already
gone on? Or is it still – are the customers still in pretty good shape in terms of their businesses, generally
speaking?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Maybe a couple different things that certainly we watch. I mean from a consumer spend standpoint, it
continues to be very strong and that obviously is what businesses are seeing now that consumer spend is shifting
a bit in terms of where it's occurring. It's less discretionary, certainly more non-discretionary on food and fuel and
those types of things. It is probably shifting away from a lot of the retail purchases toward service-related type of
activities. But the overall level of spend is still pretty strong.
I would also say that the consumer balance sheet is strong. They still have deposit balances that are in excess of
where they were pre-pandemic. I think in part, that's allowing, at least on the average, for that consumer to spend
to continue. And then they're willing to draw down on their credit card lines as well.
On the business side, the way that I would characterize it is we're continuing to see inventory builds. I think that
part of the loan growth that we're seeing or experiencing may be businesses trying to get ahead of inflation a bit in
terms of acquiring inventory today as opposed to something that might have a 10%, 20%, 30% rate increase.

The one thing I would say though, Gerard, is that I think that business owners, especially in the middle market
space, are just more cautious today. And it comes back to what Andy said, it seems like a strong economy today,
but the range of possibilities is very wide. And so people are trying to take that into consideration when they think
about running their business.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Just a new clarification questions for my first one. Terry, you mentioned that deposit beta could be in the
low to mid-30s for the next 125 basis points. Can we interpret that in terms of the cumulative beta by fourth
quarter? Does that mean that will be the cumulative beta by the fourth quarter or does that mean that the
cumulative beta would be lower than that range by fourth quarter because we have to take into account the first
100 basis points?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
It would be lower – I mean, the average, obviously, would be less. So what I'm really talking about is the next two
rate hikes and what we would see in terms of deposit betas in reaction to that. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. I'm just comparing it to a peer that reported also today, I think they mentioned that the cumulative beta
would be in the low 30s by year-end. And it sounds like, based on the math, you could outperform that.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
Certainly, in terms of what we are experiencing, the deposit betas in the first rate hikes has been lower than what
we had expected. I think from just in terms of the industry and where we were starting from, the betas for us, at
least, have been lower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And Andy, maybe taking a step back and asking more of an industry question. Clearly, the market's
very worried about a recession. And clearly, the market accepts that US Bank has one of the best quality balance
sheets out there. The bank has spent a lot of time building their corporate market share.
I guess my first question to you is, as you think about the relative resilience of banks, potentially, in a recession
like Gerard alluded to, and the amount of sort of lost market share to nonbanks, do you see some of that coming
back to – that market share coming back to the industry generally, and US Bank specifically? Or was some of that
credit quality never something that you wanted to underwrite and put on the books to begin with?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
It's a good question, Erika. I think there is a little bit of a shift already occurring and what you're seeing in some of
the nonbank competitors. First of all, the banking industry is in terrific shape from a capital liquidity just from a
defensive standpoint, much better than we were during the last downturn, and that includes US Bank. And you
saw our results of the stress test, which showed us performing very well in a very stressful environment. And I
think that's a reflection of all those things, including our diversity in our credit underwriting discipline.
I do think traditional credit models work through cycles. Sometimes new credit models work when things are going
well and are a little more challenged when things aren't going so well. So we'll see how those new credit models
and new ways of doing underwriting will work in this downturn. But I do think that banks and certainly US Bank's
models have been proven through multiple cycles.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And my third question is, I think that most of the Street subscribes to the idea that payments is going to be a
secular winner for US Bank. There's clearly a debate right now on how weak does the consumer get in a
downturn. Nobody's worried really about credit surprises in the consumer with US Bank. But how should we think
about the range of outcomes in payments activity and spend if we do have a recession?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Erika, it depends on how severe that recession is, certainly. But as Terry alluded to, what we're seeing is
the consumer is still in a very good position. They have a lot of cushion. We have $2.5 trillion of excess savings
versus pre-pandemic levels. For US Bank, we're still at two to three times deposit level. So they're still spending
dollars that they've not spent over the past few years. And as you know, the unemployment numbers are very
good.
So, I think there's enough cushion. And I do think that, at least for the near term, that cushion will allow continued
spend activity, albeit, as Terry mentioned, in a little bit different categories, certainly from goods to services and a
little bit more in terms of non-discretionary, but we're still seeing strength there. And again, how that ultimately
comes out will depend upon those – that range of outcomes that I talked about that's pretty wide.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, good morning. So I look at slide 7, I'm trying to look at – I'm squinting on that, and that's the number of joint
business banking and payment customers relationship growth, and you have that indexed at 100 starting at
March 2021. [ph] I'm (39:23) looking at a blue line versus the green line, and this is your big effort. And so I guess
you're up – with my squinting here, you're up 5% year-over-year in the growth in accounts that use both banking
and payments. Is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
That's right, Mike. Sorry for the squinting, but yes. So if you index back to 100, we're up just under 6% on those
combined relationships that have both banking and payments products and that's almost 2x what just the total
relationships are, which would imply just single service relationships are below that green line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And so how much is this contributing to your growth? I mean, you had outsized growth in payments, slide
14. You have outsized growth in commercial loans, slide 8. So can you kind of disassemble this, like what percent
of the growth is due to this business banking and payment initiative and how much is just due to the environment,
the onboarding of the economy post-pandemic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I think it's a little bit of both. We're still, as I mentioned, in the early innings of all this. But I will tell you, Mike, that
we have a tremendous focus on this, on both the business banking segment as well as the commercial segment.
And I think this concept of weaving together banking and payment services into a comprehensive offering is going
to be meaningfully important to our growth rates, both acquiring customers and providing more products and
services [ph] to the current (41:02) customers.
And it is a one of my top priorities. It's one of the company's top priorities. It crosses many business lines. And I
do think it's driving the growth that you're seeing in both business activity as well as corporate activity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then an unrelated question. I mean, commercial loan growth is growing very strong. And what's the pricing
like on commercial loans? It just seems like there's such a disconnect between the capital markets, which is
charging so much more for credit and the bank lending markets, which might be charging more but not nearly as
much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think that, Mike, in the commercial side, corporate loan side of the equation, it's still pretty competitive
from a pricing point of view. And so, I would tend to agree in the sense that credit spreads haven't widened maybe
as much as we might have expected at this particular point in time.
16


U.S. Bancorp
(USB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
And I think part of that kind of comes back to what economy are we looking at? I mean, it's – again, today, it looks
pretty good. But my expectation is, if you have this type of loan growth and the economic outlook that people are
kind of expecting, you would expect those credit spreads to be widening and spreads to be widening in our loans
more, [ph] not seeing it yet though (42:20).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So does that – I mean, you're the most conservative bank in the industry based on several metrics, bond spreads,
credit rating agencies, all that sort of thing. So as the most conservative bank in the industry, among the largest,
does that mean do you forgo some of this lending, or do you just plow ahead with the assumption that we're not
going into any sort of hard landing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
No, Mike, it's a good question as well. So Terry and myself and our leaders are being very disciplined about what
we're putting on our balance sheet. And I will tell you that while we had strong loan growth, it could have been a
heck of a lot stronger. But it wasn't because we are not putting those deals that are either not appropriate from a
credit standpoint certainly, or from a spread standpoint or return standpoint. So we are growing good loans, we
could have grown more, but we didn't.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. And perfect example, if you end up looking at the growth in auto lending for us over the last quarter or two,
those spreads have been very competitive, they have not been responsive to the rising rate environment. And
we're willing to give up some of the volume there simply because of the fact that returns are not as strong as they
should be, given the current environment. So that would be an example of the discipline we're talking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I wanted to ask about the credit marks related to the pending UB deal. Obviously, spreads have widened as was
just discussed. And just – I would think that means kind of more marks and maybe just frame how meaningful that
might be. Is there a risk that the CET1 is below 8.5%?
And then of course, on the flip side, if you're marking that book down a little bit more aggressively, maybe you're
essentially done building reserves in that portfolio even if we do get the hard landing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yes. Well, maybe from a credit mark standpoint, I think it's pretty consistent with what we had expected. I mean,
that portfolio performs pretty strong. In terms of the mark-to-market from a rate point of view, it certainly is higher
than what we had originally modeled out. That will put a little bit of pressure, as I mentioned earlier, on the day
one closing CET1 ratio, which we still expect to be around 8.5%.
It might be a little bit lower than that, but – or a little higher. It kind of just depends upon where rates are at that
point in time. But as you say, it accretes back into income pretty quickly. And so it's not really a significant concern
at this particular point in time for us.
I do think, Matt, also we talked a little bit about the timing of synergies related to the cost synergies, maybe with
the system conversion moving back being a little bit lower than what we had modeled, but the benefit of the mark-
to-market will offset that. So from an overall earnings accretion point of view, we still very – still feel very
comfortable with 6% in 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then just to summarize, so the credit marks aren't really impacted by kind of macro forecast and what we're
seeing in public markets, it's more what you're seeing in the actual portfolio as we think about the credit marks
themselves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, obviously, we have to take into consideration what our assumptions are from an economic outlook
point of view. But as I mentioned earlier, those haven't changed a lot yet at this particular point in time. And so
again, it depends upon the timing of the closing and what happens between here and then. But at least at this
particular point in time, the quality of the portfolio is good. It's performing well, et cetera. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then just separately, you talked about mortgage fees being weaker than expected in your full year
guidance. Obviously, we're seeing that for the industry overall. But any signs of the gain on sale margin
stabilizing?
And then in the servicing book, it doesn't feel like we're getting the full benefit of the slower prepayments. I know
there can be a little bit of a delay as we look across some of the banks. We're not seeing that. Is there still some
benefit from the servicing book to kick in? Thanks.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So a couple of different things. As we talked earlier, there'll continue to be pressure on mortgage banking
revenue. We think about on a linked-quarter basis, third quarter fee revenue in that area is probably going to be
pretty similar to the second quarter. But that's going to be a combination of things, Matt. I do think that there
continues to be a little bit of pressure on the volume side of the equation simply because of rising rates.
We are seeing, at least for us, the gain on sale starting to stabilize and improve a little bit. Our expectation is that
it improves as we go through the rest of the year and certainly into 2023. There's a fair amount of capacity that's
coming out of the system, out of the industry. And so I think that, that will help in terms of gain on sale.
From the servicing standpoint, at least from our point of – in terms of how we end up managing them, we try to
hedge MSR valuations pretty tightly. Obviously, the values of MSRs are improving because of that – because of
rates. And I do expect there's probably opportunity from a servicing income point of view.

Assuming the Fed hikes eventually lead to slower growth and higher unemployment as many hiking cycles have
historically, could you help us understand at what point you'd be required to increase your reserve rate because
that increase in unemployment would fall under your reasonable and supportable forecast period under CECL?
Does it just need to be more visible before you can act on it?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think there's a lot of uncertainty out there which direction it's actually going to go. I think there just needs
to be more certainty around what that economic outlook is. Again, kind of coming back to what I mentioned
earlier, Bill, we look at a whole variety of different economic outlooks. And then we weight them and we have
been, for some period of time, kind of weighting them a little bit more on the downside, expecting – because of the
uncertainty that we've been talking about in the past. So if a recession hits, we will have to adjust it, but that's
something we'll have to take into consideration at that time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. And maybe following up on that, how much of an impact would you say management overlays are
having currently? Many banks have had their reserve rates fall below their day one levels already. And there's a
view that the macro outlook today is not as favorable as it was on January 1, 2020. Just curious to what extent
overlays are being used [indiscernible] (49:35) to the extent which you'd consider using them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean I can't speak for what other people are doing. What I will speak to is that if you end up looking at the
reserve rate on day one versus today, the change in that is really probably a couple of different factors, but it's
principally the mix of the portfolio today versus what it was two years ago, both in terms of the quality of the asset,
but also where we have seen growth over the last couple of years.
ABS securities, as an example – securities lending, as an example, is very high quality. That's where we have
seen quite a bit of growth over the last couple of years. And so a lot of it's mix for us as much as anything.
I would say from an economic perspective, relative to certainly day one, it's probably more on the downside than it
was then. So it's – I mean, again, I can't speak to what other people are doing, but it's really mix-driven for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. That's helpful. And if I can squeeze in one last one. You guys have a unique view given the depth of
your consumer and commercial businesses. Maybe could you price out for us what a mild recession you think
would look like, maybe where you see the greatest risk on both the commercial and consumer side and then
specifically within USB? What that looks like [indiscernible] (51:05)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Well, Bill, I – Yeah. I think the greatest impacts will be on the low and moderate income customer base starting
there. And that's where inflation impacts the most, and that's where we're already starting to see some shift in
spend, as we talked about from discretionary to non-discretionary. And I think as that continues, that will – you'll
see more of an impact there. But the spend levels continue to be good as we talked about.
I will tell you, one change that we are seeing for the last two and a half years, every month, consumer balances,
checking and savings account balances have risen every single month. We did see sort of a flattening in the last
two months. So that's moderating for sure. So some of that excess savings certainly is not growing, but it's
20


U.S. Bancorp
(USB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
flattening and starting to be spent. So I think as that continues, that provides a cushion as we go into the next few
months, but that cushion is starting to at least flatten out. So those are the things we're seeing.
And again, as a reminder, we don't have – our portfolio is prime only. Our customer base is high quality. So I think
some of those early indicators or its early impacts will not be seen in our balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. And then on the corporate side, we have very little leverage lending. That's just not an area that we get
into. Our corporate customers are good investment-grade customers. So they have certainly the ability to
withstand, especially, a mild recession.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's super helpful. And Andy, maybe going back to your comment around the significant liquidity that the
consumers have and how that's kind of been coming down a little bit, but it's still high. Is that something that you
think perhaps is maybe contributing to the strength in the spending and potentially could be sort of inflationary in
and of itself, and lead the Fed to have to do more in terms of hiking? Just curious – just your high-level thoughts
on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think that's one of the wildcards or factors that – we talked about we're seeing things in today's
environment that we haven't seen in other downturns or recessionary impacts. And I think this is one of them. So
we had trillions of dollars of government stimulus, unemployment, and the fact that people weren't spending,
given the pandemic, for a number of quarters and years, and that built up a cushion.
And that cushion certainly is impacting spend levels because now they are using it. And that's that $2.5 trillion of
excess savings. And for us, it is that high balance that we're seeing across every level of deposits, $0 to $500,
$500 to $1,000 up to $10,000. So still well above pre-pandemic levels, but certainly flattening out. And I think that
cushion provides a little bit of time, certainly, before you start to see some of the impacts from this higher rate
environment because people are spending money they already have.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, morning. Just one quick question on Slide 15 on the payments business, Andy and Terry. So you talked
about just what might happen in the next few quarters. But talk to us, when we think about the business in the
medium to longer term, a lot of the digital native companies are struggling right now, what this means in terms of
the investments you've made over the last few years to gain market share.
Should we anticipate any kind of strategic M&A that helps you further your footprint within the payments
business? And just how that business should evolve relative – in the pie chart and the breakdown you provided
on Slide 15? Would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So I think what we talked about is building this capability, this ecosystem of banking and payments. And we've
already made a number of smaller acquisitions, talech being one of them, TravelBank being another that have
built our capabilities and thinking about helping companies manage their entire business from a receivables, a
payables standpoint, money movement, lending activity, cash flows and such.
So the acquisitions that you've seen us make is to do exactly that. That, coupled with the investments we've made
is what's driving that – what we think is a great opportunity to build relationships and build revenue within those
relationships, and that's driving to Terry's articulation of that high single-digit growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah.

Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Ebrahim, I would say that if we have a focus from an acquisition point of view in the near term, it will be something
that's very specific to a product or a capability that we're trying to fill in. But quite honestly, we feel pretty good in
terms of where we're at right now.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And would you expect that over the next year or two, you gaining market share in the business? And what I'm
trying to do is just handicap disruption risk to that business. It's something that's on the mind of investors. And it
seems like you're making good progress, but would love to hear how you think about where your market share
would be if you had to [ph] draw out (56:18) over the medium term relative to today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, I do think we have the opportunity. I think we have two great opportunities. One is we have a big slew of
banking customers – [ph] and it's in another chart (56:28) – who don't have our payments capabilities yet, and we
have – half of our payments customers don't have our banking. So we have a great opportunity to provide more
products and services to those customers. That's number one. And number two is, given the capabilities in this
ecosystem we're building, we have the opportunity to acquire more customers which, we believe, will take share.
