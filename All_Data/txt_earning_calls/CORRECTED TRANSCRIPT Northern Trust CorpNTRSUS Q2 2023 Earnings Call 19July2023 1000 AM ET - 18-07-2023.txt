Michael G. O'Grady
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Our results for the
second quarter reflect solid sequential performance. Trust fees and assets under custody and management
increased sequentially, which included positive organic growth in each business.
Net interest income was down modestly on a linked-quarter basis, reflecting higher funding costs associated with
the highly competitive deposit backdrop. Expenses, excluding unusual items, were well-controlled, reflecting the
rigor of our cost discipline, as well as the impact of various productivity initiatives. We reported $64 million in
charges in the second quarter associated with these steps.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Our Wealth Management business modestly grew Assets Under Custody and Management and trust fees on a
sequential basis. We continue to see strength in the higher wealth tiers and within our Global Family Office
segment, where we captured several marquee wins.
Our industry leadership position also set out in the quarter. We held our third annual Northern Trust Wealth
Planning Symposium, bringing together legal and financial experts to share innovative strategies and insights to
shape the future of Wealth Management. Sessions averaged more than 1,000 participants and included
attendees from North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.
We also released the second Family Office Trends report coauthored with the Wharton School. Notably, we
received a utility patent for our cloud-based goals-driven Wealth Management technology during the quarter and
were named Best Digital Innovator of the Year and Best Private Bank for Digital Wealth Planning by the Financial
Times Group.
In asset management, we saw strong flows into our institutional money market platform and have recaptured
share. We also won a number of key mandates across products, including outsourced investment solutions, Tax
Advantaged Equity, and quant active. Our new product launches in the quarter focused on alternatives.
Within Asset Servicing, we continue to have good momentum in core custody and fund administration, particularly
with asset managers in Europe, and our pipeline remains robust. In the UK, we were reappointed by Brightwell for
middle office services. Brightwell is the primary service provider to British Telecom Pension Scheme, which has
more than $50 billion in assets under management. Among asset owners, we clinched several key multimillion-
dollar takeaway wins in North America, where our front office solutions, which provides a comprehensive view
across public and private assets, was cited as a key differentiator.
As a testament to our capabilities, we are recently awarded three prestigious industry awards, including: Best
Global Custodian for Asset Owners by Asian Investor. In the second quarter, we launched A-Suite, our content
community and collaboration hub for global asset owners. Within the first few weeks of launch, we've seen
significant client engagement. Going forward, we expect this new communications channel to create relationships
with key target audiences and further showcase our expertise in the market.
In closing, our balance sheet continues to be very strong with ample capital and liquidity. Our new business
momentum is gathering steam and our pipeline remains robust. While there's still more work to be done, we're
making solid progress following the trajectory of our expense growth. Rationalizing our cost base remains a top
priority, and the governance and control mechanisms we're putting in place today should drive sustainable
improvements for both the near term and for years to come.
We head into the second half of the year well-positioned to support our clients and generate value for all of our
stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to Jason.

Thank you, Mike, and let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our second quarter 2023 earnings call.
Let's dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on page 4. This morning, we reported second quarter net
income of $332 million, earnings per share of $1.56, and our return on average common equity was 12.4%.
Currency movements had an immaterial impact on our revenue and expense growth in both periods.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Our second quarter results were impacted by two notable items. We recognized a $38.7 million pre-tax severance
charge impacting both our Compensation and Outside Services line items. We recorded a $25.6 million pre-tax
charge associated with the write-off of an investment in a client capability. Notable items from previous periods
are listed on the slide.
Excluding notable items in all periods, revenue is up 1% on a sequential quarter basis and down 1% over the prior
year. Expenses were down 1% on a sequential quarter basis and up 5% over the prior year. This reflects an
expense to trust fee ratio of 116%, down from 120% in the first quarter and 122% in the fourth quarter of last year.
Pre-tax income was up 13% sequentially but down 9% over the prior year.
Trust, investment, and other servicing fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1.1
billion, which reflected a 3% sequential increase, but a 4% decrease as compared to last year. All other
noninterest income was flat sequentially, but down 10% over the prior year.
Net interest income, on an FTE basis, which I'll discuss in more detail in a few moments, is $525 million, down 4%
sequentially but up 12% from a year ago. We had a $15 million credit reserve release in the second quarter due
to improved credit quality on a small number of larger loans, which is offset in part by expectations for higher
future economic stress in the commercial real estate market.
Turning to our Asset Servicing results on page 5, Assets Under Custody/Administration for Asset Servicing clients
were $13.5 trillion at quarter-end, up 2% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year. Asset servicing fees totaled
$621 million, which were up 3% sequentially, but down 3% year-over-year. Custody and fund administration fees,
the largest component of fees in the business were $427 million, up 3% sequentially, but down 1% year-over-
year.
Custody and fund administration fees increased on a linked-quarter basis for the second consecutive quarter due
to solid new business activity, higher transaction activity and favorable markets. They decreased from the prior
year quarter primarily due to unfavorable markets.
Assets under management, for Asset Servicing clients were $990 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 4% year-
over-year. Investment management fees within Asset Servicing was $134 million, up 6% sequentially, but down
10% year-over-year. Investment management fees increased sequentially, primarily due to asset inflows and
favorable markets. They decreased from the prior year quarter, primarily due to asset outflows and unfavorable
markets.
Moving to our Wealth Management business on page 6. Assets under management for our Wealth Management
clients were $376 billion at quarter end, up 2% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. Trust, investment and
other servicing fees were $475 million, up 3% sequentially but down 5% compared to the prior year.
Sequentially, the increase in fees in the regions was driven primarily by favorable markets. Sequentially, the
increase in GFO fees was driven by net inflows. Relative to the prior year, the decrease in fees in the regions was
primarily due to unfavorable markets and product-related asset outflows. Within GFO, the decrease in fees was
due largely to unfavorable markets.
Moving to page 7 and our balance sheet and NII trends. Our average balance sheet decreased 1% on a linked-
quarter basis, primarily due to lower client deposits; partially offset by higher leveraging activity. Earning assets

averaged $134 billion in the quarter; down 1% sequentially and down 4% versus the prior year. Money market
assets primarily absorbed the decrease.
Client liquidity continued to grow during the second quarter. While we saw a decline in average deposits, it was
more than offset by increases in other categories. Relative to the first quarter, our money market funds were up
$8 billion or 6%; and our CDs were up 29%. Average deposits were $106 billion, down $6.6 billion or 6%
sequentially, but remained consistent with late-April levels.
We experienced a $2.6 billion sequential decline in noninterest-bearing deposits, mostly within the institutional
channel, as clients continue to shift to higher yielding alternatives. This reduced the mix of noninterest bearing
deposits to 17%. At quarter end, operational deposits comprised approximately two-thirds of institutional deposits.
These tend to be the stickiest deposits as clients use them to operate their businesses. Approximately, three-
quarters of our average deposits are institutional, with the remainder related to wealth clients, including GFO.
Chipping to the asset side of the balance sheet, average securities were down 2% sequentially, reflecting the
natural run-off which we've seen to reinvest at the short end of the curve. Our $50 billion investment portfolio
consists largely of highly liquid US Treasury, agency and sovereign wealth fund bonds and is split approximately
evenly between available for sale and held to maturity. The duration of securities portfolio continued to edge down
in the second quarter to 2.1 years. The total balance sheet duration is now less than a year. Loan balances
averaged $42 billion and were up 1% sequentially.
Our loan portfolio is well-diversified across geographies, operating segments and loan types. Approximately 75%
of the portfolio is floating and the overall duration is less than one year. Our liquidity remains strong, with cash
held at the Fed and other central banks up 9% to $43 billion. More than 45% of our overall balance sheet is
comprised of cash, money market assets and available for sale securities. This translates to $73 billion of
immediately available liquidity, or more than 60% of the total deposit base.
Net interest income on an FTE basis was $525 million for the quarter, down 4% sequentially but up 12% from the
prior year. NII reflected the impact of several dynamics. We saw continued client migration out of deposits and
into higher yielding alternatives. Noninterest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits slid to 17% and
deposit costs increase with our interest bearing deposit beta during the quarter reaching 88% and our cumulative
beta for the cycle at 68%. The net interest margin on an FTE basis was 1.57% for the quarter, down 5 basis
points sequentially, but up 22 basis points from a year ago. The sequential decline reflects the impact of higher
funding costs, partially offset by higher short-term market rates.
Our NII in the third quarter will continue to be driven by client behavior, which has been less predictable given the
speed and velocity of this cycle's rate hikes. Our average client deposits thus far in the quarter are approximately
$106 billion. Deposit outflows are expected to continue in part due to seasonality as August is typically our low
point in the year, as European activity slows materially. The pace of the outflows is expected to moderate.
Turning to page 8, as reported, noninterest expenses were $1.3 billion in the second quarter, 4% higher
sequentially and 9% higher than the prior year. Excluding charges in both periods, as noted on the slide,
expenses in the second quarter were down 1% sequentially, but up 5% year-over-year. I'll hit on just a few
highlights. Compensation and technology expense continue to be the areas of highest spend. Compensation
expense, excluding severance charges, was down 5% sequentially but up 4% compared to the prior year. It was
down sequentially due to the payment of our annual retirement eligible incentives in the first quarter. This is
partially offset by the impact of this year's base pay adjustments, which are granted in the second quarter.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
The year-over-year growth in compensation expense largely reflects the impact from inflationary wage pressures
and last year's employee expansion, partially offset by lower incentives. Excluding charges, non-compensation
expense was up 3% sequentially. Primary driver of the increase was growth in the Outside Services line, which is
up 9% sequentially. The increase is largely due to timing. As we reported a sequential decline in Outside Services
of 9% in the first quarter due to delays in technical services projects. With our heightened focus on expense
control, we expect our operating expenses to grow more modestly and our expense to trust fee ratio to show
further improvement.
Turning to page 9, our capital ratios remain strong in the quarter and continue to be well above our required
regulatory minimums. Our common equity tier 1 ratio under standardized approach was flat to the prior quarter at
11.3%; despite continued common stock repurchases. This reflects a 430 basis point buffer above regulatory
requirements. Our tier 1 leverage ratio is 7.4%, up slightly from the prior quarter. We returned $257 million to
common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of $158 million and common stock repurchases of
$99 million.
And with that, Jenny, please open the line for questions.

Sharon Leung Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is actually Sharon Leung filling in for Steven. Just a question on deposit betas. They came
in a little bit better than expected this quarter. Can you help us understand how to think about the incremental
betas from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So betas have continued to increase. And from here, I think we still have to separate the institutional client
base from the wealth client base. We noted that we were cumulatively across the platform within this quarter in
the high-80% range. The institutional channel is likely going to be at 100% at this point. The wealth channel still
provides some benefit. The betas there are a lot lower, but at this point we're seeing about 100% in the
institutional channel and still much less than that in wealth and that seems to those – both of those trends seem to
be continuing as we've seen early signs in the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Leung Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Great. And then as a follow-up, you noted you're at about 17% noninterest bearing deposits today. I think you had
troughed closer to about 15% in the [ph] 2004 to 2006 (00:18:50) cycle. Can you help us think through where that
potentially goes from here and once that starts to normalize where you see NII exiting the year?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Sharon, well, like you, we've looked back a lot at where it's troughed. And the data we have showed, at a little
higher than the 15% you mentioned, I think it's 16%, but I don't think about that as a floor. There's nothing
structural in the base to consider that a floor.
Now, that said, it has been moderating significantly. And we don't see – we haven't seen much movement at this
point. Obviously, there's a step down this quarter of another percentage point, but it seems to be leveling off at
this point.

Operator: Next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning, Alex.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Good morning. Hello, everybody. So a couple of questions around expense trends. I guess, one, a little bit more
near term, you guys announced some action obviously over the course of the quarter. There's a severance
charge, so maybe help us quantify what it means in terms of savings and your just updated views on the overall
sort of firm-wide expense growth for the year, I guess, excluding the charges occurred in the second quarter. I
think, last time you talked about bringing that down to below 7%, but maybe an update there would be helpful.
And then, bigger picture question, you guys are running at a kind of high 20-ish-percent pre-tax margin that used
to be north of 30%. So as you kind of think about the fee environment getting a little better with the market, but NII
has clearly peaked as we talked about before. Is there an opportunity to get back to that 30%-plus? And how do
you see sort of achieving that, if that's the goal, and what's the timeframe around that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So let me tackle the expense, the compensation related first. First, I'm sure people are curious, where is the
base from here? So let me just provide some background on kind of first quarter to second quarter, second
quarter to third quarter. I think from here, we'd say flat to down from second quarter, ex the severance charge in
the compensation line.
So, if I go back to last quarter, we explained that the significant movements for second quarter would be the $40
million seasonal decline in equity awards and then the $20 million increase in the base pay coming online. That
would have put comp at about $575 million for the quarter, and obviously ex the charge, we ended up about $8
million better than that, including currency. So, two factors led to that.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
First, we pulled a lot of levers in the quarter to flatten compensation, including accelerating and close to
completing the actions that we launched in fourth quarter of last year. So in January, we communicated that the
projected reduction by late 2023 would be about 300 roles and about $5 million to $7 million in quarterly comp
benefit, net of reinvestments. So we guide a portion of that work done in the first quarter, and we mostly finished it
in second quarter, and that was big part of the reason it put us ahead of schedule.
Second, as we saw the timing of that first program accelerating and coming to completion, we launched a new
effort during the second quarter specifically related to what you referenced, Alex, in the severance charge that we
announced this morning. We've already gotten some benefit of that within the quarter, and that's reflected in the
result.
So overall, this new program, to your question, should impact about an incremental 600 roles. Many of that will be
backfilled based on a lens of skills or geography but same goal. We should be able to get $5 million to $7 million a
quarter in run rate savings, and a portion of that got embedded in the second quarter.
So, we've got to remember that we did pull the lever hard this quarter. So there's some hiring that's in the queue,
but we also pushed a fair amount back. And so, that's why, with various puts and starts, it's good to think about a
flat to down from the comp levels you see in second quarter ex charges going into third quarter. So, that's a
hopefully helpful background there.
To get to your questions on, for the rest of the year, where do we see expenses? At a high level, we've taken
about 1 point out of the curve for the year based on the trajectory that we're on. To your point, if you take out the
notable items this year on – each quarter has been under 6 points, and we think we've taken that point out of the
curve at this point, and that should continue through the rest of the year.
To margins, you're right that we – and we'd been in the 30s and now in the 20s. Our target has us – one of our
key performance indicators is for us to be in the 30s, and no way have we lost sight on that. That is where we're
trying to get. That gets impacted largely by what's going to happen in our minds, we can control the expense side,
and obviously we're doing a lot of work there. And we're also getting good benefit because we saw good organic
growth in the quarter. And so both levers are working in the right way, but we have definitely not changed our
target of being in the 30s from a margin perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks. Super comprehensive. Just a quick follow-up around deposit, so good news, you guys were kind
of in line with what you updated us on around $105 million. It sounds like deposits are fairly stable. I think you said
$106 million right now with a kind of similar noninterest-bearing mix, as we saw over the course of the quarter.
Can you help just frame the seasonal deposit outflows in any other kind of client conversations you're hearing that
could give us a sense where deposits could ultimately trough in the cycle. Sounds like there's a little bit more to
go, but just curious to hear what the endpoint might be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. You heard right, it's held in quite well so far in July. And we didn't – June – you see the end of the quarter
and there's a spike there. But in general, June and July have been at about this level and have been holding in
well. Our client activity is good. We've taken action here to make sure we're talking to clients aggressively and
telling them we want to continue providing good liquidity services for them, whether it's lending or holding on to
9

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
their deposits, but we've got a – we talked last quarter about the fact that we think about liquidity broadly. It's
about client liquidity. And it was good to see money market funds up this quarter. That adds to margins really well,
too.
And even as we think about what clients are holding in brokerage and so all of the client liquidity seems to be
holding in well. On the seasonality dynamic, August is a low point, but it's not – it doesn't go down dramatically.
We've looked back several years. And so we're feeling that deposits at these levels seem to be holding in okay.
So I can even give a little bit of thought from our perspective at this point, based on our outlook. I think it's prudent
to think about another decline, even though the deposits are holding in pretty well, but we see the competition.
And so I think it's prudent to think about another NII decline of about 5% for the quarter. Again, June and July
volumes have held in at about $100 billion to $110 billion, but we just have to be conscious of the competitive
environment and what the summer tends to hold in terms of volume pressure.

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Good morning. Hope all is well. Maybe just to go back to expenses. Appreciate the color you
gave, Jason. Normally, you start to talk about the seasonal lift that you typically get in the second half in things
like equipments and software and Outside Services. So I wonder if you want to comment on any projection there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Well, it's good to call it out. I think, in equipment and software in particular, we were better than what we
thought we were going to be, but that was – really two factors led to that. One, we did have some delays in
projects coming from WIP into being depreciated. Those will come online. So that's more timing. And then,
secondly, we've been working very aggressively as far as the Productivity Office to just negotiate on and then try
and push inflation down. And we had some good results there, bringing costs down.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
And so, from here, we think third quarter up $5 million to $10 million in that line item. Fourth quarter, we can even
tell because some of it's baked; an additional $5 million to $10 million lift from that perspective and Outside
Services, no update to make there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then Mike, you started off the call talking about some of the new business wins in Asset
Servicing and Wealth Management. I guess, how should we think about that contributing to organic revenue
growth? Maybe just broadly, if we're in a say a flat, flattish market situation, would you expect this to have a
positive impact in the next couple of quarters and going 2024 on revenue?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, Brian. So, the answer is yes. And, to your point, we only consider it organic growth once it's transitioned
and in and yet we know the pipeline of business or mandates that we've won that have not transitioned in yet. And
in each of the businesses, it's a little bit different. There's more of a – I'll call it forward pipeline with Asset
Servicing, but the pipeline looks very good based on recent activity that I mentioned there.
Within Wealth Management, there's not as much of a forward pipeline, if you will, but similarly there – I would say
very steady, steady activity. And as much as anything with Wealth Management, keeping in mind that this, I'll say
company, but also that business has been built on doing what's right for the client.
And sometimes that results in different financial implications for the company, but over time it is best for the
company and the shareholders. And my point being, the discussion around deposits and money market funds
and, treasuries and managing things like that, they all have different implications for us, but the client activity has
been very good. And we're, I would say, optimistic about how some of the shifts with rates will have implications
on where those funds get redeployed.
So again, positive on the Wealth Management front in a steady fashion. And then asset management, as Jason
mentioned, we've seen strong flows into the money market platform there, but that also in some other areas as
well; and likewise, I like to see those get redeployed in other ways over time. So, good across the board.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So it's fair to say that revenue growth on the fee side is definitely better than the NII side for the organic growth
equation at least now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. No, that's right, Brian. And I view it as you're kind of implying there. On the fee side, it tends to kind of grind
up more gradually, subject to the markets and NNI can be more volatile. And the only other area I would just
highlight is around our capital markets activity, FX and brokerage and trading there which has been relatively
subdued during this time period with lower volatilities, lower activity, which that can also change and that has
different implications too, just meaning those can be more profitable.

Robert Rutschow Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first question is on fee growth kind of more
broadly. You've sort of indicated that you're at the 5% expense growth rate. Does that go down? But do the fees –
where do you see fees growing to get up to that expense level so that you can grow fees faster than expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, I mean in the short run, I think we're still – I don't think we're still absorbing an inflationary environment from
an expense perspective. And so we'd like to be able to do better even than what we're doing right now in the long
run from an expense growth perspective.
On the revenue side, as you know, the lift – the financial model enables us to have lift from two different areas.
One is the market lift and that's tended to provide low-single-digit growth rates, but it's a very strong component of
the financial model. And then, secondly, the organic growth and if we can have low-single-digit growth in Wealth
Management organically, then mid-single-digit growth in Asset Servicing, that provides a good model for us to get
well above the expense rates that we think we can lead to in the long run and provide good operating leverage.

Robert Rutschow Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And if I could follow-up on wealth. You've improved growth there as well. Are there any differences in the
competitive dynamic among the top end, in the low end? Are you having more success? You said you're having
more success in the Global Family Office. I guess, can you talk about the funnel of new clients' sort of in the
middle tier and what you're doing to grow that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, it's interesting. It's actually not just the family office, but the very top end of wealth advisory. And those
clients can be similar size. They just happen to not have a family office and are leaning more toward us for wealth
advice as opposed to the broader set of more operational and reporting services that the Global Family Office
provides. We are doing better at the top end and looking at the new business that came on board, and at the
pipeline.
The accounts above $20 million, just that was where there was more velocity and that's been consistent for a
while on that business; and so there is something to that dynamic. We seem to be doing better at the top end.
That's where a disproportionate percentage of the growth has come from.

Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning, Brennan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good Morning. Hey, how you doing? Just a quick clarification point. Jason, you referenced a point of expense
benefit. Is it right to interpret that as coming off of your prior 7% or better expectation or was that meant in a
different way?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
It is correct to interpret that as saying we don't see 7% at this point. We said 7% or better; and at this point, we
should be doing 6% or better. We've done that first half and we see path to that the second half as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Perfect. Thank you for clarifying that. And then...

Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Sure. You guys had a write-off of a client capability. I don't remember seeing that in the past. Just a little
confusing to me. So maybe if you could help me understand it. When did you build that capability? And what
happened that caused you to write it off?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. I can give you some thoughts on it. It's just from a timing perspective. It's been in the works for many, many
quarters, but one of the pillars of the Productivity Office is to look at what we refer to as internal investments to
ensure that they're on track to meet our hurdle rates for returns and margins. The charge was a project to build
out a new client capability in Asset Servicing and specifically in the asset owners channel.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
So, after working and eventually discussing with different stakeholders, we didn't reach commercial agreement on
terms that would meet our hurdles, and so we halted the project. I think importantly, I presume you'd ask, are
there others like this in inventory? Absolutely not. We don't – this was a large project endeavor that we've been
working on and didn't reach resolution that got to our hurdle rates and so stopped the project.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Did something happen in the sort of like revenue opportunity that diminished it versus where you planned?
Because I'm sure you guys went through the process before you broke ground, so to speak, at least
metaphorically or was it that it was really pricey? It turned out to be more expensive to build. Was it the expense
side that that hurt the outlook versus plan or was it the revenue opportunity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. It was more costly to build than we thought, and the revenue dynamics were not, at that point, going to get
to our hurdle rate. And it really is reflective of us taking an extremely disciplined approach on items like this,
where we're not going to devote resources to areas where we're not going to achieve our hurdle rate.
And so, well before we talked about this, even internally, one of the pillars that we talked about for the Productivity
Office was looking at our internal investments, and this fits squarely in one of those areas. We define that as
areas where we're allocating resources, whether it's capital or expense dollars, and we're not at our hurdle rate.
And so, this is one where we were disciplined in saying, we're going to stop now, halt it, and not invest more into
this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Thanks for explaining that, Jason. It's actually a lot more encouraging than I interpreted it on paper. So,
thanks for the color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
No. Yeah. No, thanks for asking it. Probably if it's helpful to you to clarify, it's helpful to others. So thank you.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. If we can be in the 110% to 110% range, then that's – 105% to 110%, then we feel like we're in good shape
to do well, and we're grinding to get down there. We got down there before. We've been well above it. We got
down into that range, in fact even slightly below it for a quarter or two. And now, all the factors we've talked about,
higher inflation, markets coming down, and the fact of NII going up not helping that metric, we're outside that
range, but it is an important part of our financial model to be in that range.
And so, it's the first thing. It's first thing I look at is where are we? And it's good to see us getting back toward the
number that we – the range that we've articulated. It's another one of the key performance indicators that we talk
about internally.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Got it. Thanks. And just one follow-up on the positive organic growth commentary this morning. If you saw a big
acceleration in organic growth or a sustained period of strong organic growth multiple quarters, even several
years, how do you think that would impact expense growth, if at all?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, Rob, your two questions relate to each other, which is the primary way that we can drive that ratio to
the range that Jason talked about is through organic growth on the fee side, and then controlling organic
expenses, all right. And to your point, if you have higher organic growth, that is going to require more resources.
And to the extent that you don't achieve that, then you have to make sure that you're reducing the organic growth
on the expense side to get there.
But those are the two areas that we control the most. And then, you say, okay, but beyond that, as Jason
mentioned on the fee side, it's going to have the impact of markets and sometimes currency. And on the expense
side, you're going to have the impact from inflation, and to some extent, currency. And so, you try to focus on
what you can control the most, which are those two items, organic growth on fees and organic growth on
expenses, to ultimately drive it to the target range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. Thank you, both.

Connell J. Schmitz Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is actually Connell Schmitz filling in for Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Connell J. Schmitz Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Good. How are you? So just one question, a little bit nuanced on the credit portfolio, seems like a little bit of an
outlier. I know it's small, but on the reserve release, it seems like an outlier that there's an improved outlook on
your CRE book. Can you just explain what's going on there and where you see this line item from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So actually, just to clarify, there was the release. The release is a result of some improvement in a small
number of borrowers in that book. But that more than offset an actually worsening outlook that we have overall for
CRE. And so, it's not dramatic, but our outlook on that portion of the book actually would have caused an increase
in the reserve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Connell J. Schmitz Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. That makes more sense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Connell J. Schmitz Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I guess, one other question on the investment portfolio, you mentioned duration still sub-one year, and you're
mostly in cash. At what point – just given the context of potential future rate hikes, where do you see like this
duration heading in the coming months, and how are you planning to mix shift this book in that context to [ph]
detect (00:44:06) NII? Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah absolutely. So the duration of the securities book is at [ph] 2.1 (00:44:14). The duration of the balance sheet
is just under one year. And you're absolutely right to call out that it is an interesting time and what we think of as
the evolution of the yield curve. And so we've been allowing the maturity of securities to go, to become more liquid
as we reinvest them that's brought down duration.
At this point with the yield curve, we are talking about where to go from here. And that's not indicating it's going to
go up, but it's not on a – at this point we are thinking about where is the yield curve, where is it going and how
16


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
does that influence what we want to do as the large securities book continues to mature and provide opportunity
for reinvestment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Connell J. Schmitz Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then, I guess, one follow-up on that same topic. How should we think about earning asset growth in
the context of deposit outflows potentially? Should those flow out on a one-to-one basis or will you maintain
certain balance sheet size or...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. As the deposits come down, the securities can act as obviously a funding mechanism for it. That doesn't
move very quickly. And so the deposit size is always going to influence the earning asset size. And so what we
have to then think about the constraining factor at that point becomes what does leverage look like. And we've got
a lot of room from a leverage perspective.
And so that's what sometimes will lead us to think about discretionary leveraging just to make sure that we're not
missing opportunities to pick up some NII, even if it's at very thin NIM based on where the size of the balance
sheet is because it doesn't flex super quickly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Connell J. Schmitz Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. All right. That was it from me. Thanks a lot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A

Jason J. Tyler A

Good morning, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning. Maybe just actually following up on that question there. We noticed that the
complexion of your balance sheet has been shifting on the funding side naturally and that makes sense, but your
deposits they declined by 6%, but we saw that the higher cost Fed fund purchased balance actually jumped
meaningfully quarter-over-quarter has been growing this year. I guess why not just let the balance sheet decline
more? Like what's kind of going on there in terms of the mix? And how could that progress from here if the
deposits continue to trend down, as you talked about, will that balance – the Fed funds purchase balance
continue to grow as an offset to fund the assets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
17


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Yeah. And part of it is that in this – the deposits have just been so volatile and so you don't want to comment to
significant movement and shrinking the balance sheet and we want to be there for our clients. We've got plenty of
capital. We've got plenty of room for a leverage perspective. And so just not anxious to quickly do any significant
moves.
And so, to that extent, as deposits come down, you have the opportunity to then say, well, maybe we want to use
some discretionary leveraging again [indiscernible] (00:47:50) 7.4% Tier 1 leverage, which leaves you a lot of
room. And so if we hadn't done leveraging that incremental leveraging would be even higher in the 7s; and at a
point you just have to say it is prudent to make sure you're taking advantage of the opportunities that exist so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thanks for the color there. And then I guess maybe just following up on that point there on the
capital side. You guys increased the share buyback or you bought back about $100 million or so of stock this
quarter. Any expectation on how that could progress from here? What should we think about in terms of your
capital return?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. The overall theme of what you saw in this quarter makes sense in the near-term, or you see a speed in the
market for share repurchase. The thing that worked against us, the AOCI actually worked slightly against us this
quarter usually in a neutral rate environment, the pull the par will give us some lift there, but it did in this quarter,
that's fine. But even so, $100 million we did is about what – it's kind of that's the model we're thinking about in the
short run.
Big caveat is that the FDIC special assessment coming online, presumably in third quarter that would be a similar
dollar amount as what we did from a repurchase perspective this quarter. And so, you could see us saying hold
off for a quarter, get that payment done and then get back to your game plan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Very well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Jason, can you share with us – I think you gave us the cumulative beta through the cycle of 68% and then the
incremental beta, of course, is higher. I think you touched on it this quarter maybe 100%. The question is this how
is the beta behaving relative to past tightening cycles? I don't know if 2016 to 2018 is a cycle that really is that
comparable. Maybe I have to go back a little further. And then, second, how quickly – if the Fed does start cutting
Fed fund rates in 2024 sometime, how quickly can you guys reduce your deposit costs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. On the first, just to make sure I said it right earlier. The 100% going forward would be for the institutional
side of the business, not for the overall deposit base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Yeah. And to the question of how does how does that compare historically, this is higher than it has been
historically and just there's different dynamics that you and I could talk about, I think, that are driving that. But
there's a very strong competition for deposits right now and for various reasons. And so we want to make sure
that we're there for our clients.
And we still – we've got the ability to do that; and so we want to make sure that we're holding on to our fair share
and providing that liquidity capability for clients. If you think about reductions, the reductions can – they can come
quickly and the way we priced, the way our agreements work, we get fast movement on the way down and so we
should be able to get deposit costs down quickly as rates come down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow up, you also touched on the volatility of deposits. Is it more based on your guys'
experience at Northern? Are you finding that this period's volatility is even greater than past periods? And is it
because of quantitative tightening or Fed actions that is causing greater volatility in your guys' estimate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
It is more volatile; not just over the long run and we went from [ph] 90 to 138 down to 106 (00:52:24) but even
within the quarters, a lot of volatility, but I think that's driven by some of the macro factors. And what we saw in
early March spooked a lot of depositors obviously. And then another trend of debt ceiling and then leading to
another trend of deposit competition.
19


Northern Trust Corp.

All of those things are having or driving significant different preferences that clients have, not just between which
bank to go to, but whether to use banks versus money market funds versus treasuries. I think all of those factors
are reports leading to the heightened volatility we're seeing.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A

The Asset Servicing segment has actually overall been relatively stable. We'll see big chunky movements in and
out, but the overall level has been about the same. The Wealth segment is more granular. The GFO client base is
much chunkier, but you just think about the amount of clients in the Wealth segment, it just makes it more
granular.

Service has been great. And we didn't provide detail in the expense allocation between the business units, but
just in general you'll note that the head count is down but no impact to service levels whatsoever. This low-single-
digit growth I referenced was related to organic growth within Wealth Management.
