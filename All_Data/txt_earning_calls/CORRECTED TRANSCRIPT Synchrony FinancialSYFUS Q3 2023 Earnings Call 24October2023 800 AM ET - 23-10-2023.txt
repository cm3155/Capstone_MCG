Thanks, Kathryn. Good morning, everyone. Today, Synchrony reported strong third quarter results, including net

Our diversified product suite and advanced digital capabilities enabled Synchrony to continue to deliver
consistently strong results in an ever-changing environment. We are increasingly at the center of customers'
everyday financing needs and positioned as the partner of choice for retailers, merchants, and providers alike as
they seek enhanced value, greater utility and best-in-class experiences.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2023
We opened 5.7 million new accounts in the third quarter and grew average active accounts by 6%. We continue
to drive growth with our $47 billion of purchase volume, representing a record third quarter and a 5% increase
versus the prior year. This momentum is a testament to the power of our diversified portfolio.
Health & Wellness purchase volume grew 14% compared to last year, reflecting broad-based growth in active
accounts led by dental, pet and cosmetic. The 7% growth in digital purchase volume was driven by higher
average active accounts, as several of our newer programs continue to resonate with consumers.
In Diversified & Value, purchase volume grew 7%, reflecting growth in out-of-partner spend and strong retailer
performance. Lifestyle purchase volume increased 8%, reflecting growth in average transaction values and
outdoor luxury. And in Home & Auto, purchase volume remained flat versus last year, as growth in commercial
products, Home Specialty and the Auto Network was generally offset by lower retail traffic in Furniture and
Electronics and the impact of lower gas and lumber prices.
Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 42% of total purchase volume in the quarter and increased 13%, as
several of our newer value propositions continue to drive greater customer engagement. Synchrony's range of
products and platforms gives us a unique view into the health of the consumer. Through our monitoring, we see
continued trends of behavior normalizing to pre-pandemic levels.
Across the portfolio, average transaction values leveled off through the quarter after modestly declining in the
second quarter. Meanwhile, average transaction frequency, which had climbed throughout the year, showed
some signs of stabilization toward the end of the quarter. Looking at our out-of-partner spend, our customers are
becoming more selective in making larger purchases, including home furnishings and electronics and spending
less on travel.
Directionally, we see broad trends that are in line with our expectations across the portfolio with slowing spend
growth, normalization of payment rates, and growth in balances, which is driving higher net interest income. While
in the external deposit data we track, consumer savings balances remain approximately 8% above the average
level in 2020.
In summary, these trends show a consumer that continues to benefit from a strong labor market, while reverting
gradually toward historical spend and payment norms. As we closely monitor the health of the consumer, we also
continue to develop and deploy the compelling products and value propositions that attract consumers and
partners to Synchrony.
We announced earlier this month that both the PayPal and Venmo cards can now be provisioned in the [ph] app
or (00:05:36) wallet, representing our latest enhancement as we evolve to meet the demands of our increasingly
digital first customers.
Synchrony's journey began with in-store financing options, which have long been valued tools for both retailers
and consumers to build loyalty and drive value. Over time, we've broadened the utility of these products through
our dual and co-brand card strategies, which enable customers to make out-of-partner purchases, accumulate
rewards, and extract even greater value. And increasingly, our customers are taking that engagement even
further, as digital wallets enable everyday use functionality and extend our leading value propositions well beyond
the store.

Active wallet users are up over 45% year-to-date, and sales on wallets are up over 70%. This trend is more than a
simple technological enhancement. Synchrony's strategy to deliver enhanced utility and best-in-class experiences
requires seamlessly integrated, tailored solutions, and our investments in technology allow us to meet this
demand.
When our customers combine the broad utility of our products and services with our digital wallet functionality, the
impact is clear. Our digital wallet users spend nearly twice as much and have over double the transactions on
average.
More broadly, we see the impact of expanded product utility in our results. Out-of-partners spend continued its
outsized growth this quarter, up 12% compared to last year. We continue to develop our solution suite and extend
the reach of our products, meeting consumer demand for fast and secure shopping and opening new
opportunities for customers to engage with their favorite brands.
In Health & Wellness, we were pleased to announce partnerships with veterinary hospitals at three additional
universities. CareCredit is now accepted at 95% of the nation's public veterinary university hospitals, in addition to
more than 25,000 provider locations, expanding access to flexible financing tools that enable a lifetime of care for
all pets.
The power of Synchrony's continually evolving model, supported by our focus on technological innovation,
continues to position Synchrony as the partner of choice as we deliver digitally powered experiences and
compelling value for our many stakeholders.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.

Brian J. Wenzel Sr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's third quarter results reflected the strength of our
financial model, demonstrated through our consistent growth and strong risk-adjusted returns. The compelling
value propositions of our broad product suite continue to resonate with our 70-plus million customers and drove
broad-based growth across our sales platforms. Ending loan receivables grew 14% versus last year, benefiting
from the combination of approximately 120 basis point decrease in payment rate versus last year and 5% growth
in purchase volume.
Our third quarter payment rate was 16.3%, still remains approximately 130 basis points higher than our five-year
pre-pandemic historical average. Net interest income increased 11% to $4.4 billion, reflecting 21% growth in
interest and fees. The increase in interest and fees was due to the combined impact of higher loan receivables
and benchmark rates as well as lower payment rate.
Our net interest margin was 15.36%, declined 16 basis points compared to the prior year, as higher funding costs
more than offset the benefit of higher yields and favorable asset mix. Specifically, loan receivable yield grew 114
basis points and contributed 95 basis points to net interest margin. Higher liquidity portfolio yield contributed an
additional 46 basis points to net interest margin. And our mix of interest-earning assets improved net interest
margin by approximately 28 basis points, reflecting our strong growth in loan receivables. But these gains were
more than offset by higher interest-bearing liability costs, which increased 229 basis points to 4.34% and reduced
net interest margin by 185 basis points.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2023
RSAs of $979 million in the third quarter were 4.04% of average loan receivables, a $78 million decline from the
prior year, reflecting higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income. Our RSAs continue to
perform as designed. They provide a critical alignment with our partners as we navigate the evolving environment
together and support greater stability in our returns.
Provision for credit losses increased to $1.5 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $372 million reserve
build, which largely reflected the growth in loan receivables. Other expenses grew 8% to $1.2 billion, primarily
driven by the growth-related items as well as technology investments and operational losses. Our efficiency ratio
for the third quarter improved by approximately 330 basis points compared to last year to 33.2%.
Summarizing our financial results, Synchrony generated net earnings of $628 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, a
return on average assets of 2.3% and a return on tangible common equity of 22.9%.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 8. Our delinquency performance in the third quarter continued to
reflect normalization towards pre-pandemic behavior, with both the 30-plus and 90-plus delinquency rates
approaching 2019 levels. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.40% compared to 3.28% last year, and
approximately 7 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2019.
Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.06% versus 1.43% in the prior year, and approximately 1 basis point lower
than our third quarter of 2019. Our net charge-off rate was 4.60% versus 3% last year. Synchrony remains
approximately 115 basis points below the midpoint of our underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%, where our risk-
adjusted returns are more fully optimized.
Overall, our credit performance remains within our expectations and has benefited from investments in our
advanced underwriting platform, as we expect to continue on a path towards our long-term operating targets.
Focusing on our more recent vintages, they continue to perform in line with those from 2019. While we are
pleased with how these vintages are developing, we are continuously monitoring our portfolio and have
implemented further credit actions, including some tightening of our origination criteria. These proactive
refinements are intended to position our business for 2024 and beyond.
Moving to reserves. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.40%, up 6 basis
points from 10.34% in the second quarter. The reserve build of $372 million in the quarter was largely driven by
receivables growth.
Turning to slide 10. Our stable funding model and strong management of capital and liquidity continue to position
Synchrony well for any environment. In the third quarter, customers continued to be attracted to our consumer
bank offerings, as we grew both direct and brokered deposits to fund our anticipated receivables growth. Deposits
represented 84% of our total funding at quarter end.
The remainder of our funding stack is comprised of securitized and unsecured debt at 7% and 9% of our funding,
respectively. We completed a $1 billion securitized issuance in the quarter and will continue to be active in both
markets as conditions allow.
Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $20.5 billion, up $275 million from last year. At quarter end,
liquidity represented 18.2% of total assets, down 192 basis points from last year, as we manage our liquidity
portfolio and fund strong loan receivables growth.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2023
Moving on to our capital ratios. As a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued
by the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony made its annual transition adjustment of approximately 60 basis
points in January and will continue to make annual adjustments of approximately 60 basis points each year until
January of 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet.
Under the CECL transition rules, we entered the third quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.4%, 190 basis points lower
than last year's level of 14.3%.
The Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.2% under the CECL transition rules compared to 15.2% last year. The total capital
ratio decreased 120 basis points to 15.3%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis
decreased to 22.5% compared to 24.1% last year.
During the third quarter, we returned $254 million to our shareholders, consisting of $150 million of share
purchases and $104 million of common stock dividends. And at the end of the quarter, we had $850 million
remaining in our share with purchase authorization.
Synchrony remains well-positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance,
market conditions, regulatory restrictions, and subject to our capital plan. We will also continue to seek
opportunities to complete the development of our capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred
stock as conditions allow.
Now, please refer to slide 11 of the presentation for more detail on our outlook for 2023. We expect our ending
loan receivables to grow approximately 11% versus last year, reflecting the combined impact of payment rate
moderation and slowing purchase volume growth. We expect a full year net interest margin of approximately
15.15%. Net interest margin in the third quarter benefited from strong growth in interest and fees and receivables,
in addition to payment rate moderation and lower deposit betas.
In the fourth quarter, we expect net interest margin to be impacted by higher average liquidity to pre-fund
seasonal loan receivables growth, impacting the mix of interest earning assets, higher deposit betas driven by
competition and movement in benchmark rates, and interest and fee growth partially offset by rising reversals.
From a credit standpoint, delinquency nearly reached 2019 levels at quarter end and should follow seasonal
trends from this point. With the increased visibility into delinquency performance this year, we are tightening our
forecasted net charge-off rate to approximately 4.85%. We continue to anticipate our loss rate reaching a fully
normalized level between 5.5% and 6% on an annual basis in 2024.
And as we noted, we will continue to monitor and position the portfolio for 2024 and beyond.
We expect the RSA to trend at the low end of our prior outlook and be approximately 3.95% of average loan
receivables for the full year. This improved outlook reflects the impacts of the continued credit normalization,
lower net interest margin, and the mix of our loan receivables growth. And as we generate higher-than-anticipated
growth, we are maintaining our expectation for operating expenses at approximately $1.15 billion per quarter.
While we continue to make selective investments in our business, we are committed to delivering operating
leverage for the full year. As Synchrony continues to leverage our core strengths, our advanced data analytics,
our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management, and our stable funding model, we are confident
in our ability to execute on our key strategic priorities and deliver market-leading returns over the long term.
I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.

Good morning, Ryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Maybe a two-part question on credit. First, the full year guide implies a decent acceleration in charge [ph] off
(00:18:52) performance in the fourth quarter. So, you can maybe just talk a little bit about what's driving that. And
then second, maybe just tease out what gives you confidence that we're going to follow seasonal patterns from
here, given a handful of moving pieces, inflation, resumption of student loan payments, and then obviously we
have the growth [ph] math (00:19:10) impacts from 2022 and 2023. But offsetting that, you guys obviously were
one of the more conservative in underwriting, given some of the tightening that you had done. So, can you maybe
just walk through all of those moving pieces and what you think it means for the trajectory of credit losses? Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thank you. Sure. I'll try to get to all those [ph] many (00:19:27) questions, Ryan. So, the first one is you think
about the fourth quarter. I mean, you look at the dollar value, a little over $2 billion sitting in the 90-plus
delinquency bucket. So, I think if you go back and look at how it rolls, you get a pretty good sense of what we see
from the fourth quarter. I'd say the delinquency performance has been consistent really throughout 2023. And
really what you have here is a factor of our entry rate into delinquency is still below the pandemic period. So it's
back – it's lower than 2018, 2019, which makes collections a little bit tougher on the stuff that does roll in. So,
that's how I think about the fourth quarter.
When you start to think about 2024 and really how we get comfortable around credit performance – a handful of
things, I'd sit back and say, number one, we didn't [ph] accordion (00:20:18) the credit box, right? So, we don't
open and close it on our partners. So, our underwriting was consistent. And to some degree, in the early part of
the pandemic, we did not shrink as much, we did not expand as much when everyone was trying to make up for
the lost vintages. So, we kind of kept consistent throughout that period, number one.

Synchrony Financial
(SYF) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2023
Number two, our PRISM advanced underwriting tools allows us to be less score reliant and using the data from
our partners, we think, hopefully, we made very good choices or good choices during the pandemic period. When
I then look at some of the data, Ryan, I still look at the vintages that we put on in the pandemic period, they're
generally performing in line with the 2018, 2019 vintages. So, we're not seeing deterioration. Even when we look
externally, the TransUnion data, we see we're performing better than the vintages or other folks.
So, again, I think we feel comfortable with the tools we have in place. I think we're comfortable with performance.
That said, Ryan, we did take some actions here in the third quarter. And that was mainly around the fact that we
do have a shared consumer. So, other people who have maybe made certain underwriting choices can flow
through to us. And so, we want to make sure that our loss rate stays in our targeted range. And we really took
actions in order to ensure or try to ensure that we stay within our targeted underwriting loss rate of 5.5% to 6%
and optimize our risk adjustment margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Maybe as a follow-up, Brian. So, the RSA seems to be coming in better than had initially been forecasted
given the guidance for 3.95% for the year. And we look forward, losses are on a continued normalization and loan
growth seems to be slowing. So, can you maybe just tease out some of the moving pieces as we head into 2024?
It feels like we're kind of back in an environment similar to where we were in the 2018-2019 timeframe when credit
was normalizing and the RSA was coming in well below that 4% threshold. So, can you maybe talk through some
of those pieces? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks again, Ryan. As I think about the RSA, it's really performing as we designed it to be, right? So,
when losses were extremely low, it went over a 6% level. And now we're back into an environment today, it's sub-
4%. And again, it's driven by a couple of factors. One, the charge-off rate – charge-off dollars are clearly an
impact. Most certainly, the impact of cost of funds and interest-bearing liabilities is flowing through.
I think as you think forward the things that are going to make it move a little bit, it's going to be the mix of the
portfolio. Obviously, you look at something like Health & Wellness, we don't have as much RSA, that's going a
little bit faster. And then again, you're going to have – in some of the other portfolios that have a maybe higher
percentage of RSAs, depending upon their growth rates, will influence it. But again, it should track consistently.
I always point to, Ryan, we've talked about this before, if you looked at RSAs as a percent of purchase volume, it
is pretty stable through seasonal trends. So, again, we expect it to continue to operate the way it historically has.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Hi, Erika.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
My first question is on the direction of the net interest margin. So, it seems like we've fully solidified the notion of
higher for longer in 2024. How should we think about how your net interest margin should perform in a higher-for-
longer environment? And as we think about funding costs on the other side of the cycle, when we eventually get
to rate cuts, although the forward curve keeps pushing that out, how sensitive should we think about your funding
costs relative to cuts in fed funds?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, thanks, Erika. So, I think as we think about the margin as we move forward here, there's a little bit of
tailwind still to go on prime rate that flows through the books here in the fourth quarter. I think the second thing
you're going to continue to see is a benefit on the margin coming from higher revolve. We're still at payment rates
that are 130 basis points above the pandemic period. So, again, there should be some push-up there. There
should be a little bit of a headwind relative to reversals that go against that. So, that's really as I think about the
yield side of the equation.
On the interest-bearing liabilities side of the equation, again, there were a lot of assets that were put on – or
excuse me, a lot of deposits that were put on this year, they're going to have to reset next year. So, we'll see a
little bit of tick up next year in the interest-bearing liabilities as those shorter days CDs hopefully renew.
I think when you get to the backside of the cycle, that's really to be seen, right? There's a case that could be
made where betas will be a little bit slower, coming down for some of the folks that want to try to gather deposits
and get the yield side of their investment portfolios up. There are some that are going to want to try to push down
the cost of [ph] funding payments that are insensitive (00:25:42). So, I think as we get closer to that, we can
probably give you a better perspective of which way that will turn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my second question is on capital. There's been a lot of discussion for card companies in particular with
regards to how we should treat unfunded commitments and also the timing differences in terms of higher ACL
ratios in terms of the numerator deductions. So, could you give us a little bit of a preview, so to speak, on how the
pending new capital rules could impact Synchrony and how you're expecting that to impact your approach to
capital management?

(SYF) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2023
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Great question, Erika. So, when we look at the rules, the first thing I'd say, probably along with others,
we're clearly disappointed with the proposed rules around capital, both from the process in which the Fed went
through, as well as certain elements that we don't think were clearly thought through fully if you thought about a
holistic review of the capital stack, right? You combine that with what I would say is some apparent gold plating,
it's very difficult, I think, for the industry as a whole.
And I think you're seeing that in banks' feedback. I think you're seeing it through the trade groups' feedback. And I
think there is some even level of concern with the fed governors with regard to that. And then, finally, when you
think about Synchrony, before I get into the details, we're clearly disappointed that the tailoring rules effectively
have been eliminated by treating us on the same level as a lot of the other banking institutions.
With that said, Erika, if we looked at just taking those rules as they are, again, we're not sure that they would stay
as they are. The impact to us is probably between a 15% to 20% higher impact to capital. And the range there
depends really upon how you treat some of the RSA when you think about the operational risk pieces with the
RSA offset, the fraud and some of the revenue items. When I think about the unfunded commitments, that is a
fairly significant add-back to the RWA.
The good news for us, I think, we have a path where, through mitigation strategy, we think this would be very
manageable if it was enacted the way it was today. And part of it, when you think about the unfunded
commitments, a good bulk of that is is with accounts that are deemed inactive, so we can adjust line strategies
without impacting current customers in our business. So, I'm not sure, as we look at it and we talk about it as a
company, we believe there is a significant aspect with how we've managed the growth side of the business.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I guess my first question, Brian Wenzel, is for you, in terms of the reserve rate going
forward. We've seen some of the card issuers make adjustments to kind of what's inside the reserve and what's
not. And there are some risks associated with inflation and the fact that, just behaviorally, things are trending a
little bit different than they have in the past. Maybe you could just talk about the migration of reserve rate going
forward and you feel comfortable in the methodology at this point?

Yeah. Thanks for the question, Sanjay. Obviously, we feel comfortable at the end of the third quarter that we have
the right level of losses. As you think about it, the base assumptions that we have in the reserve model really
didn't change. I think when you look at the baselines that are out there, there's not a significant shift in the
underlying assumptions that are going into the model.
As we looked at the quarter, what you did see is a little bit of shift between the quantitative portion of the model
and the qualitative portion. But again, through the past history, we think, through the scenarios that we run, that
we've accounted for a potentially worsening macro. We hopefully have captured inflation as part of that model,
and then we also have student loans as part of it. So, we feel good about where we are as we sit today, and that
we can withstand changes in the macro environment.
That said when we look at it, there are 6 basis points of coverage between second quarter, third quarter given
these models that that isn't significant, and I wouldn't read into it that we have a deteriorating picture as we close
the quarter.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then maybe one for Brian Doubles. Brian, can you just talk about sort of the backdrop for
portfolio acquisitions, any renewals, that kind of stuff, and then maybe just the competitive environment in
general? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Sure, Sanjay. So, look, I would say, generally, it's a pretty constructive, competitive environment. I think
what we're seeing in the market around pricing new opportunities, renewals, is pretty disciplined, and I think any
time you enter into a period like we're in right now where there's some uncertainty on the horizon, you tend to see
issuers stay a little bit more conservative and a little more disciplined, which is good news for us.
In terms of renewals, we just announced Belk this quarter, it's a great renewal for us, kind of normal course, great
partner, very engaged customer base. And so, obviously we're always out there working the renewal pipeline on
our portfolio.
And then, in terms of new opportunities, I would say, on balance, it's probably more new program opportunities,
startup opportunities, less of the kind of big programs that are out there coming to market. And I think that'll hold
true probably for the next 12 to 18 months. And then beyond that, I think, you'll probably see some bigger
programs come up and be in the market.

Hey, John.

How are you?

Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
First, you guys have had pretty steady flow of new accounts the last few quarters. I'm wondering I mean, given
where you're underwriting and kind of what's going on in the world, kind of maybe what are the characteristics of
the new customers and any change from where you were a few years ago? And then what are the sources of the
new customers as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Look, John, I would say, consistent kind of trends on new accounts, both in terms of absolute magnitude as
well as where the accounts are coming from. One of the things that Brian mentioned, as we think about
underwriting, we don't expand the credit box in really good times, and we try not to really restrict it in more
uncertain times. And that means that we have more of a steady trend in terms of both new accounts, active
accounts, et cetera.
I would tell you that the new programs that we recently launched are performing really well. We're seeing really
good growth there, so we continue to be encouraged on that front. And you're seeing, I would say, really good
trends across all of the platforms. As we look at growth, it's not one platform that's really outperforming. You're
seeing that a little bit with Health & Wellness, but it's pretty broad-based, and that's encouraging.
I think the consumer has been much more resilient than any of us anticipated a year ago, and you're seeing that
across the board, whether you look at purchase volume, receivables, new accounts, active accounts. If we had to
pick a metric, that's one that's probably a little bit more important than new accounts because keeping that
consumer engaged, offering them more than one product, like that's a big part of our strategy. And so, we've been
pleased so far all year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. That's very helpful. And then the second question is I think I [ph] heard that you guys threw (00:33:44)
some disclosure that you guys were involved in at least evaluating GreenSky. I am wondering, kind of what's the
14

appetite for acquisition. I would assume the environment is a little bit better now with different opportunities, so
maybe if you could just take us through what you're looking at and where you might go from that perspective?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. I mean, look, we're always opportunistic when it comes to potential M&A opportunities. At the same time,
John, we're extremely disciplined around the financial return of those opportunities, making sure that they're
accretive. We weigh that against buying back our stock and other opportunities. And so, look, we're always in the
market. We've done some really nice smaller acquisitions over the last couple of years.
Pets Best has been an absolute home run for us. Since we acquired that business, I think the pets i2n force is up
5x just between 2019 when we acquired it and now. Allegro has been a great acquisition for us. Again, nice
acquisition, relatively small in terms of the capital outlay for that, but we've been able to leverage the scale of
Health & Wellness to grow that. We picked up some new products as part of that. So, those are the types of
acquisitions that we really like to do.
But with that said, we look at larger opportunities, but they've got to make sense. We balance those against other
uses for our capital, and they've got to have a nice return profile for us and a good path to EPS accretion.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. Thank you. Have you seen any particular shifts in payment rate trends for the near-prime to prime
consumer? If your – some of your competitors mentioned that there is a little bit more weakness primarily due to
household net worth or even savings rates within that cohort. Are you seeing any changes in payment rates
there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Good morning, Kevin. The first thing, when we think about the consumer, there's a lot of focus that goes
into savings rates anyway. And I'd say that the higher-end consumer cohorts do have excess savings that's in
there. But the prime – kind of right on the prime level to subprime, they've benefited by a 22.6% wage increase
since 2019, which has been able to really bolster them through this period.
When I look at payment rates and compare them year over year, right, where you see probably the biggest shift in
the payment rate is in that [ph] 6.60% to 7.20% (00:36:34) bucket. They're all moving from a little bit more full pay,
a statement pay down. But the biggest shift is in that [ph] 6.60% to 7.20% (00:36:44), which isn't necessarily that
15

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2023
concerning to us. It's still above where they were in the pre-pandemic period. So, I'd say a shift – it's not
something that we are concerned about or find it to be concerning at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then I know it's very early, but are you seeing any impact on payment rate trends for folks with federal
student loans? I know it's [ph] first (00:37:12) few weeks [ph] here, but just I wanted to (00:37:13)...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
It is early. Yeah. So, what's actually interesting, Kevin, when you look at that cohort, a couple of things. We've
done a lot of analysis on this group of people. [ph] We continue to do it (00:37:27). I think when you look at the
month of September, we saw a significant rise in people making payments in advance of the student loan
payments beginning in October, so that's a very good [ph] sign (00:37:38) for us with regard to that. We did a
deeper dive and we looked at how they are performing, those accounts, against – instead of the entire book really
against, I'd say, credit cohorts.
And to be honest with you, Kevin, you're going to find this interesting, they're actually performing better with
people with student loans versus people without student loans. So, [ph] they're clear (00:38:00) to be very, very
cautious. Again, the fact that a significant number of people did pick up payments prior to the due date. So, again,
what we expect going forward is that the fourth quarter is going to be a little bit noisy, so with regard to people
who may have forgotten that new servicers, et cetera, then you'll start to get a much better read as you move into
the first quarter.
What's going to be challenging for issuers is the fact that they're not – we don't expect them to be reported to the
bureaus until January 2025. So, there are things that we're going to watch with regard to changing those balances
and see whether or not we can detect, through the work of the bureaus, whether or not they are resuming
payments and how much they're paying down. So, we've kind of set that up in advance to monitor the population.
Again, we think we've provided for them in prior periods for ones that may struggle.

Good morning, Jeff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Just wanted to get an updated view on the late fees from the CFPB here. I know we're almost done with October
and haven't heard anything yet. Just wondering, has there been any shift in the dialogue out there, or are you still
fully expecting the rule to come out as proposed? And I guess, as a part of that question, when the rule comes
out, are you going to be taking any sort of proactive, preemptive actions in preparation, or are you more just going
to be in the wait-and-see approach and wait to see how it plays out in the courts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. No, thanks, Jeff. So, look, we're obviously still waiting for the final rule to be issued, so there's plenty of
unknowns out there until we see the final rule. We've got to see things like the implementation period, the final
amount. We also believe that it will be litigated, so we're going to watch that carefully, and that could impact the
timing as well. So, I guess, what I would say is, look, we're prepared for multiple scenarios in terms of timing.
We've been working very closely with our partners for over six months now. We're working on pricing offsets,
really with the goal of offsetting the impact here and putting us in a position with our partners where we can
underwrite a large cross-section of the customers that we do today.
We're obviously – it goes without saying, we're disappointed in the rule. Obviously, we think it has unintended
consequences that weren't properly evaluated. Late fees are a very important incentive to pay. $8 just clearly is
not an incentive. So without those offsets, it would restrict access to a pretty significant cross-section of
consumers. And no change to what we've said in the past. Our goal is to protect our partners, fully offset the
impact, and continue to underwrite and improve the majority of the customers that we do today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks. And just on the credit tightening side, I know you've discussed some more actions there,
positioning yourself for 2024, but at the same time, you weren't meeting it as hard as your peers. You were sort of
ahead of the curve there. Just wondering what would cause you to lean back in at this point? Is there any sort of
signals you're looking for out there or any sort of timing around that to be expecting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Just to be clear, to lean back into loosening credit or [indiscernible] (00:41:35)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, like when you might widen the credit box again?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, listen, we have a very good credit team that's consistently evaluating performance of the portfolio, by
partner, by vertical, by channel. And I think to some degree we want to see how credit develops across the
industry. Again, I talked about a shared consumer, so what other issuers are doing or not doing can't have a [ph]
17

full-throw (00:42:00) effect to us. So, again, we'll watch those things. There's not a telltale sign to say once this
happens, we will go. But our team has a lot of tools. We use a lot of data. We're using much more decision tree
and non-score-based measures in order to assess that. And, again, the data elements that we get from partners
will tell us how the consumer is performing.
So, we'll continue to look at that. And, again, Brian said it, I said it, we don't move the credit box around that often
because our partners want consistency in origination. Our customers want to have underwriting from us, and
that's part of our lower line low and grow strategy. Thanks, Jeff.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Regarding the back to the late fees, can you maybe just give us a little bit of color on how you think about the
timing of the offsets that you're negotiating at this time with your partners? You mentioned pricing and I'm
assuming there's other factors. Maybe if you could just talk about once the rule goes in place, what type of timing
should we expect in terms of being able to see some of the offsets of that initial impact?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So, look, I mean, obviously, there's still things related to timing that we don't know yet. And primarily that's
when the rule goes into effect, the impact of any litigation as well as the implementation period and the final rule.
The original rule as written was 60 days. That's just clearly not enough time to get this done. So, we think that
hopefully it will be longer than that. And those are the discussions that we're having with each of our partners. And
that will influence the nature of the pricing actions and the timing in which they go in.
So, I can't be really more specific than that, but we've got a really good plan in place, partner by partner. We've
been working on this for over six months. We feel good about the conversations that we've had and the actions
that we're going to take if the final rule goes into effect as written.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay, thank you. And then my second question is kind of a two-parter. First, on the incremental credit actions that
you implemented in the third quarter, can you maybe just elaborate there around what exactly you did in the third
18


Synchrony Financial

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2023
quarter versus what you've been doing previously. And then separately, you mentioned that the RSAs are not as
heavy in the Health & Wellness sector or business line. Can you talk about how much lower and then other
product areas that may also have a lower RSA? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So, with regard to the credit actions we took, a lot of it is around originations, but not around necessarily
score cutoffs as much as it is different data elements or different criterias that we factor differently in account
originations. We also are working on account management type actions, so triggers that come from the bureaus
of certain attributes or criterias where we would turn in a [ph] forum (00:45:12) or watch to a credit line decrease
or a closed account. So, those are the [ph] probably (00:45:18) two flavors of it. Again, it's not necessarily shifting
cutoff, it's really focusing on different criteria that are coming into our underwriting account management engine.
With regard to the second part of your question on the RSAs, we just highlighted Health & Wellness, and I think
we said it before, there's not a lot of RSA sitting in that particular sales platform. So, we just – it's that platform
grows at a faster rate, has a little bit of an influence on the overall RSA for the company. Outside of that, we're not
going to go into the different sales platforms from there, because the rest do have some level in each of the sales
platforms.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to start with just going back to the discussion around
credit. Your credit guidance for the full year implies, I think, a 4Q pretty close to the 5.5%, so getting back to your
long-term target, I was curious on how you see that evolving. I know you've talked about keeping underwriting
pretty steady, but you've also tightened. We've seen some pretty fast normalization here in the back half of this
year. Do you think it gets above your 5.5% to 6% target for a little bit in 2024 before coming back down kind of a
give back from the strong yields you had over the last couple of years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Well, good morning, Mihir. The first thing I'd say, and I don't think we've got enough credit for it as a
company, but we still haven't reached – and again, I know it's 7 basis points [ph] and while (00:46:56) we still not
have reached our pre-pandemic delinquency metrics, I think there's only a couple of issuers that are in that
category. So I wouldn't – I think we shouldn't undersell that, number one.
19

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2023
I think, number two, when you look at the performance, I'm not sure I would characterize it as accelerating in the
fourth quarter. If you go back and look at the growth on a dollar basis on 2017 and 2018 on average versus this,
they grew on average 18% to 19% in the 2017, 2018 period and we grew in this quarter 18% and 20% on a 30-
plus and 90-plus basis. So, probably in line, I'd say, with seasonality when you look at the relative percentages, if
you think about bps, they were [ph] 40 and 20, or 50 and 20, we're 56 and a little bit over 20 (00:47:44).
So, there's not a big deterioration, I'd sit here and say and characterize it that way. As we look at the performance
for net charge-offs next year as a full-year basis, one of the reasons why I think we've tightened a little bit here,
again, given the shared consumer is we're trying to maintain losses inside that 5.5% to 6%, and setting up the
portfolio well to perform there, because that's where we think the optimized risk-adjusted margin is for us as a
company.
I know others clearly are thinking now that they're willing to take a higher net charge-off rate at a lower margin.
That's not where we want to operate this company and deploy capital. It's not as effective for us. So, we're going
to be disciplined around that. So, again, when I look at that, and if you go back to earlier in the call, I talked about
some of the vintage performance and other things that we've seen that gives us some level of comfort that we
have a pretty good view of the trajectory.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Thank you. And then maybe just switching gears completely a little bit, wanted to ask about the BNPL offering at
Lowe's. BNPL obviously not as topical today as maybe 12 or 24 months ago, but I think you rolled it out this
quarter or very recently. It looks like you are the exclusive provider for the BNPL offering there, and it's a white
label, basically, also Synchrony Pay, which they're calling Lowe's Pay.
Now, I was wondering if you could just maybe expand on that a little bit, just talk about what do the economics
look like. Is it tied to your card offering in some way? Is this a competitive process? Is this an area you're looking
to expand and build out with other retailers? How are you thinking about that product? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Sure. So maybe to start more broadly, I think this has been an area where we've been investing with our
partners. I think the Pay Later products that we offer, it's a great way of really just to engage more customers and
offer them a new financing offer that's got really nice utility. We are seeing proof that the product does provide
both value to us and to our partners. If you look at the results this quarter, year over year, we've grown
installment, Pay Later products 29%. So, we're clearly over-indexing in that product. So, we feel pretty good. I
think the multi-product strategy that we've been talking about for well over a year now is starting to pay off, and
you're seeing that with what we announced and launched with Lowe's.
The Lowe's Pay is a white label version of that, and so one of the things that's really important to our strategy is
flexibility both in terms of how we offer the product inside of our partners, but flexibility to the consumer as well.
So, we're willing to offer that as Synchrony Pay Later, and we do that for a number of partners. We're also willing
to white label it, which I think is a real competitive advantage for us because a lot of partners or a lot of
competitors are not willing to do that. We're seeing really good traction on the launch so far, and we're just really
pleased to be able to offer another product inside of our Lowe's partnership.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Talk a little bit more about the health of the consumer in terms of the lower end versus the higher end. And
also do you feel more comfortable on one or the other, based on what you're seeing going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So, I think when you look at the consumer across three different metrics, the spending metrics, the
payment metrics, and then obviously the credit metrics. Let me start with credit first, that consumer is the one who
we're struggling to see a little bit more of those back to pre-pandemic levels in delinquency and their performance
in delinquency, and then deeper non-prime performing a little bit worse. So from a credit standpoint, they get in
delinquency. They don't really have the ability to cure out of it and are using other forms like settlements and debt-
settling companies in order to kind of solve some of it. And that to be expected in this environment, they just don't
have as much access to liquidity.
Again, what's keeping that consumer base going is a broad-based wage increase that has helped fuel that. So
even though they may have spent the dollars that they got during the pandemic stimulus packages, they do see
larger wage gains. So, again, what we're continuing to see is why the transaction values are a little bit lower for
them, the frequency is up, and they're continuing to spend it, we think, at a very manageable pace. Again, when
we look at our book, and look at the average balance in our book, if you look at 2019 versus now, it's up a CAGR
of 5%, and the open-to-buy is up a little bit more. So, I think the consumer is being relatively disciplined and there
is more liquidity in the system for them.
Clearly, when we look at high-end consumers, the high-end consumer is performing incredibly well. Their
payment rates remain above 2019 levels. They are showing strength. We've skewed in high end of prime up,
probably 3 percentage points in the super high end, which also has helped the portfolio performance. So, again,
we feel good. And when I look at the entire portfolio, entry into delinquency is still below 2019 levels.

Good morning, Rick.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Most have been asked and answered, but I just [ph] would (00:53:35) talk a little bit more about the RSA guide
and the improvement there. When we look at the charge-off rate, when we look at NIM, when we look at
everything, it looks like everything is kind of within the range, but of expectations both from an originals
perspective at the beginning of the year and from a second quarter perspective. But for whatever reason, you feel
like the RSA charge is going to be down a little bit. Is that really just a function of mix, or what else is contributing
to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, thanks for the question, Rick. It really is mix between the platforms and between the portfolios, and they're
– each of these arrangements are different. They're unique by partner. So, certain partners are performing better
than others. Certain ones have volume-based measures as well. So, it really depends on where that volume goes
and the performance of the individual portfolio. So, that is the main driver.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2023
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Yeah, most of my questions have been asked, but maybe if
you could just go back to your comments on reserves levels and reserve adequacy and where we go from here. I
get that, your reserves – you seem to be indicating that you feel comfortable with your reserve ratios, and you are,
I think, still about 40 to 50 basis points, if I'm not mistaken, above your day-one CECL allowance levels. But you
are expecting NCOs to normalize and move higher.
I would expect, your losses that will flow through your [ph] reasonable exportable (00:55:28) period will be moving
higher as we move forward. But maybe you can comment on your reserve outlook going forward and what would
induce you to maybe build reserves, what would need to happen for some additional reserve builds above and
beyond what you need for growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, thanks for the question. So, the way I would think about the reserve as we move forward is you should see
a rotation as you stabilize in delinquencies in this normalization period, that the quantitative model absorbs that
trend line. And then as we get more comfortable with the macro backdrops, the effects of inflation as student
loans – if they have an impact flow through the portfolio, you'll see the qualitative piece begin to come down and
effectively offset that. And then you'll move down, ultimately, we think, towards that day-one level, if the
assumptions come in generally as we think about it.
If you think about incremental provisioning on a rate basis here, again, most of the time we're talking about things
that are growth-driven in the portfolio, but truly rate-driven ones, a couple of factors that we look at is clearly if you
have a deterioration in collection performance, that could do it. Mainly that's associated a lot of times with
unemployment claims rising, so that could be a second factor that kind of goes in there. But collection
performance and unemployment claims are two of probably the bigger ones that we'd see.
Again, we haven't seen trends in collections that would warrant that today, so we feel good about that. And
unemployment claims have still remained historically low. So, again, we think we factored into our reserve at the
end of the third quarter qualitative assessments potentially deteriorating macro, and we'll just have to see how
that plays out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thank you. Have a good day.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And we are allotted time for questions today. So, we will take our final question from Arren
Cyganovich with Citi. Please go ahead.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2023
Thanks. I'll be quick. Your share buybacks came down just a touch. Can you talk about your outlook for buybacks
in the quarters ahead?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, first of all, good morning, Arren. Glad we were able to get your question in. With regard to the buybacks, we
generally do not give or we have not given quarterly guidance with regard to how the repurchase flow out for the
quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $850 million remaining under the current share repurchase
authorization as we move through the end of the capital year in June of next year.
What I probably want to be clear about with regard to that level for a second is what's not really driving the dollar
amount. So, I just really want to be clear that it's not related to a change in the macro environment for us, number
one. Two, it's not related to any potential proposals on late fees. And then three, it's not related to Basel III
endgame. We have a set of mile markers that we've set out in the capital plan that's more RWA-based than really
how our income kind of comes in versus plan. So, those are the factors. And again, we considered the other
factors, but that was not factored into our decision for the third quarter repurchases.
