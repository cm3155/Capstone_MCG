Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Thank you, Will. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for SouthState's third quarter results. For the
quarter, we generated broad-based growth in loans, deposits, revenue and earnings per share. Asset quality
metrics remain stable and expenses are in check. And with the backdrop of an improving yield curve, the setup is
looking pretty good for 2025. We've got a positive GDP forecast and low unemployment, so it feels like we're
transitioning to a period of expanding margins and accelerating growth. Two ingredients that are good for any
business.
It's also been a quarter that presented the challenge of the hurricane season. Our hearts go out to our teammates
and clients that endured the worst of the storms. For the most part, the severe damage you see on the news is
isolated to specific areas and not reflective of the broader geography. However, power outages, cell phone
disruption and gasoline shortages were widespread for a week or more.
Our business continuity team kept the bank running without disruption, so it really wasn't as much of an
operational challenge, since we've been through this before. But it was a chance to pull together as a community
bank and for neighbors to help neighbors and for our team members to help one another.
At SouthState, we have an employee-funded foundation called the Sunshine Fund, and that foundation provided
generators, groceries and needed supplies to fellow employees that were impacted by the storm. Several of you
reached out with notes of concern, and we appreciate that.
We continue to be excited about our partnership with Independent Financial. Everything appears to be on track.
We received shareholder approval in August and things are progressing as planned with the regulatory approval
process. Rather than waiting until closing, both the Independent and SouthState teams are traveling together now
throughout Texas, Colorado and throughout the Southeast. We're building new friendships long before we get to
the closing and a conversion next summer.
All in all, things are looking pretty good. Our strategy is to build our firm in the best markets, with the best scale
and the best business model and culture. Our colleagues from Independent share that vision, and together, we're
working towards that goal, which we believe will drive long term shareholder value.
Will, why don't you go ahead and walk us through the moving parts on the balance sheet and the income
statement.

William E. Matthews
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SouthState Corp.
Thank you, John. High level, the third quarter core profitability was consistent with the second quarter, with total
revenue up $1 million and non-interest expenses up $1 million for another quarter of PPNR of $183 million. Net
interest income was up $1 million on an additional day count and non-interest income was flat. Our NIM of 3.40%
was down 4 basis points from Q2. Loan yields increased 4 basis points – or 5 basis points, excluding accretion,
with that difference due to the early payoff of an acquired loan with the premium.
Loans grew to 4% annualized in the quarter, consistent with our mid-single digit expectation for the year with
single family residential and C&I loans experiencing the highest growth. The single family growth was mostly a
result of construction loans moving into the residential portfolio upon completion. You may notice a sizable
increase in our yield on loans held for sale, that is due to our SBA securitization business, which obtained its

pooling license and is now up and running. Those loans are on our balance sheet while pools are being created
and they carry higher yields than the single family residential loans that have historically made up that line item.
Deposit costs increased 10 basis points to 1.90%. Total deposits grew 6% during the quarter, with customer
deposits up $470 million on an ending basis and up approximately $90 million on average. Customer deposit
growth was predominantly in money market accounts with DDAs flat. We also elected to issue some brokered
CDs to replace FHLB overnight advances. Both of these areas of deposit growth caused the overall cost of total
deposits to increase a few basis points above our mid-1.80s guidance. I'll note that we did lower our deposit costs
effective October 1, including on exception priced accounts in alignment with our previous execution plan. Steve
will give some color on our future margin guidance in the Q&A.
Non-interest income of $75 million was slightly above expectations, with correspondent up $5 million or $1 million,
excluding the expense on variation margin collateral. This was offset by a $3 million decline in mortgage and a $4
million decline in other non-interest income. NIE excluding non-recurring items of $244 million was up $1.2 million
from Q2. Higher salary expense due to July 1 merit increases was offset by lower incentives and commissions.
Looking ahead to Q4, we expect NIE to fall in the $245 million to $250 million range, depending upon some
variable expense items. One note I'll make about NIE, with the upcoming merger with Independent, several
positions that are open or that were budgeted to be filled this year, are being held open with plans for
Independent team members to fill those roles. As such, we're seeing some reduced NIE this year while we wait to
close the merger and welcome those Independent employees to the team.
Our provision for credit losses was $2 million for funded loans, offset by a release of $9 million for unfunded
commitments, for a total release of $7 million. Unfunded commitment level declines, continued strong asset
quality and economic data and forecasts drove this result. Net charge-offs remained low at $6 million or 7 basis
points annualized. Total reserve levels ended the quarter at 1.52%, down 5 basis points from Q2. NPAs declined
$8 million with substandard and special mention loans essentially flat. Past dues and payment performance
continue to be strong and line of credit utilization rates continue to remain flat except for the funding of
construction loans as projects move towards completion. Capital improved again with our TCE ratio growing to
8.9%, our CET1 to 12.5% and our TBV per share growing $3.36 to end at $51.26.
Operator, we'll now take questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We would begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first
question comes from the line of Catherine Mealor, KBW. Catherine, your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I thought we could just start on the margin. Steve, if you could provide us with your updated outlook on how you
see the margin moving towards the next quarter and then into next year just with the updated move-in rates?
You've talked about how you're better positioned for rate cuts. I think before you've said that every rate cuts about
3 to 5 basis points in NIM improvement. Just curious if that still stands and how you think about the NIM moving
forwards? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. Sure, Catherine. And I'll try to kind of right set the third quarter, where we were and then kind of go from
there on forward. So, if you look at page 27 on the review of quarter three results, total revenue was right in line
with our guidance. NIM was down 4 basis points this quarter from 3.44% to 3.40%. But mainly that was due to the
increase in deposit costs of about 10 basis points. And for NIM, we forecasted it to be flat in the last call and so –
and the deposit cost to be up 5 to 6 basis points. But on the other side, non-interest income, we had forecasted
non-interest income to average assets to be 0.55% to 0.65% and it ended up on the higher end at 0.65%. So a
little low on NIM and a little high on non-interest income.
So, what happened from the June 30 to September 30, the 10-year treasury fell about 60 basis points, which
caused us to have less cash collateral from our counterparties. And in order to compensate for this decrease in
cash, we raised more higher comp deposits and funds throughout the quarter. The effects of this were it moved
our non-interest income up $3.9 million versus the second quarter through the interest on centrally cleared margin
line. On page 29, it shows up as – under the correspondent bank. That's really an interest expense and moved
our interest expense and deposits up by the same amount.
So, in summary, without that movement between the line items, NIM would have been 3.44%, which would have
been flat, cost of deposits would have been [indiscernible] (00:20:35) and non-interest income to average assets
would have been about [indiscernible] (00:20:37). So total revenue didn't change, but it was in two different
buckets. So I thought I would just kind of start out and kind of right set where we are because of the movement in
the 10-year.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
But to your question, as we think about guidance for next year, we're really just reiterating what the last quarter's
guidance, for every rate cut we're looking to 3 to 5 basis points for each of rate cuts, which is what we've said
before and it's consistent with our modeling. The timing of such, we think that you get to 3 to 5 basis points within
the first three to six months. Roughly two-thirds of that will be within the first quarter. And then the rest of it will
happen as you reprice the CD book. But it'll happen within a pretty short period of time, but, yeah, the mid-quarter,
it's probably not going to be much in that quarter, but more in the next quarter. But I think that's the normal lag.
One of the things that we missed on last call was 3.75% to 3.85% exit NIM in the fourth quarter with – first quarter
of 2025, I'm sorry, with IBTX and we continue to see that. We also, looking at our balance sheet, the fourth
quarter would be about roughly $50 billion in loans, $55 billion in deposits, this is the end of 2025. And then the
other guidance that we give and maybe just a little bit of an update is pre-IBTX for non-interest income we think
will be around 65 basis points, little bit on the high end just because of the drop in rate. Post-IBTX, last quarter we
said, non-interest income to average assets would be in the 50 to 55 basis points. We think now that'll be on the
high end of that range just because of that movement.
So anyway, I guess the point of all that's just to reiterate is let me just kind of outline a couple factors that we're
thinking through as we model. Number one, it's – there's really four of them. One is the level of the 10-year
treasury. So if for some reason the 10-year treasury went lower than 4%, it would really have no effect on the
revenue, but it would have lower NIM, higher non-interest income. So really, that's not a real revenue item.
The second one is level the five-year treasury, that affects our loan and securities repricing. We have about
between now – this is just us on a standalone basis – between now, for the fourth quarter this year and all four
quarters of next year, we have about $1 billion a quarter in loans. So $5 billion in total by the end of next year of
loans and about $1 billion in total securities maturing by the end of 2025 and at today's rates, we pick up about
200 basis points over what the coupon is today. If the five-year treasury moves higher or lower, it would move that
spread there.
The third one is this Fed rate cut. Last quarter we talked about six rate cuts was factored in end of 2025. Now with
like seven or eight, the things that will affect would be floating rate loans and deposits, but I kind of look at the
level of those [indiscernible] (00:23:41) probably offset each other a little bit.
The last one is just our IBTX day one mark. So as we contemplate closing that in the first quarter, when we
announced the deal, the five-year treasury was around 4.5%, today it's about 4%, so 50 basis points lower. What
that leads to is less day one dilution, more capital and less EPS accretion, maybe NIM. However, as we think
about that extra capital, the question for us going forward, if we did close on today, is do we take that excess
capital and restructure our own bond book with that capital that we already have. Those are the things that we're
thinking about. But the bottom line is, there's some pluses and minuses on all of that. But our guidance, based on
what we model, is the same.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's really comprehensive and helpful. And just looking at next quarter is – do you believe that – or can
you talk a little about what you're seeing in deposit costs with the first 50 basis points cut? I mean, I know deposit
cost increased this quarter, but if we look kind of towards the back part of the quarter, are you seeing an inflection
to where we could actually see deposit cost decline next quarter or do you still think we're stable to up a little bit
for a time period?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. No, that's good question. And yes, just as Will mentioned in the call, I think they cut rates in the middle of
September, we did not cut our deposit rates until October 1, but we did cut them. And if you recall, we have about
$10 billion of exception priced deposits and about $4.5 billion of CDs. So as we thought about it, we're trying to
get about 80% of the rate cuts on the exception priced deposits and then of course about 75% on the CDs and of
course the CDs kind of roll out over the first six months. So, we did see that. We did execute it. So we would
expect that, that would happen in the fourth quarter. We also expect that over time that we'll get a 20% beta over
time in deposits, but we did execute October 1 and we looked and have no issue with that.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler. Stephen, your line is
now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah, thanks. You guys talked – I think Will you spoke briefly on growth in consumer resi and a lot of that being
from construction migrating over to permanent. But I think I heard you also say the yields were better than
traditional resi. Can you give us a feel for that and kind of how you think about balance sheeting consumer resi at
this point, given the rate environment just kind of strategically there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SouthState Corp.
Yeah, what I was talking about, Stephen, I think sorry for the lack of clarity and I apologize my voice, I'm battling a
cold, but the – also about the loans held for sale, we announced earlier this year a team in Houston that buys and
pools SBA loans and then sells them in securities. And so the loans held for sale bucket in Q3 included some
SBA loans. And of course, those loans are Prime-plus type and it's all the guaranteed portion. But that's a higher
yield than what you see in the loans held for sale traditionally, which is up – made up of single family residential.
So that was that comment there, really wasn't related to sort of the balance sheet portfolio of consumer real
estate, but the loans held for sale line item. If you look at the yield table, you'll see that, that yield went up pretty
markedly from Q2 to Q3 in that item.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. And Stephen, I'd just said there's a little bit of noise in that line, just because the average balances versus
ending, but the bottom line is they're a little bit higher yielding loans that are floating and then eventually that team
will turn them into securities and get fee income from them. So that's a group that we're really excited about and
just started this quarter and doing the production.

Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Got it. Thanks for the clarification there. Sorry, I misunderstood that. And then just maybe to follow up on
that, I guess residential real estate, the question there. I mean, would you – as you see spreads on that portfolio,
do you want that percentage of loans to kind of remain in this 26% or has that become a less viable or less
beneficial component of the balance sheet in this rate environment? Just kind of how do you think about that
percentage of loans and growing or shrinking it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
Sure. Stephen, this is Steve. What will naturally happen when we merge with Independent that percentage of
loans will decrease. I can't remember exactly how far, but I want to say it's 21% or 22%. And then I would think
that we would kind of hold it pretty constant from there, might grow 1% or 2%, but I would expect that as we
continue to grow and grow our C&I and other businesses, that the balance sheet will probably particularly be used
there and then fee income will be more on the residential side. I think this quarter our residential production was
about 60% secondary, 40% portfolio. Our goal would be over time to get that closer to 70/30 and to use the
balance sheet for both our private banking clients as well as some of our low to mod portfolio products.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, helpful. And then just last one for me. I know John, you kind of talked about the overall strategy of building
the best team in the best markets and obviously great trajectory there. With the IBTX deal pending, do you guys
think about slow down potential hiring in your existing markets, do you kind of hold back capital and resources to
think more about new hires in those new markets in 2025 or kind of how do you think about that build out moving
forward and where you want to allocate resources to talent?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. Stephen, as we join with Independent, one of the things the team out there is excited about is the treasury
management platform that we're going to bring to bear for them, that we've worked on for a number of years here
at SouthState. If you think about C&I and middle market banking, having that sophisticated treasury management
tool really is the foundation of that. So once we get that in place, we envision having our Texas team, Colorado
team continue to recruit, but maybe a little bit more in the C&I area and layer that on top of the great CRE work
that they do and we're just going to continue to be opportunistic just like we always are in our existing markets to
hire great teams and not feel constrained on the budget from that standpoint. We're going to remain opportunistic.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to touch on the reserve release this
quarter. You guys have been understandably cautious and have built the reserve pretty meaningfully over the
past couple years. And it seems like the environment is now improving. Obviously, there'll be some accounting
gymnastics with the acquisition. But could we expect to see either further releases as rates come down or just
very low levels of provisioning as we move forward? Just hopefully the environment remains steady to improved.
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. Michael, it's Will. And obviously, that's a difficult question as we've talked about before. But I think what I'd
say is that the loss drivers, the economic forecasts are correlated with losses historically in the various portfolios.
What they projected at the end of the third quarter running the model generated the result that we had, which was
that the reserve level needed to come down a little bit as it did. And as we talk about CECL, of course it is a
forward-looking model. So in theory and in practice, I guess you should see reserve build well in advance of
charge-offs and you could see reserve releases even if the bank were to see some charge-offs pick up. But I think
to answer your question, one word answer would be yes. I think you could see reserve releases from here, from
us and others. You could see reserve levels come down. But it all will be driven by, number one, the economics,
the loss drivers; and B, the – or number two, the characteristics of the portfolio, how it's performing, what banks
are seeing in their own portfolio. So it's hard to predict anything looking forward, but it's not unlikely that you could
see that going forward. I wouldn't necessarily build that in your model, but it well could come at that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yeah, totally understand. Just wanted to understand conceptually just because all the forward-looking indicators,
criticized classified being kind of flat Q-on-Q and again, rates coming down.
Just separately, just wanted to touch on kind of the growth outlook. I think what we've heard from a lot of banks
this quarter is some near term trepidation, but pipelines still remain strong and I think people are optimistic once
we get through the election and kind of figure out what the rules of the game are. You could potentially see some
acceleration next year. So just wanted to get a sense from you guys what you're seeing in your markets, which
are obviously very strong. And then just follow on that, I saw that IBTX is exiting the warehouse business. So,
that's one vertical that you're not going to have on a pro forma basis. Is there anything else that you're either
looking to bolster or maybe not shutter but just reduce in terms of a focus? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. Michael, it's John. In our markets, the pipelines are steady, dipped in 2023 after Silicon Valley, picked up in
the fall of last year and they've really been steady at about $4 billion for the last three or four quarters. And we
guided late last year that we thought this year would be kind of a mid-single digit growth year. And the primary
factor driving and controlling that is the shape of the yield curve. It's just not as attractive to step on the gas right
now in an inverted yield curve and it looks like that inversion lasts, if you believe the forecast, probably through
mid-next year. But as the yield curve shape begins to normalize and begins to steepen, we think there will be an
acceleration in growth. The components of growth, Michael, if you look at this year, have been more C&I oriented.
We've done about 13% C&I growth year-to-date, a 10% this past quarter, but CRE activity has slowed down
largely because we believe the funding of construction loans, largely multifamily, is beginning to wane and just
less appetite for CRE with the shape of the yield curve. So anyway, I think going into 2025, our guidance probably

remains in that mid-single digit range. And when that yield curve starts to take a more normal shape, it probably
picks up from there given the strength of our markets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. And I'll just follow-up, Michael, on your mortgage warehouse question from Independent. And you know, in
our merger model, the way we contemplated that originally is that that would – those balances would not be there
and that they would be in the cash balances. And that's part of our $50 billion at the end of next year guide at 5%,
so that was always contemplated because of our conversations with Independent and their thought of exiting that
business. So there is nothing new. We just didn't – weren't able to publicly say that at that time.

open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Good morning. This is [ph] Justin (00:36:14) on for Dave. I had a question on credit quality in the multifamily and
office portfolios. Curious if you have any line of sight into potential upgrades there. And given the recent increases
in criticized assets, is there – is that any – in any way related to rent abatements or lease-up issues? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah, we're – [ph] Justin (00:36:37), we're pretty pleased with the asset quality trends this quarter. Past dues are
still low, about 26 basis points, only 7 basis points of charge-offs. Independent actually had zero charge-offs
during the quarter. And NPAs trended down. So, specifically as it relates to office and to multifamily, what we're
hearing from our credit team and office is they feel like from the properties that we're invested in, that the work
from home trend has bottomed. You're seeing Amazon and other companies require employees back to the
office. Now, will there continue to be some issues over the next couple of years, sure. But I think as we show in
our deck, we're concentrated in more small offices, under 50,000 square feet, not the over 500,000 square feet
where the Kansas City Fed thinks there'll be most of the issues.
On multifamily, as we look at that portfolio, the substandard increase that we've seen is really more about rising
interest rates on floating rate loans. We continue to see absorption in those properties. It's happening a little bit
slower. I think when we went back and analyzed on the construction loans, multifamily, we've got 70% of them are
performing exactly as we planned as it relates to rental rates and vacancy. The other ones that are behind, they're
not behind by much. The rental rates are off by maybe about 5%. I feel pretty good that with the in-migration and
the lack of housing supply, that those properties are going to fill up, they'll just take about a year longer than
maybe we plan on that portion. So hopefully that gives you some color on what we're seeing in those properties.
But right now, in theory, they're performing great. I mean, our past due ratio of CRE is only 7 basis points.

Yeah. And I'll just add [ph] Justin (00:38:36), from the standpoint of timing of downgrades, upgrades, we – our
general posture is to be quick to downgrade and slower to upgrade. So if rates stay lower or move lower, it
doesn't mean that the next quarter we're going to start upgrading things right away. We generally like to see some
trending and some sustained improvement. So we think that's a good conservative philosophy to have.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
So, I know you talked through the rate movement in 3Q and 10-year kind of impacting the NII and cash balances.
I mean, if we're kind of mark-to-market here, would it kind of reverse 10-year up as much as it is this quarter or is
there a lag effect [indiscernible] (00:39:31) whole conversation might be futile if the 10-year goes back down, but
I'm just kind of curious on how fast that changes everything?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
Sure. It's – Ben, this is Steve. Really probably the best way to think about it is based on the average yield of the
10-year in any particular period of time. That's probably what drives it. But I think in the second quarter, the
average yield of the senior treasury, I think was around 4.45% or 4.50%. And the average of the third quarter was
about 4%. So I'd kind of use kind of – I think it was maybe 3.95%, 4%. So I would kind of use the average 10-year
treasury in a quarter as sort of a benchmark. And then – because I think the 10-year actually even went down to
maybe 3.60% or so. I mean, it's been kind of wild ride, 3.60% to 4% in a quarter. I look at the average and
assuming that most forecasts have the 10-year treasury somewhere in the 4% range, give or take, I would use
our run rate in the third – excuse me, in the third quarter as kind of that interest on variation margin, sort of use
that same number as expense there.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then I know you gave some updated thoughts on margin, especially next year.
I mean, was high level, obviously, but is that marking to market both sides of the transaction or is that just yours?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
You're speaking to the Independent transaction as well? Is that what you're speaking to?

[indiscernible] (00:41:06)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
It did – yes, it did include IBTX. I'm sorry. So the fourth quarter exit rate would include, first quarter closing plus
our 3 to 5 basis points for each cut plus IBTX. All of that included $50 billion in loans, $55 billion in deposits, fourth
quarter exit rate in that 3.75% to 3.85% range. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. All right. And then just kind of higher level here. When you think about – you talked to deposit pricing,
you trimmed it on the 1st of October here. Can you kind of give us sense of the response? Have people looked to
shop for higher rates potentially? I know you have a really well-diversified deposit cost and flow, which I think is
great, but the problem with being kind of the lowest deposit franchise is you're kind of more at risk when things
are still stay elevated. Just kind of curious on any kind of anecdotal response you might be seeing from clients?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
Sure. Yeah. So far, we're three weeks into it and really nothing notable. I will say that if you kind of think about, we
have [indiscernible] (00:42:15) in deposits. What I would describe to you was about $10 billion of it is exception
priced. So it's a really maybe not a quarter, maybe it's 30% or so. That's really the sensitive interest rate piece of
it. So the other [indiscernible] (00:42:31) is not all that sensitive – $28 billion is not all that sensitive, because they
weren't sensitive to begin with because they're checking account relationship account. So it's really the $10 billion
you're talking about. And in those cases, we exception price those closer to market. And so when the Fed moves,
it would make sense that those rates would come down. So it doesn't surprise me on that $10 billion. We haven't
had a ton of pushback. We'll continue to monitor, of course, but that's where the sensitivity is, not on the other
piece of the business and that's why the – our checking account franchise is so valuable with the granular retail,
small business and commercial account.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. And then with the $4 billion CD book, the – our CD rates are never top of the market. So someone is
shopping to get the best CD and the market's not going to come into SouthState because of those rates. And then
the brokered CD book, of course, is at the marginal market cost.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Gary, your line is now
open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Wanted to ask more NIM question. If you assume that 4%, 10-year and that the income statement geography of
the variation margin piece does not change this quarter, does the 50 basis point cut in the September as opposed
to 2025 kind of push out the ability to show NIM expansion all else equal?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
No – no, I would expect all of that sort of was third quarter event, as I was talking about kind of the third quarter
10-year treasury, so assuming fourth quarter 10-year treasury is roughly the same, our cost of deposits have now
been fully baked in the third quarter, we did on October 1 cut deposit rate. So I would expect you'd have NIM
expansion 4, 5 basis points, something like that in the fourth quarter, because it's all sort of right set at a 3.40%
and then you move up from there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Appreciate that. And I know you gave kind of the outlook loaded for IBTX on fees to average assets. Just
kind of thinking through the year on the expense side, when the dust settles towards the end of 2025, do you
have a kind of a bogey for expense to average assets kind of exiting 2025 into 2026?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
Gary, don't have that – I don't have it in that terms. I guess looking at the various components, we're still of course
doing our final planning for 2025 [indiscernible] (00:45:19) like everybody else, not ready to give real precise
guidance on 2025 but in general since our own legacy SouthState expense base, you should see sort of
inflationary type, let's call it 3% to 4% type NIE on our book and then we got the IBTX merger occurring. And with
their NIE base, we are still confident that we will achieve the cost saves we announced on that merger. And so if
you take those components that's kind of where how we see NIE shaping up for next year. There obviously would
be a lot of noise in quarterly close and then the quarter of the conversion which is scheduled for the Memorial Day

weekend so in the second quarter and then after that, the third quarter should be a pretty clean NIE quarter and
certainly the fourth quarter, even more so for next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. And I would just add, I think, as you think about the fourth quarter, most of those costs will probably be out
of the cost saves. And if you kind of take our run rate, their run rate, add it together, make the changes for the CDI
and get the cost saves, I think the – it's roughly around 2% of assets, kind of a $1.4 billion run rate, give or take on
a annualized run rate. So I think that's about where we think that'll be, but could be in that general range. 2% of
the assets, probably a good way to think about it.
