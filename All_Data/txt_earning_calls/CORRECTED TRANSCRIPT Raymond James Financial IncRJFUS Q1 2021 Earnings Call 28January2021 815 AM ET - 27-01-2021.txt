Paul Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good morning. And thank you for joining us today. It's hard to believe it's been almost a year since the COVID-19
pandemic started here in the US. And while there is now light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccine starting to
be distributed across the globe, we are still very much in a period of uncertainty and volatility. As painful as the
pandemic has been for everyone, I'm very proud of how Raymond James has performed. Who would have
predicted, when we lost 40% of our earnings to the rate cuts in March, that we would be talking about records
today? This is a testament not only to the resiliency of the US economy but also to Raymond James, our advisors
and their associates.
As you can see on slide 3, our unwavering focus on serving clients resulted in fantastic financial results during the
quarter, starting off fiscal 2021 with record quarterly revenues and earnings, driven by strength across our
businesses. In the fiscal first quarter, the firm reported record net revenues of $2.22 billion, which were up 11%
over the prior year's fiscal first quarter and 7% over the prior record set in the preceding quarter. Record net

income of $312 million or $2.23 per diluted share increased 16% over the prior record of net income set a year-
ago quarter, and 49% over the preceding quarter.
Excluding expenses of $2 million associated with the completed acquisitions of NWPS Holdings and the pending
acquisition of Financo, adjusted quarterly net income was $314 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share
was $2.24, both records. Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 17.2% and return on tangible common
equity was 19%, an impressive result especially in this near zero rate environment and given our very strong
capital position.
Record quarterly results were primarily attributable to higher asset management and related administrative fees,
record investment banking revenues, strong fixed income brokerage revenues, and disciplined expense
management, which were more than offset the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates on the net
interest income and RJBDP fees. The record results and broad based strengths in our businesses in this near
zero rate interest environment, which included record results for Capital Markets and Asset Management
segments during the quarter, reinforced the value of our diverse and complementary businesses, sometimes
something underappreciated in different market cycles.
Moving to slide 4, we ended the quarter with records for total client assets under administration of $1.02 trillion,
PCG assets in fee-based accounts of $533 billion and financial assets under management of $170 billion. Client
assets crossing the $1 trillion mark for the first time is a testament to the consistent growth that we've achieved by
focusing on retaining our existing advisors while also recruiting high quality financial advisors.
And when you step back, this is quite an achievement. In December of 2010 we had around $260 billion of client
assets. So we have experienced around a 15% compounded annual growth and essentially quadrupled client
assets over a 10-year period, and the vast majority of that was organic growth.
We ended the quarter with 8,233 financial advisors, a net increase of 173 over the prior year, but a slight net
decrease of 6 sequentially. A flat advisor count is not unusual for this quarter as we typically see an elevated
number of retirements at the year-end where assets are typically retained at Raymond James by their successor.
We are still optimistic about all of our recruiting pipelines across our affiliation options, but there are a few trends
we are seeing in the industry.
On the independent side of the business, we continue to experience strong recruiting activity and we're seeing
more interest from both external and internal advisors in the RIA custody affiliation option, particularly for much
larger teams who have the scale and appetite to assume the regulatory and supervision responsibilities and risks.
We have been beneficiaries of this trend in our rebranded RIA & Custody Services division or RCS. And we
believe we'll continue to benefit from the trend given major consolidation and disruption in the RIA custody
industry.
However, it's important to note that when an RIA affiliates with RCS, whether it be an internal transfer from our
other affiliation option or external editions, we do not count the advisors of the RIA firms in our advisor count, but
their assets are still included in client assets under administration.
On the employee side, there has been a modest slowdown in recruiting due to the challenges brought on by
COVID and also increased competition for experienced advisors for even our regional competitors have
significantly increased their recruiting packages. In response to what we have seen, we have also enhanced our
recruiting packages to be more competitive while also ensuring attractive returns to our shareholders.

Also impacting advisor count this year, we temporarily decreased the size of our new advisor training class this
year by about 35 trainees, allowing us to dedicate more time and attention to newer advisors as they seek to
overcome the challenges presented by this current virtual environment. While this will negatively impact the
growth in advisor count when compared to prior years when the training class was larger, it really shouldn't have a
significant impact on client assets. We believe our recruiting will continue to thrive as advisors are attracted to our
supportive culture and client-first values.
Looking at recruiting results over the prior four quarters, financial advisors with nearly $270 million of trailing 12
production and nearly $40 billion of assets at their prior firms affiliated with Raymond James domestically. As for
our net organic growth results in the Private Client Group, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of $42
billion over the four quarters ending in December 31, 2020, representing more than 5% of domestic PCG client
assets at the beginning of the period. And remember, this is net of client fees. We are very pleased with our
consistent organic growth especially given the disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic during the
year. And as you know, we did not benefit from the surge in self-directed online business during the year.
Moving to segment results on slide 5, the Private Client Group generated quarterly net revenues of $1.47 billion
and pre-tax income of $140 million. Quarterly net revenues grew 5% over the preceding quarter, predominantly
driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees reflecting higher assets in fee-based
accounts which will continue to be a tailwind in the second quarter. This strong revenue growth helped the PCG's
pre-tax income grow 12% sequentially, although it's still down 8% on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to the
negative impact of lower short-term interest rates.
Capital Markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of $452 million and pre-tax income of $129
million, an extraordinary result, a strong quarter for the segment driven by broad based strength across global
equities and investment banking as well as fixed income. During the quarter, record investment banking revenues
were driven by record M&A revenues along with continued strength in debt and equity underwriting.
Fixed income brokerage revenues were strong as client activity levels remained robust. While we certainly would
caution you against annualizing the record results at Capital Markets segment this quarter, I do think the results
reflect the significant investments we have made to strengthen our platform over the last 10 years. And we are
continuing to make those investments as I will discuss shortly.
The Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $195 million and pre-tax income of $83
million. Record results were driven by the growth of financial assets under management as equity market
appreciation and the net inflows into PCG fee-based accounts more than offset the modest net outflows for
Carillon Tower Advisers.
Lastly, Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $167 million and pre-tax income of $71 million.
Compared to a year ago quarter, net revenues declined primarily due to the impact of lower short-term interest
rates on net interest income. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues grew 4% as higher asset balances more than
offset the 7 basis point decline in the bank's net interest margin in the quarter which was primarily attributable to
the growth in the agency MBS portfolio.
The credit quality of the bank's portfolio remains healthy, with most trends continuing to improve. Non-performing
assets remain low at 9 basis points of total assets and the amount of criticized loans declined 4% during the
quarter. The quarterly bank loan provision for credit losses of $14 million declined sequentially and was driven
mostly by macroeconomic model inputs now under the CECL methodology, which Paul Shoukry will cover in
more detail.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Moving to slide 6, as you've heard me say many times, we remain focused on long-term growth and are
committed to deploying excess capital to generate attractive returns to our shareholders. Good examples of that
commitment are the two acquisitions we announced during the quarter. The first, which closed in late December,
is NWPS. NWPS is a provider of a retirement plan administration, consulting, actuarial and administrative
services based in Seattle, Washington.
The addition of NWPS allows Raymond James to expand our retirement services offerings, including retirement
plan administration services to advisors and clients. Many of our advisors serve clients with small businesses and
offering this retirement solution is another attractive way to help advisors develop deeper and stronger
relationship with their clients.
The second pending acquisition, Financo, is a consumer-focused M&A advisory firm which allows us to
strategically grow our capabilities in an attractive vertical with industry leading team. We anticipate this transaction
to close in the March or April timeframe. Both of these firms represent great cultural and strategic fits and we're
excited about welcoming them to the Raymond James family.
While we are not going to discuss the terms of these two transactions, in total, over time, these two acquisitions
represent consideration, retention and earn-out potential for the sellers of approximately $320 million, so it's a
meaningful and attractive use of cash and capital. We will continue to actively pursue additional acquisitions that
are both cultural and strategic fits.
And now, for a more detailed review of the financial results, I'm going to turn this over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. I'll begin with consolidated revenues on slide 8. Record quarterly net revenues of $2.22 billion
grew 11% year over year and 7% sequentially. Asset management fees grew 12% on a year-over-year basis and
6% sequentially commensurate with the growth of fee-based assets. Private Client Group assets in fee-based
accounts were up 12% during the fiscal first quarter, which will provide a tailwind for this line item for the second
quarter of fiscal 2021. However, given fewer billable days in the March quarter, I would expect asset management
fees in PCG to increase about 10% sequentially.
Consolidated brokerage revenues of $528 million grew 15% over the prior year and represented a record. These
revenues are inherently difficult to predict, but our clients are still engaged in both the Private Client Group and
Capital Markets segments, given the current market and interest rate environment. Account service fees of $145
million declined 19% year-over-year, almost entirely due to the decrease in RJBDP fees from third-party banks
due to lower short-term interest rates, which I will discuss along with net interest income in more detail on the next
two slides. Consolidated investment banking revenues of $261 million grew 85% year-over-year and 18%
sequentially, achieving a record result driven by record M&A advisory revenues and strong debt and equity
underwriting.
Based on the pipeline and activity levels, we anticipate second quarter to be healthy but not as strong as the
remarkable result achieved in the first quarter. As you all know, these revenues are very difficult to predict. But for
the rest of the fiscal year, we would be very pleased to achieve the pace of the average quarterly investment
banking revenues from the annual record we set in fiscal 2020, which would be roughly $160 million to $165
million per quarter on average.

Turning to other revenues, which were $56 million for the quarter. This line included $24 million of private equity
valuation gains during the quarter, of what's approximately $10 million were attributable to non-controlling
interests reflected in other expenses.
Moving to slide 9, client domestics' cash sweep balances ended the quarter at a record $61.6 billion, increasing
11% sequentially and representing 6.7% of domestic PCG client assets. As we continue to experience growing
cash balances and less demand from third-party banks, more client cash is being held in the client interest
program at the broker-dealer. You can see those balances grew to $8.8 billion and most of that growth has been
used to purchase short-term treasuries to meet the associated reserve requirement. Over time, that cash could be
redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available which would hopefully earn a higher
spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries.
On slide 10, the top chart displays our firm-wide net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a
combined basis. Related, based on your feedback, we have updated our net interest table in the earnings release
to incorporate all of the firm's interest earning assets and liabilities instead of those balances for just Raymond
James Bank. We hope you find this update helpful, and as always, we thank you for your suggestions to continue
enhancing our disclosures.
As you can see on slide 10, while lower rates have put significant pressure on these revenues since the Fed rate
cuts in March 2020, we did experience a slight uptick in these revenues sequentially helped by the
aforementioned growth in client cash balances and higher asset balances at Raymond James Bank, which more
than offset the sequential NIM compression you see on the bottom left portion of the slide.
Given prepayment speeds of higher yielding securities and mortgages, we would expect the bank's NIM to decline
another 10 basis points or so throughout the year. However, we are hoping that growth in the bank's earning
assets will more than offset the NIM compression and result in continued growth of the firm's net interest income. I
will provide a bit more color on the bank's balance sheet growth in a few slides
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 11, first, compensation expense, which is by far our largest expense,
the compensation ratio decrease sequentially from 68.1% to 67.5% during the quarter, primarily due to record
revenues in the Capital Markets segment which had a 56% compensation ratio during the quarter, and the benefit
from the private equity valuation gain which doesn't have direct compensation associated with it.
As we said last quarter, given the near zero short-term interest rates and the successful implementation of the
expense initiative we announced last quarter, we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of 70% or
better, which we still believe is an appropriate target. And as we experienced this quarter, very strong capital
market results in any particular quarter could result in a compensation ratio below 70%.
Non-compensation expenses of $323 million increased $24 million or 8% compared to last year's first quarter, and
almost all of that increase could be explained by the $14 million bank loan provision for credit losses compared to
the $2 million benefit in the year ago period and $13 million of non-controlling interest in other expenses, much of
which offsets a portion of the $24 million private equity valuation gain reflected in other revenues. As we
explained, and as you can see in these results, we have been very focused on the disciplined management of all
compensation and non-compensation related expenses while still investing in growth and ensuring high service
levels for advisors and their clients.
Slide 12 shows our pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. Pre-tax margin was 18% in the fiscal first
quarter of 2021, which was boosted by the record Capital Markets results as that segment generated a record

29% pre-tax margin. Last quarter, we talked about generating a 14% to 15% pre-tax margin on a consolidated
basis in this near zero interest rate environment, which again we believe is still a reasonable target. But as we
experienced this quarter, there is upside to the margins when the Capital Markets results are so strong.
On slide 13, at the end of fiscal first quarter, total assets were approximately $53.7 billion, a 13% sequential
increase reflecting the dynamic I explained earlier with growth in client cash balances and associated reserves at
the broker-dealer. This growth of client cash balances on the balance sheet caused our Tier 1 leverage ratio to
decrease to 12.9% which is still well above the regulatory requirement. Liquidity remains very strong with $1.8
billion of cash at the parent, leaving us with plenty of flexibility to be both defensive and opportunistic.
Slide 14 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. In December, in addition to
increasing the quarterly dividend 5% to $0.39 per share, the Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of
up to $750 million, which replaced the previous authorization, and $740 million remains available under the new
authorization.
In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 108,000 shares for $10 million in average price of
approximately $92.80 per share. This fell short of our $50 million quarterly target, which we plan on making up for
in the subsequent quarters, as we are committed to repurchasing at least $200 million to offset share based
compensation dilution during the fiscal year.
One thing many of you have asked us to be more explicit on is our plans for deploying capital, which is something
we hope to discuss with you in much more detail at our Analyst Investor Day tentatively planned to be held
virtually in May. But at a high level, what I would share with you now is that our goal is to manage down the firm's
Tier 1 leverage ratio closer to 10% over time through a combination of balance sheet growth, primarily at the
bank, as well as more deliberate deployment of capital through a combination of organic growth, acquisitions and
share repurchases.
We are not ready to share a specific timeline to achieve this objective and doing so in the middle of a pandemic is
probably not the best time to do so. But I want to be clear that we are fully committed to managing our capital
levels, balancing our objectives of optimizing returns to shareholders while ensuring a significant balance sheet
flexibility and conservatism.
On the next two slides, we provide additional detail on the bank's loan portfolio, starting on slide 15 with some
detail on Raymond James Bank's asset composition. In the pie chart, you can see we broke out CRE and REIT
loans into separate categories with the implementation of CECL this quarter. The only other thing I would point
out on this slide is we have a very well diversified balance sheet at the bank. The bank's total assets grew 3%
sequentially, led by 4% growth in the bank's loan portfolio, about 60% of which was attributable to securities
based loans to Private Client Group clients.
We have decelerated the growth of the securities portfolio at the bank and will likely continue to do so over the
near term as spreads for agency mortgage backed securities have gotten extremely tight. Meanwhile, we have
resumed growth in certain sectors in the corporate loan portfolio that we believe are less directly exposed to the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Lastly, on slide 16, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. First, let me briefly discuss CECL.
We implemented CECL on October 1 which increased our allowances by approximately $45 million, with the
majority of that increase attributable to recruiting and retention related loans to financial advisors in the Private
Client Group segment, which now require a larger allowance under CECL than under the incurred loss method.

About $10 million of that day one impact was related to outstanding bank loans. And remember, all $45 million hit
the balance sheet directly and did not go to the P&L.
We had no charge-offs in the quarter. The quarterly bank loan provision for credit losses was $14 million, largely
attributable to the macroeconomic model inputs we used from a third party vendor, which assumed a greater
decline in commercial real estate prices in the near term with a longer recovery period, resulting in higher
allowances for the CRE portfolio from 3.25% to 4.2% at the end of the quarter. The bank loan allowance for credit
losses as a percent of total loans ended the quarter at 1.71%. So we believe we are adequately reserved, but that
could change rapidly if economic conditions deteriorate. But, currently, we are pleased with the credit quality and
the positive trends we are seeing with the loan portfolio and the broader economy.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thanks, Paul. As for our outlook, we remain well positioned entering the second fiscal quarter with the strong
capital ratios and record client assets. However, we'll continue to face headwinds from a full year of lower short-
term interest rates and there's still a high degree of uncertainty given the COVID-19 pandemic and the rollout of
the vaccine and a new administration.
In the Private Client Group segment, while recruiting environment is extremely competitive and we face some
challenges in a largely virtual environment, our advisor recruiting pipeline is strong across all of our affiliation
options, and the segment is going to benefit by starting the fiscal second quarter with strong sequential growth in
fee-based accounts. Private Client Group fee-based assets were up 12%, which should be a good tailwind and
result in a 10% increase in the associated revenues.
In the Capital Markets segment, there is still a significant amount of economic uncertainty due to the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic. However, the investment banking pipeline is currently strong and we expect fixed income
brokerage results to remain elevated given the current interest rate and economic conditions.
In the Asset Management segment, results will be positively impacted by the 11% increase in assets under
management, but those assets are built throughout the quarter. At Raymond James Bank, we should continue to
benefit from the attractive growth of securities-based loans and mortgages to PCG clients. And as we decelerate
the growth of securities portfolio, we are cautiously adding to corporate loans in the less COVID impacted sectors.
We continue to focus on long-term growth and our priorities remain unchanged. Our top priority is serving clients
and we're focused on organic growth, which is primarily driven by retaining and recruiting advisors in the Private
Client Group. Additionally, we're continuing to add senior talent in our other businesses such as investment
banking.
As you observed this quarter, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions, but we are still focused on being
deliberate and only pursuing transactions that have a great cultural and strategic fit and at prices that can deliver
attractive returns to our shareholders.
We started fiscal 2021 with very strong results and I believe we are well positioned to drive profitable growth in
the coming quarters across all of our businesses. But we are also fully aware that we are still in the middle of a
global health pandemic and we should all be prepared for much more economic turbulence and market volatility
over the next several months.

With that, operator, could you please open the line for questions?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question comes from Manan Gosalia of
Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, good morning. Maybe a question on the PCG segment. How should we think about the compensation ratio in
that segment? I know [ph] the risk (00:30:32) last quarter was about 100 basis points positive for the pre-tax
margin. But I guess when we look at the compensation in that segment it was pretty flat versus last quarter. So
were there any factors that are maybe masking that 100-basis point improvement here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean the biggest driver, Manan – and good morning to you as well. The biggest driver is really just the
growth in the production to advisors, that's going to have roughly a 75% payout associated with it. So that's going
to be your biggest driver of compensation in the PCG segment. As for the admin comp in the PCG segment, as
we said on the call last quarter, we expect that to be – we were expecting it to be relatively flat when we were on
the call last quarter, but the one driver there would be some of the benefits that grow with profitability across the
firm. But, again, we think that that's what we're really focusing on managing is the admin comp in the PCG
segment and that's what would be reflect – that would reflect the benefit from the expense initiatives we
announced last quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then on the capital return front, appreciate the update on how you're thinking about capital return and I
realize you can't give a timeline. But, in the past, you've mentioned 1.8 times book value threshold as a level that
you're looking at for doing more buybacks. Can you give us an update on how you're thinking about that now?
And would you maybe consider buying back at a higher level if the stock stays above that level in the absence of
any acquisition opportunities?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We're going to later roll out a more definitive capital plan, but are managing Tier 1 back to 10 percentage
over time. We've committed to the $200 million buybacks a year just to manage equity-based dilution at any price,
and then the other will be more opportunistic. So we'll just have to see that out now. The only caution on the
opportunistic part is we'd like to say we're feeling much better about the economy and the pandemic and the virus
being under control as people get the shots, but we don't know, right? So we'll be a little cautious on that part, but
we'll be a little more opportunistic outside of that $200 million kind of more programmatic buyback.

Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Just first question here just on the recruiting commentary and outlook, obviously you guys have been alluding to
some increased competition in recent months. So I just want to dig in a little bit because it seems like over time
recruiting competition kind of ebbs and flows and so I'm kind of curious what do you think is driving that right now.
And I guess I just want to make sure that I understand this whole message here. I guess my takeaway is that
independent advisor recruiting is still very strong and that's the expectation on the employee side, pricing has
become more competitive but it sounds like Raymond James will be or already is increasing kind of pricing
competitiveness. So should we expect that the recruiting on the employee side will remain active but just they
cost a bit more? Or I just want to make sure I'm taking the right takeaway here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
We've had a very robust recruiting history as you know, and certainly on the employee side as people
[indiscernible] (00:34:27) the transition assistance to be more – trying to grow their private client group business
as we did, and that gap just got bigger and bigger and bigger where I think that people even wanting to join just
said the economic gap was too big and – as we really analyzed it, that if we can get by upping – we don't have to
match, we've proven that over history but being more competitive because of the environment, what we offer
advisors, we can get a good return now and if interest rate spreads gap out again in the future, those recruiting
deals from our standpoint will even be better.
So we've gotten more aggressive, yeah. There's a little bit of lag but we think we can get it going. We did cut the
advisor class going in on a cost cut and then during the pandemic and as we ramp back up the training, which we
expect to once we get out of – as we kind of exiting the total virtual environment, that'll help also. So again, last
year, we had good recruiting stats to the quarter, but it isn't unusual to go back to the year before that it was
flattish. I think we're up to a record recruiting year.
So, we'll get it back on track and maybe we're a little slow to act but recruiting overall has been good. And then
we're going to have to figure out how to give you better numbers, because people are in the RIA channel, we
don't count them at all. And so you're not really seeing overall recruiting, although they are in the asset number.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay. That's really good color. Thank you, Paul. And then just a follow-up here on capital as well, appreciate the
update there. Is there any way you can just help refresh us how to think about the capacity of the bank growth or
the size of the bank within Raymond James? I appreciate that you're going to be opportunistic and can't really
give a timeline of expanding the bank balance sheet. But how should we think about based on whether it's third-
party bank deposits and client interest program, the capacity to fund growth or the size of the bank within the
overall firm, how are you guys thinking about maybe the upper band of capacity without giving us a timeline of
exactly how you'll get there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Hey, Devin. We would love to continue growing the bank and we have as you can see with the cash at third-party
banks and now in CIP at the broker-dealer. We have a lot of funding capacity and plenty of capital capacity to
grow the bank so that the biggest constraint now is just finding assets with good risk adjusted returns over a long
period of time
The way we're thinking about balance sheet growth overall as a firm, which includes primarily most of the growth
in the balance sheet would come from the bank going forward is that Tier 1 leverage ratio that Paul mentioned
which we hope to target about around at 10%, take that ratio down to somewhere around 10% over time. Now it
could go under 10%, if we're just accommodating client cash balances and investing it and parking it at the Fed or
investing it in treasuries, but on a more normalized basis I think 10% is a conservative place to be at as a holding
company overall. And so that's how we're thinking about the bank growth.
Some of the metrics in the past that we shared with you around percentage of equity and percentage of cash
balances, those were metrics that were established when we're primarily a corporate loan bank essentially. And
so we were – those metrics were intended to contain the size of the corporate – the credit exposure to our overall
balance sheet. Now that we have agency mortgage-backed securities and we have securities-based loans and
mortgages to Private Client Group clients, some of those metrics aren't as relevant as they were five years ago.
So that is going to be a part of the discussion that we hope to share more details with you on at our upcoming
Analyst Investor Day.

Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think it's certainly in sectors, as you know we were pretty aggressive on selling COVID exposed loans and so
that kind of shrunk the balance sheet a little bit, those sales, I mean at least relative to what it could grow. But we
track other kind of the non-COVID related areas and how the economy has performed even in near lockdowns in
places, we're pretty comfortable with a lot of others sectors. And so those are the sectors we're looking at
growing.
We've also looked at the spread on MBS securities and they're just not – there just isn't a lot. So we're looking at
higher grade corporate loans also to get a better spread with shorter duration which you buy at three-year, a
corporate loan in a well-run company in a non-COVID segment versus a treasury that is not yielding anything. So
we're looking, we're comfortable with the bank, the lending team, we have a lot of capacity, so we're – as we've
gone through this part of the pandemic even though there's uncertainty, we're getting more comfortable with
lending in areas that kind of open that back up.

Hey, guys. So I wanted to start off with a question on the Capital Markets outlook. You're coming off a record year
for fixed brokerage and what's informing your view that activity should remain elevated as it appears both you and
peers are over earning in that particular area relative to history?
And maybe just a question for Mr. Shoukry, since you alluded to the $160 million to $165 million run rate which
would be a good outcome for the quarterly run rate for IB, should we infer from your remarks there that this base
level is consistent with your view of what normalized activity looks like, and what you believe is readily achievable
within the IB segment in particular?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I'll answer the second part of the question first. I wish it was that scientific with projecting the investment
banking revenues. I think it was more of just a hypothetical on a going forward basis, if we kind of average $165
million of investment banking revenues a quarter then that would sort of match the record we set last fiscal year.
So is there upside to that? As we saw this quarter, there is upside to that and we are growing the platform. Paul
mentioned the Financo acquisition which we hope will close and we're also hiring a lot of other senior MDs. So we
have a pretty powerful investment banking platform. I think you saw the potential of that this quarter. But we just
want to caution the Street against annualizing against it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think it's – Steve, it's one of the difficult things that you talk to us or you talk to peers in the industry, everyone
was surprised at how little fuss this quarter was. I mean, it's not that we didn't have a good backlog. So when you
come off a quarter like this of activity, you go, well what's the next quarter look like. The backlogs are very good,
the activity is very high, but you hate to keep predicting a repeat of this quarter when it's an all-time record and I
think industry wide it was very strong. So can it continue? Yes. But that would be a guess too. So we kind of give
you numbers we're comfortable with, it doesn't mean we can't beat them. It just means that it's very hard to predict
these revenues in this business. And we certainly at last quarter's call didn't predict this number for this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
No, I empathize, we're dealing with the same struggles.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. And we're – I think the one thing we're comfortable with, and it can change overnight, but I think it's
the fixed income market. Given the dynamics, it's been a pretty good run and the dynamics were pretty much in
place and that usually won't shut off unless there's a major event. But M&A is still strong so it's – what number, I
don't know. It's just hard for us to predict. So again, we don't try to give you the optimistic numbers, we try to be
just realistic and hope we do better. I certainly know the bankers are hoping to do better but it's a lot of business
to close.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. And then maybe a little smaller in absolute size, but the debt underwriting business I think was a record this
quarter as well. So they finished the calendar year, public finance business did, in the top 10 in the country and
the pipelines there look good as well. So we have a very strong public finance franchise which will also contribute
to the results.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
No, it's great. And for my follow up, I just want to ask a follow up relating to the organic growth outlook, the
discussion that took place earlier. Appreciate the nuanced commentary around the recruiting backdrop and some
of the color around the different channels and what you're seeing. You quoted an NNA figure which implied about
5% organic growth in the quarter, slightly below the 6% to 7% you've recorded over the last year. And as you look

ahead, just given the heightened competition within the employee channel, what pace of NNA growth do you –
are you comfortable underwriting or we should be contemplating at least in the near to intermediate term given
some of the competitive dynamics that you cited?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Hey, Steve, I'll let Paul talk about the competitive dynamics. But just as far as the NNA metric goes, we – that 5%
was for the year, actually the fourth quarter for almost all the firms in our industry, us included, was seasonally
high because of the dividend and interest reinvestment. So, yeah, quarter-to-quarter that number can change,
because as you know the baseline, the beginning of the period asset rolls forward a quarter as well. So we're still
pleased with the 5% organic growth. And remember, that is net of the commission and fees in the Private Client
Group the way we count for it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And I would say on the recruiting, look, we've been – I've been here now almost a decade and we've had quarters
where this has happened, where recruiting has trailed off in different channels and we've adjusted and we've
been right back as kind of a benchmark for recruiting across our channels. And I believe we'll continue that.
Advisers want to be here. We have great tools, great technology and a great culture that supports them. So we
just maybe got a little uncompetitive and thought during the pandemic it didn't make sense.
But as we really dug into the economics, we had a lot of room to go up. So we did go up modestly and I still think
will be very good returns and we just – it's a hard choice for advisors when they come down to two places when
someone's going to pay them 50% more. So we're just going to have to close that gap and still be a good
economic return for the firm. So there's always a lag between when you do this and when the count comes up
and – recruiting isn't bad in the employee channel at all, it's just down from kind of series of records and we just
need to get it back up where it can be, I mean where it should be, given what we think we offer in our platform. So
I'm still very optimistic about it as it's been robust in all the other channels and we've had channels go up and
down before for a quarter or two and we've always rebounded. We'll just focus on it, get it back to where we think
it should be.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. Hey, Paul, I was hoping you could dig into the RIA and
the custody platform a little bit more. I guess, one, can you give us a sense for the assets on that platform now
and how much that's been contributing to you guys' NNAs over the last year? And slightly bigger picture, what is
sort of the key competitive advantage that you think differentiates you guys versus peers in this part of the
market? And from an economics perspective, I guess how should we be thinking about the revenue yield or the
operating income yield on those assets, sort of aside from the cash related revenues? I mean, obviously, that's
one, but are there other fees and things like that, that we should contemplate as part of the business grows?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So there's – it's a complex and multiple asset – multiple faceted answer and we plan again on Investor Day
to try to give better metrics because we aren't disclosing all that at current. But you're – in general, in that custody
type of platform, the return on assets may be a little lower and the margins are higher but you're calculating it on a
different revenue stream, so it's a little bit complex there. And traditionally, in that business, a lot of it was trading
fees which have gone away and interest spreads which are hopefully temporary gone away. So the economics in
that business with interest spreads are a little more challenged, but I think they're fairly compelling when you get it
back.
Our platform, the competitive part of our platform, is that as an RIA custodian, not only do we have a firm with an
investment grade background which makes us a great competitor, but we also can offer kind of full systems
platforms and others that other firms use third-party platform. So our goal would be to allow our platforms to be
used for people who want the turnkey as well as integrating third-party platforms and also access to our other
services such as lending and other things that we do through our bank and access to the other help that we give
and through our support centers which I think are much more robust than most RIA platforms.
So I think it's a strong alternative. We've shown growth, we've been in a while, we just talked about it less, and
we've seen both with the market is trading fees have gone away as regulation and best interests for some of the
larger advisors that felt it was just easier to be under the kind of the SEC versus FINRA and some of all the rules
and they could take on the compliance and risk, have chosen to do that. And so I think it's a long-term trend. It's
been a long-term trend. It's just picking up for certain advisors. And I think we'll be competitive in that platform too.
We just – we got a lot of growth ahead of us to get us some scale there, but so far so good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. And then my follow-up is around expenses and, Paul, you gave kind of updated thoughts around the comp
rate and, again, hopefully it could be better than 70% with the robust capital markets backdrop. But can you talk a
little bit about the non-comp outlook maybe excluding provision expenses? You guys have been running at a little
bit over $300 million this quarter and last quarter on those – kind of combination of those lines, again, excluding
credit provisions. How do you guys envision that evolving through the rest of the fiscal year? And I guess, to what
extent sort of the higher recruiting TA packages will push that number higher? Just trying to get some sort of
framework to think about it for the rest of the year. Thanks.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Yeah, I don't think the higher TA packages would really move the needle throughout the year, and that shows up
in compensation when it starts amortizing, not the non-comp line item. So we're at around $323 million this
quarter, which is sort of what we were guiding around and that included some NCI expense as well. The only
thing that is harder to project is what business development expenses are going to do throughout the year.
They're down 50% year-over-year, almost $20 million for the quarter. So we'll see how business travel recovers
as we progress throughout the calendar year.
But, overall, we're really focused as you can tell on managing all of the non-comp line items. Some of them grow
naturally with business growth, sub-advisory fees grow with fee-based assets in PCG for example, and those
were up 12% sequentially. So you're going to see some natural growth. But the ones that are controllable are the
ones that we're really focused on managing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think, in the shorter term, they will be well-managed. The question becomes when the environment opens up for
conferences and others you're going to get some rise. But, short term, this quarter we certainly don't have any
conferences scheduled and I don't know when that opens up. Some people would say late summer. My guess is
it'll take a while before people are comfortable with traveling and gathering. So it might be next calendar year
before you really see anything there.
So they're still well managed. We're managing them very closely as part of it and plan to do that. But we will add
people with growth. I mean, you recruit an advisor; you've got to hire an assistant. You've got – you recruit
advisors, you've got rent. You've got – there's just things if you open a branch. But the kind of discretionary stuff,
we're holding pretty tightly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. And maybe one other comment that Paul just reminded me of is, this first calendar quarter has some
seasonal factors to it. It's a shorter number of days, so that impacts your interest billings. We already talked about
the impact to asset management billings. There's payroll tax reset in the first calendar quarter across the board,
usually of higher mailings which for us shows up in the communication information processing. So there's some
short-term seasonal things from quarter-to-quarter but kind of echoing Paul's comments on the management of
the ones we can control.

Great. Thanks, guys. Another one on the competitive environment for advisors. How does what you're seeing in
the marketplace today compare to history? Is this about as competitive as you've seen it or not necessarily, more
like middle of the road? I guess that's the first part of the question. And then second part of the question is, are
you a little surprised about how competitive it's getting given where interest rates are?

Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
So the first question is, it's always been competitive. It's always been very competitive. We've always had – well,
we always had outliers; one or two people offering larger pack – kind of outsized packages [ph] we viewed
(00:54:31) to economics. So it's gotten a little more broad-based as some of the regional firms have joined into
the fray. So it's a little more competitive in that area.
I do think when we really dug into the economics that even though it was like – packages, we thought with this
interest rate environment made no sense. If you structure them right we believe you can get a good return. And if
spreads do come back, there'll be very, very good investments in those recruiting packages. So we always kind of
modeled our returns to current environment or we are conservative only at high spreads, assuming they're going
back to normal or historical averages.
In our packages, we were assuming they just stayed more like where they are now, which I think was probably
over punitive. So we're a little behind, we had room to increase it, and we'll do fine in the competitives. It's always
been competitive. We've always recruited people that had better, higher offers at other firms and we've been very
successful.
So would we lose some people because of it? Yeah. We just felt that we got a little out of the market in the last
couple of quarters, so we'll correct it and there'll still be a good return for the firm. And the other channels have
been doing fine. We had it in one channel, but we had this happen in other channels and had to make
adjustments and rebounded. So this whole business is always competitive. We've never had an easy road, right,
so.

Christopher Harris Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Quick follow-up for Paul Shoukry, you highlighted a bit more downside to the NIM as we progress through the
fiscal year. I'm guessing that's all coming from the AFS portfolio. Once we get sort of towards the end of the fiscal
year, is it fair to say that that we're probably close to bottoming on the NIM based on where interest rates are
today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. And you're right, Chris, it is really mostly, almost all of it is the agency mortgage backed securities portfolio.
We had 2% paper paying off and as people are refinancing their mortgages you're seeing pre-payment speeds
accelerate. And right now, with the Fed buying I think $40 billion a month is what they committed – re-committed
to yesterday, the spreads now are really tight. I mean we're talking about 50 basis points or so for three years of
duration.

Can you see that? You're [ph] getting (00:57:08) really paid a lot to take that three years of duration. So – but you
just do the math on that. That's where – if rates don't change for the next year or two, that's where the yield on
that portfolio would bottom out, assuming things don't improve in terms of the yield for the securities portfolio,
which is why we decelerated the growth of that this quarter and plan on the near-term sort of running in place with
that portfolio until we see maybe some improvement in those spreads.

James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities
Hey. Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe we could dig into a little bit the M&A business, it's been, obviously it's been
an area of focus and investment and obviously big surprise strength this quarter. Can you give us some metrics
that we can kind of think about, number of MDs, the growth rate in MDs, how to think about what is driving the
growth and how we can at least model it a little bit better?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
We've historically tried all sorts of things. We hold in underwriting a number of MDs. I think there's a number of
factors that – Jim Bunn, our current head, has just done a fantastic job of recruiting and developing MDs that are
even existing ones are producing or doing deals at levels we never thought that they could do three years ago.
And we have teams in segments that are just key players and compete against anybody of any size in their
verticals. So we hope Financo, which was an industry leading in their consumer area, will do the same. And so
we're – he's been building out vertical by vertical and globally certain sectors. So it's not just MDs, it's really the
production of those MDs and the size of deals and everything that's driving that.
So every time we give a metric over time it hasn't really tracked. So we'd be open and maybe we ought to look at
what other disclosures are to see if there's any information that we could give you. But we can't find a metric
especially over quarters because it's a cyclical business to some extent, that would give you a good indication. So
we've tried it in the past. We'll think about it and try again because if we could find the metric we'd give it to you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities
Well, I would say MD head count growth does have a pretty high correlation with long-term growth in advisory
fees so that could be helpful. But I appreciate it. Maybe turning to the comp ratio. Now, Paul, when you talk about
70% or lower, is that sort of assuming that kind of average quarterly run rate in investment banking? How do we
think about that target for the year versus the 67.5% in the first quarter? Are you assuming that in your numbers
or you're just sort of assuming on a average basis that $160 million to $165 million?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Yeah. I think that's – the primary driver is just the capital markets revenue mix. If you think about it our asset
management fees growing 10% next quarter in the Private Client Group business, that will have somewhere
around a 75% payoff associated with it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
So even if the Capital Markets segment generated the same revenues next quarter as it did this quarter which
we're not expecting at this juncture, then our comp ratio would go up. So it's just based on the revenue growth in
the Private Client Group business. So it's based on revenue mix. And the biggest driver of the upside, or I guess
in this case the downside in terms of being below 70%, would be very, very strong Capital Markets revenues.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities
Okay. All right. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kyle Voigt, KBW. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi, good morning. Thank you. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I guess maybe a follow-up
for Paul. You just spoke about the agency, book and agency deals. I was just wondering if there's any color you
could provide on how much more pressure we should expect on the resi loan yields for the remainder of the year,
just given that it's been drifting lower as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
We've seen a lot of refi activity there, which frankly is good for our clients, they're taking advantage of the lower
rate environment. So I think you'd see a little bit more continued pressure there but certainly not to the same
extent as the agency mortgage-backed securities. And with this, the NIM compression in those two categories, as
Paul said earlier, we're also focused on opportunistically growing the corporate loan portfolio. So I think our focus
is growing net interest income through asset growth to offset the NIM compression going forward. That's kind of
the way we're thinking about the bank's balance sheet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. Thank you.

Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
The good news right now is that we're – with our capital position and our liquidity position here, we got a lot of
flexibility. So we're looking – we're a growth company, we're looking at – we certainly came through what we hope
is the worst of the pandemic in great shape and it's – we're feeling more comfortable looking forward. We plan to

grow in the bank almost all the segments. I mean, the SBL segment certainly is a great asset for clients and a
good asset for us. The mortgage market I think looks like it's kind of bottomed out, so hopefully that will continue
to grow and get good spreads, and we're feeling more comfortable with the corporate side again. So we're feeling
a lot better than we were this time last year, or I guess March of last year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We're feeling really good this time last year.

Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Bill Katz, Citigroup. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question this morning. So just going back to maybe M&A broadly, you
had mentioned that over time you'd sort of put out $300 million plus of earn-outs related to the two deals. I was
wondering if you could help us understand how to think through maybe some of the earnings accretion or an ROE
type of construct against that payout. That's the first question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So the first thing is, as you've been around us long enough to know is that we don't do things for short-term
accretion, right, we do – and we're not aggressive in even how we account for any of it. So we do these projects
really because of long-term growth and we think they'll come. And I remember even getting back into Morgan
Keegan and others that we've been similar. We've done things that we think are structured well. They're long-term
growth. All of these kind of acquisitions have some intangibles that go against P&L, some of – they all have
usually transitional comp. They have things that in the short-term don't have big impacts, but longer term they've
had great impacts and I think that's how you would look at those two deals right now. But we're very, very high on
both of them. But I wouldn't say they're, short-term, going to have any kind of major accretion impact.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just within that, second question, just in terms of M&A big picture, and I appreciate
the discussion on capital management and Q1 levels etcetera, how are you thinking about like priorities from
here? There's been some interesting M&A by some of your peers and sort of wondering how you're thinking about
what areas of focus from here, whether it be asset management or scaling further into private client business.
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think our priorities have changed. So we are looking at both – Private Client Group is our biggest
business, we've looked at acquisitions as we've said both in private client but there aren't a lot that really fit, so

organic recruiting has been the engine that's driven, and if you look back even to 2010, the engine that's driven
has been organic recruiting not some of the really good acquisitions we've done in that area.
We are in the M&A area. We continue to talk to folks. And without the cultural fit or some of the deal prices, we've
walked from some things. I mean these aren't the only two deals we've looked at. And the third area that I think
we're spending more focus on are things like our plan administrator, who is taking businesses we do today and
helping to monetize them and give great service to our clients and advisors. And we've done that in the insurance
area with [ph] People's Choice (01:06:12), we've done that now with NWPS and we plan to keep looking at areas
like that, that use technology and service and practices to both create a service and a value to clients and a value
to us.
So there's a lot of things. We looked at also in the technology area now today. But we're very deliberate, but we're
very, very active and so we plan to hopefully, we would like to do more than we've done, but they have to fit and
they have to work. So we're going to continue on the course we've been on and hopefully deploy some more
capital.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I don't think we have any more questions then.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, great. Well, I appreciate you all joining us on the call and certainly a strong quarter for us. And again, we're
very optimistic in terms of the fundamentals. I don't know what will happen with the market but hopefully this
pandemic gets behind us and we feel in good shape at Raymond James. So, and just remember that we've – I
will sure remind you that our area is the home of not just the Stanley Cup champions, the baseball runner up, so
almost World Series champions but hopefully the football champions too at Raymond James Stadium where
they're playing for the NFL championship. So thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and
ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you, and have a good day.
