David Michael Solomon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thanks, Heather, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. I'd like to start by saying that all of us at
Goldman Sachs hope that you, your friends and family remain healthy amid the continuing challenges with
COVID-19. Let me begin on page 1 of the presentation with a summary of our financial results. In the third
quarter, we produced net revenues of $10.8 billion, up 30% versus a year ago. The strength and breadth of our
client franchise continue to be evident this quarter as we delivered net earnings of $3.6 billion, record quarterly
earnings of $9.68 per share, and a return on equity of 17.5% and return on tangible equity of 18.6%. Our third
quarter results contributed to strong year-to-date revenues of $33 billion and then ROE of 8%. Litigation costs
burdened our year-to-date returns by over 500 basis points. Returns were also impacted by higher reserve builds
for credit losses in the first half.
The third quarter continued to demonstrate the strength of our diversified business. We benefited from an
improving market backdrop, high levels of client engagements, continued countercyclical performance in market-
making and positive momentum across our strategic initiatives.
We maintained our leading global position in M&A as announcements increased in the quarter from a relatively
dormant period earlier in the year. We maintained strong league table positions in underwriting including a
number one ranking in equity underwriting and a top three ranking in high yield with both markets very active
during the quarter. We again delivered robust performance in global markets in both FICC and Equities on solid
client activity across our global platform reinforced by recent market share gains across asset classes in the first
half of 2020.
In Asset Management, we recognized strong gains from our public and private equity positions. We also
generated strong investment performance and positive net interest income in our credit portfolio, and we
continued to have success with our West Street strategic solutions front, we're on track for $14 billion of total
commitments.
We are delivering our full spectrum of alternatives capabilities and have launched marketing on new funds in
private equity, growth equity and real estate. In Wealth Management, we continue to provide valuable advice to
our ultrahigh net worth PWM clients. We also made progress integrating our new personal financial management
business to provide our high net worth clients with a broader set of capabilities and we've been pleased to see
synergies between both groups which have resulted in 700 referrals this year representing over $2.5 billion of an
asset opportunity.
In Consumer, we continue to have success, expanding our platform to serve individuals digitally, both directly and
through partnerships. During the quarter, we launched markets insights integrating Clarity Money's capabilities
into the Marcus app to give consumers a more comprehensive view of their finances. And we continued to make
progress building, checking and investment capabilities which we'll launch next year.
On the partnership side, we launched seller financing with Walmart, expanded on our June platform launch with
Amazon. Additionally, our partnership with Apple continues to grow and we look forward to leveraging our credit
card platform for additional partnerships over time.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
Turning to the operating environment on page two, we continue to navigate an uncertain backdrop brought on by
COVID-19 which has an unclear trajectory. From a macroeconomic perspective, the markets continue to benefit
from the unprecedented monetary and fiscal support by central banks and governments globally. In the third
quarter, the Federal Reserve announced its new approach to average inflation targeting and forecasted that
short-term rates would remain locked near zero for the next several years. In that same vein in the UK, where the
economy is expected to contract by over 9% this year, the Bank of England opened the door to negative rates as
a potential policy tool.
Meanwhile, US labor markets continue to show headline improvement with the unemployment rate declining to
7.9% in September, down nearly 50% from peak levels in April reflecting approximately 13 million people out of
work. That said, according to the latest jobs report, those improvements were largely driven by reversals of
temporary layoff while permanent job losses have risen to nearly four million people, reflecting some of the
deeper challenges in our economy. Additionally, there continues to be enormous uncertainty globally in the
trajectory of the virus which may impact the pace of the economic recovery as we head into the fall and winter. In
particular, we see continued challenges in a number of impacted industries including restaurants, hospitality and
oil and gas.
Despite these uncertainties, since our July earnings call, our economists' expectations for 2020 US GDP
improved by 120 basis points to an expected contraction of 3.4%, while global growth estimates slipped 50 basis
points to an expected 3.9% contraction. Looking at the next year, estimates have strengthened with expected
growth of nearly 6% in the US and 7% globally.
In spite of the ongoing challenges, we are seeing higher global equity markets and tighter credit spreads perhaps
as a reflection of the speed of economic recovery. During the third quarter, the S&P 500 rallied by 8% touching
new highs in September, leaving the index up 4% for the year. This yearly gain however was concentrated in the
top 5 tech companies which rose 42% while the remaining 495 names in the index declined by 2%. Equity market
volatility also remains elevated with the average VIX this quarter more than 60% higher than the third quarter a
year ago, though well below levels seen in March and April.
On the credit front, US investment-grade spreads tightened by roughly 20 basis points and high-yield spreads
tightened by almost 90 basis points during this quarter. As we go forward, we remain vigilant about risks in the
markets and potential weakness in the broader economy. Given the uncertain macro environment, we are
focused on serving our clients to help them navigate this evolving backdrop.
Before turning to Stephen, I'd like to spend a moment on our approach to return to office. We've employed a
number of new protocols to operate as safely as possible around the world. We do this as public and private
healthcare organizations work tirelessly to develop therapies and vaccines which I fully believe in time will allow
all of us to return to a more normalized environment. We are focused on helping our people come back safely as
being together enables greater collaboration which is key to our culture. We continue to employ an adaptable
approach which considers individual circumstances and local health recommendations to give our people the
flexibility and the tools they need to return to the office safely.
We continue to make measured progress. In Hong Kong and Tokyo, we have around 60% of our people working
from the office. In most of Europe, we're at around 50%. And in the UK, we're at nearly 30%. In New York, we've
seen a gradual uptick since Labor Day with roughly 2,000 people working in office as of last week. And we
currently have 30% of our people rotating through New York office on a weekly basis.

That said, we will continue to be nimble and remain in close contact with the relevant authorities in cities where
we operate and are ready to shift gears if the evolving situation with COVID-19 warrants. Under all circumstances,
we continue to keep the health and safety of our people as a top priority.
In closing, I would like to thank the people of Goldman Sachs who've remain dedicated to serving our clients while
managing the firm's risk, liquidity and capital to ensure our ongoing financial strength and operational resiliency.
While 2020 has been a difficult year in many ways, I'm incredibly pleased with the state of our client franchise and
progress we've made in executing on our strategic priorities. And I look forward to providing a more
comprehensive update on our investor day goals at our fourth quarter earnings call in January.
With that, I'll turn it over to Stephen.

Stephen M. Scherr
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, David, and good morning. Let me begin with our summary results on page 3. During the third quarter,
the firm performed well across all four of our business segments. In Investment Banking, our corporate clients
remained very active in raising debt and equity capital. We also saw an increase in strategic dialogue following a
more dormant period for M&A activity earlier in the year.
In Global Markets, client engagement remained high as we gained share during the year and enabled clients to
manage risks across asset classes. In Asset Management, strong growth was driven by higher management and
other fees, as well as gains from our long-term equity and credit investments, following a more challenged first
half of the year. We also saw double-digit revenue growth in our Consumer & Wealth Management segment as
we expand our service offering to individuals across the wealth spectrum.
With those headlines, let me now turn to our specific business performance on page 4, beginning with Investment
Banking. Investment Banking produced third quarter net revenues of nearly $2 billion, up 7% versus a year ago.
Financial advisory revenues of $507 million declined 27% versus last year on fewer transaction closings in the
quarter, reflecting the lower level of client activity in the first half of the year. Nevertheless, year-to-date we
participated in over $630 billion of announced transactions and closed approximately 225 deals for $810 billion of
deal volume.
We maintained our number one position in both announced and completed M&A league tables by a meaningful
margin. Importantly, the pace of M&A announcements has picked up considerably in recent months. Our
announced deal volume in the third quarter was up more than fivefold versus the second quarter, and our
Investment Banking client dialogues remain active.
The bigger headline in Investment Banking again in the third quarter was equity underwriting where we
regenerated $856 million in revenues, more than double the levels seen a year ago, marking our second highest
quarter ever. We ranked number one globally in equity underwriting as our year-to-date volumes climbed $80
billion across 436 deals, including 77 initial public offerings. In global IPOs, we ranked number one and picked up
approximately 180 basis points of market share versus last year.
We also saw strong activity this quarter in follow-on's and new products, including our participation in 21 private
transactions, a high-profile direct listing and a number of SPAC IPOs, providing clients advice and access to
capital in various forms.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
In debt underwriting, net revenues were $571 million, up 9% from a year ago. Though volumes normalized from
the record pace seen in the second quarter, the high yield market, in particular, saw healthy levels of new issue
activity. Our activity also included a number of novel structured transactions, particularly among industries most
impacted by COVID-19, such as airlines, where we uniquely enabled clients to leverage a broader collateral base
to access capital. As a result, we've been able to support our clients and grow our market share, generating a
solid number four ranking in global debt underwriting year-to-date. This performance reflects our long-term
strategic focus on this business as well as the velocity of underwriting commitments on our balance sheet.
Looking forward, our Investment Banking backlog increased significantly versus the second quarter. Growth was
supported by a ramp in M&A activity as I noted earlier as well as replenishment from equity and debt underwriting
transactions. In particular, new M&A announcements are creating a pipeline for acquisition financing in the
coming quarters. We are optimistic on activity across a broad set of sectors including TMT, FIG, Consumer,
healthcare and industrials.
Revenues from corporate lending were $35 million, reflecting lower results in relationship lending which includes
the impact of tighter credit spreads on hedges. As I've noted before, for risk management purposes, we maintain
single name hedges on certain larger lending commitments. Given the significant credit spread tightening over the
last two quarters, we have now reversed the vast majority of the $375 million in hedge gains we saw in the first
quarter. Also, of note in relationship lending, we've seen material pay downs versus the first half. Total notional
drawn on revolvers is now down 60% from the peak and nearing normalized levels.
Moving to Global Markets on page 5 where our businesses continued their strong performance. Net revenues
were $4.6 billion in the third quarter, up 29% versus a year ago amid attractive bid offer spreads, a supportive
market-making backdrop and continued elevated client activity. We expanded our market share this year as our
focus and commitment to serve clients during this volatile period drove results across asset classes and
geographies. During the first half, McKinsey reported that Goldman Sachs Global Markets delivered the best
institutional client performance among our global peers. Our strength was aided by number one rankings in both
G10 rates and credit and the number one global ranking in equities, which included the number one position in
EMEA and ties for number one in Asia and Japan.
Turning to FICC on page 6. Third quarter net revenues were $2.5 billion, up 49% versus the third quarter of 2019.
Growth versus last year was driven by a 65% increase in intermediation, which more than offset a 9% decrease in
financing revenues. In FICC intermediation, we had solid client flows and grew revenues in four out of five
businesses versus last year, leveraging our balance sheet to intermediate risk in a disciplined way. In credit,
performance was supported by strong client activity in the US and tighter investment-grade and high-yield credit
spreads. We also saw sustained volumes across our automated bond pricing engine.
In rates, revenues rose amid stronger risk management while client activity was solid, particularly around global
central bank actions during the quarter. In commodities, strong performance was driven by our metals business
and oil products amid persistent global supply imbalances.
In mortgages, revenues rose amid higher levels of client activity in agency products, bolstered by solid risk
management and tighter spreads. In currencies, revenues were stable as we continued to serve our global client
franchise with contributions across both G10 and emerging markets. Lastly, in FICC financing, we saw lower
revenues in repo and structured finance.
Turning to Equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $2.1 billion, up 10% versus a year ago. Equities
intermediation net revenues of $1.5 billion rose 36%, aided by higher client volumes across derivatives and cash,

reflecting the scale and breadth of our client franchise. In derivatives, we saw solid activity in flow, structured and
corporate transactions across both the US and Europe. In cash, we helped clients execute across both high and
low-touch channels.
Equities financing revenues of $585 million declined 25% year-over-year due to higher net funding costs,
including the impact of lower yields on our liquidity pool. Importantly, average client balances rose to near-record
levels.
Across Global Markets, we continue to invest in technology platforms to enhance client experience, build on our
strength in risk management and drive resource efficiencies. Like digital trends across many industries, COVID-
19 has accelerated client adoption and onboarding across our automated platforms.
While it remains difficult to predict client activity, and we do not have insight into the forward opportunity, we take
confidence in the market share gains experienced by the business through a deepening set of client relationships,
which has been a priority for the Global Markets leadership team. This progress should support revenue
sustainability as we go forward.
We also believe the upcoming US election, the variability of economic growth outlook and the 2021 global LIBOR
transition may bolster client activity across markets. Additionally, to the extent that sustained low interest rates
have their intended effect of stimulating economic growth and recovery, client activity may be further invigorated.
Moving to Asset Management on page 7, in the third quarter, we generated segment revenues of $2.8 billion, up
over 70% versus a year ago. Our third quarter revenues were driven by the continued market rebound, event-
driven activity and positive corporate performance of our portfolio companies.
Management and other fees totaled $728 million, up 10% versus a year ago, driven by higher average assets
under supervision, partially offset by a lower fee rate due to mix shift, given growth in liquidity and fixed income
products.
Equity investments produced $1.4 billion of net gains, aided by appreciation in our public investments and
valuation marks related to event-driven activity across our private equity portfolio. More specifically, on our $3
billion public equity portfolio, we generated nearly $800 million in gains from investments, including
BigCommerce, Avantor, Sprout and HeadHunter.
And on our $16 billion private equity portfolio, we generated gains of more than $400 million from various
positions, with the majority driven by events including corporate actions such as fundraisings, capital markets
activities and outright sales. Additionally, we had operating revenues of $230 million related to our portfolio of
consolidated investment entities.
Finally, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in Asset Management were $589 million on
revenues from NII and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. This reflected modestly tighter credit spreads
on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments, which continued to rebound from the broader market
sell-off in the first quarter.
Let me now turn to page 8, where we continue to provide transparency on the composition and diversification of
our Asset Management balance sheet. On the left side of this slide is our equity investment portfolio by sector,
geography and vintage. Our private portfolio remains highly diversified with over 800 positions where, excluding
Global Atlantic given its announced sale, none are larger than $425 million.

We also provide insight into our $21 billion portfolio of CIEs, primarily comprised of real estate investments, of
which $12 billion are financed predominantly by nonrecourse debt. The portfolio remains diversified by geography
and real estate sector. On the right side of the slide, we show our $31 billion in lending and debt investments in
the portfolio within the Asset Management segment, which includes $14 billion of debt investments and $17 billion
of loans that are largely secured.
I'll now turn to Consumer & Wealth Management on page 9. In this segment, we produced $1.5 billion of revenues
in the third quarter, up 13% versus a year ago, driven by higher Wealth Management AUS and higher consumer
banking revenues. Wealth Management and other fees of $957 million rose 9% versus last year, reflecting
increased client transaction activity and higher assets under supervision, which rose 8% to $575 billion, including
$24 billion of positive net inflows over the past 12 months.
Consumer banking revenues were a record $326 million in the third quarter, jumping 50% versus last year,
reflecting net interest income from credit card lending, strong year-over-year deposit growth and lower deposit
rates. Consumer deposits totaled $96 billion, reflecting $4 billion of growth in the quarter. The slower pace was
expected as we continued to limit UK new account growth in light of regulatory caps and reduced the rate on our
US market savings accounts given the lower interest rate environment.
While we exhibited improving beta in our deposit book, we saw very limited outflows of deposits, consistent with
our expectations despite two rate cuts during the quarter. Funded consumer loan balances remained stable at $7
billion, of which approximately $4 billion were from Marcus loans and $3 billion from Apple Card. We continue to
prudently risk-manage these portfolios and have moderated growth, relative to initial budget estimates. While we
remain attentive to the embedded risk, we continue to be pleased with the credit performance of these portfolios.
Next, let's turn to page 10 for our firmwide assets under supervision. Total AUS decreased slightly to $2 trillion
during the quarter, but are up approximately $275 billion versus a year ago. Our sequential decline was driven by
$90 billion of liquidity outflows following strong inflows in the first half; that offset by $51 billion of market
appreciation and $18 billion of long-term inflows.
On page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firmwide NII was
$1.1 billion for the third quarter, up versus a year ago, primarily reflecting growth in the firm's balance sheet,
particularly in Global Markets, as well as the benefit from deposit growth and repricing in Consumer & Wealth
Management.
Importantly, as I have noted in the past, our overall results are less sensitive to lower interest rates than many
traditional banks. Our balance sheet is modestly asset-sensitive, given our mix of high turnover or floating rate
assets and predominantly hedged or floating rate liabilities. Nevertheless, even if interest rates remain low, we
expect NII to gradually expand over time given our ability to prudently grow loans and further reprice consumer
deposits.
Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was
$112 billion, down $5 billion sequentially, driven by a $7 billion decrease in corporate loans from paydowns in
relationship lending and a $1 billion reduction in Marcus installment loans, offset by modest growth in wealth
management and credit card loans.
Our provision for credit losses in the third quarter was $278 million, meaningfully lower than the $1.59 billion taken
last quarter and down 4% versus a year ago. This lower provision versus the second quarter reflects relative

stability in our portfolio and improvements in the broader economic backdrop, which is the dominant driver of
inputs to our modeling of pool reserves. At quarter-end, our allowance for credit losses for both loans and
commitments stood at $4.3 billion, including $3.7 billion for funded loans.
Our allowance for funded loans was stable versus last quarter at 3.7% for our $100 billion accrual portfolio,
including an allowance for wholesale loans of 2.8% and for consumer loans of 16.1%. The provision of $278
million includes wholesale impairments of approximately $230 million, primarily relating to select credits in the
TMT, industrials and natural resources sectors. During the quarter, we've recognized firmwide net charge-offs of
$340 million, resulting in an annualized net charge-off ratio of 1.3%, up 40 basis points versus last quarter.
Next, let's turn to expenses on page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses of $6 billion increased 6% versus
last year with compensation expenses up 14% year-over-year amidst higher revenue growth, net of provisions,
and non-compensation expenses down 2%. Higher compensation expense reflected year-over-year growth in
revenue, net of credit provisions. Our non-comp expenses were slightly lower versus last year as we continued to
invest in new businesses, including transaction banking and credit card, as well as the United Capital acquisition,
now rebranded Personal Financial Management.
While we benefited from lower expenses of approximately $100 million from the temporary reduction in travel,
entertainment and advertising expenses due to COVID-19, we also saw an approximately $90 million reduction in
litigation and professional fees and a roughly $50 million reduction in double occupancy-related costs from our
new facilities in London and Bengaluru. These were offset by roughly $60 million increase in activity-related
expense from brokerage, clearing and exchange fees, as well as a roughly $85 million increase related to
technology investments across the firm.
Our reported year-to-date efficiency ratio was 69.6%, which was burdened by nearly 10 percentage points of
litigation expense. We continue to make progress on our expense savings initiatives as set forth at Investor Day
and will continue to assess our ability to go further than what we outlined in January. Finally, our reported tax rate
was 28% for the year-to-date, reflecting the impact of non-deductible expenses. As noted previously, we expect
our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately 21% over the next few years.
Turning to our capital levels on slide 13, our common equity tier 1 ratio improved to 14.5% at the end of the third
quarter under the standardized approach, up 120 basis points sequentially. The improvement was driven primarily
by earnings, as well as lower market RWAs, reflecting reduced market volatility and lower credit RWAs. Our ratio
under the advanced approach increased 110 basis points to 13%, also on earnings and RWA reductions from
lower market volatility.
We are confident in our capital position, now 90 basis points above our 13.6% Stress Capital Buffer requirement.
Looking forward, we continue to believe that the 13% to 13.5% standardized CET1 target range provided at
Investor Day is appropriate for our firm on a medium-term basis, as we execute our strategic initiatives, build
more durable fee-based revenues and reduce the stress loss intensity of our business. To that end, we will
continue asset harvesting, including our announced sale of Global Atlantic.
While our capital ratio will likely remain elevated near-term, given continued regulatory restrictions on share
repurchases, we would expect our management buffer to decline over time, particularly as markets express less
volatility. Importantly, we stand ready to commit capital and balance sheet to support our clients, and we expect to
resume share repurchases, once permitted, consistent with our longstanding capital management policy.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
Turning to the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.1 trillion, roughly flat versus last quarter. We
maintained very high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging $302 billion, up modestly versus
last quarter, reflecting the current backdrop. We expect our GCLA will evolve in the context of client demand for
our balance sheet and overall market conditions.
On the liability side, our total deposits decreased to $261 billion, down $8 billion versus last quarter, driven by
planned roll-off of higher cost brokered deposits and more modest growth in retail deposits. Our long-term debt
declined by $9 billion during the quarter, driven by maturities. We expect issuance to remain relatively low for the
remainder of the year, although we may consider pre-funding some planned first quarter 2021 issuances.
In conclusion, our strong third quarter results reflect the diversification of our client franchise, resilience of our
business model and flexibility in our highly liquid balance sheet. Despite the continued overhang from COVID-19
and challenges from the work-from-home environment, we continue to leverage our technology platforms and
intellectual capital to support our clients. During this difficult time, we remain dedicated to executing our strategy
in our core business and driving forward the new initiatives and operating efficiency programs we laid out in
January.
Importantly, we have been proud to see our dedicated client engagement efforts continue to pay off, resulting in
gains in mindshare and market share, as we help clients navigate this volatile environment. On the forward, our
risk managers will remain in a conservative posture, given the uncertain trajectory of the virus and early stages of
the recovery, to ensure we are well-positioned to proactively support our clients. While our path to our medium-
term targets will inevitably not be a straight line, we remain confident that execution of our strategic plan will drive
better client experience, more durable revenues and higher returns for shareholders over time.
With that, thank you again for dialing in, and we'll now open the line for questions.

So, obviously – hello. So, obviously, great – great trading results. I'm curious if you could characterize any – how
you think about any incremental risk you take to execute all that and if there's any impact on future stress tests.
I'm just looking to balance client franchise with any risks associated with it. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure, Glenn. Thanks. So, I would say the performance of the trading businesses in the third quarter, frankly like it
was in – throughout most of the first part of the year, was really done with an eye toward high velocity turn on
balance sheet. That is we were very well-prepared to commit capital to facilitate intermediation, but saw our
mission equally as moving and trading on that risk very efficiently, and so we could see the kind of turnover that
we needed. We didn't see dramatic pick-up in risk occasioned by that pattern and that strategy. And I think that
leaves us in a good position with respect to what we will submit as part of the second version of CCAR, and I
don't see our risk as being unusually elevated in the context of producing these kinds of results.

Well, God bless. That's great. And then I missed it, I don't know if you gave us the realized versus unrealized split.
I think I wrote down everything you said on the equity – and I'm talking equity investment line. I couldn't tell how
much of it was actually realized. And the lead – or the follow-on to that is, have you considered monetizing more
with markets at all-time highs, you have a pretty seasoned portfolio with two-thirds in the four to eight-years-old-
plus range? So, I'm looking to see how you balance the capital intensity of those investments with the earnings
power and what your capital deployment options are right now. Thanks.

Sure, sure. No problem. So, let me just go through the breakdown in equity. So, of the $1.4 billion in revenue, our
public portfolio generated $781 million in revenue and the private part of the equity portfolio generated $642
million. Now, importantly, when you look at the private portfolio, $284 million of that $642 million was generated
on events, so that's sales, monetizations, IPOs and the like; and $52 million, only $52 million was non-event-

driven, that is looking at the baseline performance of the underlying company and making a judgment about
where value is appropriately pegged. And so, event being the dominant component of the private portfolio. The
balance, I should point out, of $306 million, relates to CIEs.
As it relates to the public portfolio, we observe the market no differently than you do. Obviously, there's a certain
component of that public portfolio that remains restricted, a decent amount of it remains unrestricted, and we will
look for opportunities, as we have been, to monetize those stakes. By the way, I say that not just simply in the
context of an attractive market valuation in which to sell, but equally in the context of the kind of broader strategic
mission we've been on, which is to lower the balance sheet intensity and capital intensity of that as we shift to
more third-party investing itself. And so, that gives you a bit of the lay of the land as to the two components to
your question.

Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Good morning, David and Stephen. Maybe sticking with the trading question, Stephen, you gave some pretty
interesting color on why you think trading revenues could be sustainable into 2021. Can you expand on those a
bit? I'm particularly interested in your point around LIBOR transition. Could you just give us more detail there and
sort of why you think Goldman is well-placed to capitalize?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So why don't I start with trading? I think at the core, our view on sustainability is not with a crystal ball and a
forward forecast as to what the opportunity set will be. It is more rooted in the fact that over the course of the year
and looking at data through the first half, we have picked up meaningful market share in and among various client
sets across all of the businesses in our trading business. And this was a very concerted effort on the part of the
leadership of that business to go at finding ourselves, moving up the ladder in the top 1,000 clients that matter to
the trading division. So, the sustainability of our performance for me is rooted more in the fact that we've picked
up share gains. We were there for clients particularly during the most volatile moments of the second quarter
across all asset classes without withdrawing. And I think it sets us up to capture whatever the opportunity set is on
the forward.
My comments in the prepared remarks is that as I look forward to the fourth quarter, we can count on any number
of issues to be the source of some volatility, whether that's US election, LIBOR transition, the trajectory of COVID,
any one of those. And part of the reason that we are at capital levels we are, part of the reason we've maintained
higher liquidity than we ordinarily would, is such that we can serve clients should that volatility occur without
putting ourselves offsides on any one of those metrics. And I think that's part of the color I'd give you both in terms

of what's sustainable and equally why we feel confident that we've put our financial resources in a proper frame to
sort of play on the volatility itself.
Just lastly on your question about LIBOR transition, we've had a dedicated team, I mean people who are 100%
dedicated to this effort from the beginning. We've put ourselves in a position where we've done issuance. We
have prepared ourselves in terms of counterparty contracts and the like. And I think we're very well-prepared.
Obviously, we don't skew in ways in which commercial banks do with LIBOR-based elements in mortgages and
the like. But in the scope of what is our business, we feel quite well-prepared for that onset.

Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Great. Thank you. Maybe switching to acquisitions again – maybe, David, this one is for you – given the frenzy at
Morgan Stanley on deals, just curious how you're thinking about M&A, maybe what businesses or initiatives would
benefit from an acquisition. And then, if you can just touch on how you think your relative currency and sort of
capital position places you to do a transformative deal.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, Christian, I appreciate the question. And of course, we laid out a medium-term plan with a set of goals. And
you and others continue to ask us about this. We're on a journey to continue to strengthen our returns and
broaden our business to create a more diverse business with more sustainable revenues over time. We now have
the business, we think, fully set up and organized after we re-segmented last year and made some changes
internally, so that the platforms that we think we can really operate from are well-positioned to grow. And this
includes our two more traditional platforms that everybody's always focused on, Investment Banking and Global
Markets, which really, for lack of a better term, is a corporate investment bank.
We have a big Asset Management platform, which is global, broad, deep, multi-product, all over the world and we
think there are opportunities to continue to grow that organically for sure. But, certainly, we consider inorganic
opportunities to grow that if we thought that they were enhancing. And then, we obviously are building a broader
Consumer/Wealth platform to serve individuals, and we certainly think there can be opportunities to accelerate the
growth of that. In fact, last year, we made an acquisition in United Capital that we think accelerated our expansion
into high net worth wealth in a meaningful way. And we've now been integrating that quite successfully.
So we continue to look broadly at things that can extend our strategy and accelerate the pace. It's clear, if you
look at the actions of others, that the market has been tolerant of tangible book value dilution in the context of
something they think is on strategy and advances the trajectory of the business. So we'll continue to look and see
if there are opportunities. But other than that, it would be hard for me to say anything more at this point.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
All right. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. First one just on the efficiency ratio, you guys beat
the 60% this quarter, and year-to-date that's the legal – you're [ph] at (00:43:17) the 60%. I guess the good
takeaway is the operating leverage clearly works in the model. But can you provide some color to maybe where
you're at in the – like the investment and efficiency in a three-year timeline? And most of it's just to help with the
expense trend line – the efficiency ratio outlook depending on how the revenue backdrop plays out ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I'll start...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah, go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
...and Stephen might give some more granular detail. But I'd say, at a high level, Michael – and I appreciate the
question – there's no question that our efficiencies benefited from an environment which has allowed us an
opportunity in some of our businesses to capture more revenues. And some of that, as Stephen highlighted, is
really due to market share gains and we think that will be more sticky. Some of it is due to the environment.
There's no question, as we looked at our kind of three-year trajectory and thinking about our desire to run the firm
more efficiently, that this environment and the crisis slowed down some of the actions we might have taken during
this year.
We've now begun to deal with some things from an efficiency perspective that we might have dealt with earlier in
the year, and we then have two more years to go through and execute that plan. We continue to be very
committed to that plan. We continue to be very comfortable with that plan. We actually think there might be things
that we've seen and we've learned that may create more opportunities for us to advance from that plan. But at this
point, our intention is to give you a more detailed granular update when we review our plan in January at the next
earnings call.
I mean, Stephen, is there anything you'd want to add to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Mike, the only thing I would add to David's comment is that I think that on the forward, we're going to continue to
look at strategic value locations as areas where we can grow and develop a number of different businesses,
particularly the newer ones. I would say automation continues to be a priority for us across the whole of the firm,
automating what goes on in risk and the various control functions and equally automating platforms that have
captured the attention of client sets.
I'd also say that, look, it's hard to look at one quarter as a spot for efficiency. Obviously, it's important to look out
the whole year. But equally, this is a medium-term journey that we're on. And I think some of the items that I
mentioned, that David mentioned, will bear fruit in terms of creating greater operating leverage.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
The last thing I'd say is that, we have said on prior earning calls that it's important to look at operating expenses in
totality, because as we continue to build businesses like transaction banking, like the consumer business, they
will be less human-intensive, they will be more automated and, therefore, we move away from the compensation
intensity associated with those businesses as a general matter. So I think there are number of levers to pull over
the medium-term.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
All right. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on Glenn's Asset Management question. One of the things we've
seen with some of the private companies is they've been slower to rebound, given the economic backdrop. So
any insight you can provide on the private portfolio companies, either those facing more like COVID-related
pressure or those that aren't, and if that will have an impact on the pace of monetization?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So as we looked across the portfolio, and we did it in the first quarter, did it in the second and again did it in
the third, we look at those that are most acutely impacted by COVID. Their circumstance in some sense hasn't
changed and they remain kind of untouched from the downward mark pressure and valuation that we saw in the
first and second quarter. There are others that have turned the corner as being affected by COVID, and that is as
much a function of where the market is moving, where consumers are moving and the like. And then, there are
others that historically have been untouched by this.
And so, I would say we continue to look at it through the frame of COVID impact, and equally we look obviously at
the underlying performance of the business and not exclusively as against public market comparables and the
like. And by the way, this is of course for that part of the private portfolio not otherwise marked, given other events
that are going on. And so, that frame remains the same in terms of how we look at that portfolio itself.

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, good morning. This is Manan Gosalia on for Betsy Graseck. I wanted to ask on your capital levels, I know
you've said you expect to manage to about a 13% to 13.5% CET1 ratio over time. But can you speak to where
you expect to maintain capital in the near-term, at least until the 2021 stress test? Do you expect to maintain the
same buffer over your required minimum, as you did this quarter? I know you mentioned that you could see
strong activity in the markets in 4Q with the elections and the market rebound. Is there more room to be a little bit
more nimble and maybe increase exposure and market RWAs in the fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So I think we've brought our CET1 ratio to 14.5% really to sort of fix ourselves in a competitive position in
anticipation, as I said, of the potential for volatility and higher trading over the course of the fourth quarter. We've
said before and I'll say again that we run roughly with a 50 to 100 basis point buffer.
Where within that range we stand? Obviously, at the higher end now is equally a function of volatility from a risk
management point of view. That is, we're in a market that is more likely to express higher, not lower. As and to the

extent that that volatility subsides, we will see the buffer come down and we'll adjust again consistent with where
we are.
On the longer-term trend, over the medium to long-term, the reinforcement of 13% to 13.5% is more a reflection, I
think as I've said in the comments, of a forward direction to create and, as David noted, lower stress loss impact
in the overall composition of the business.
Meaning, as we continue to pursue certain of our strategic initiatives which create more durable fee-based
revenue, lower capital intensity, lower balance sheet intensity, we'll be in a position where, I think, the requirement
of us will come down. And, therefore, over the medium-term, we'll move more in that direction.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. And could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the M&A advisory front? We're
seeing the announcements come through, both your own and the industry M&A announcements have been pretty
strong in the third quarter. Can you give us some more color on what you're hearing from corporates and
sponsors, and how long do you think this increase in announcements can persist into next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So there's no question that earlier in the year, given the dramatic nature of the start of the pandemic and the
uncertainty that persisted, M&A activity came to a screeching halt. And really through the second quarter, new
announcements and activity levels were quite low. Stephen made comments with respect to the pick-up in our
backlog. We've seen an increase in activity. I think we see an increase in activity and announcements, but also an
increase in dialogues. And I would say that CEO confidence has improved meaningfully in the quarter. It's still not
at the high elevated levels it might have been at the beginning of the year, but CEO confidence in the dialogues
we're having has certainly improved.
Against that backdrop, I would expect to see numerous companies trying to take advantage of the opportunity to
consolidate and strengthen position. I think one of the things that's going on in the crisis is people are seeing that
there continues to be efficiency and scale. As the world continues to digitize, it requires greater investment. And
that obviously advantages companies with scale. So, our base case, based on what we're seeing, is that this
increase in activity will continue through the rest of the year, into 2021. But I would say that you've got to be
flexible and understand that if for some reason the course of the pandemic or the economic trajectory change
some of that confidence that's currently building, that could slow down. But at the moment, activity levels appear
quite good.

committed to those goals. So, that's encouraging certainly in light of some of the stories we've seen in the press
which were a little confusing. But I wanted to, number one, confirm that the – that's a refute of the press reports
that you all are considering backing away from the targets and also hear how loan and deposit growth experience
through 2020 has compared to your pre-pandemic expectations? And how long should we think about a headwind

likely to be? Thanks.

Okay. So, a couple of things. First – and I just want to be very clear about it. It's one article. I saw the article. The
article was wrong. It was incorrect. We've never considered changing our targets. There's been no discussion
about it. And so, we're committed to our targets and we're making progress on our targets. And so, I don't have
anything really else to say about the article other than it was incorrect. With respect to the second part of your
question – and I'm sorry, I'm now on the third part of your question where you're asking about deposits. There
was something in the middle, right?

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, when you look at deposits – that's right, deposit growth and loan growth. When you look at deposit
growth, what I'd say, and we talked about this in last quarter's call, deposit growth and the acceleration of our
ability to attract digital deposits definitely accelerated during this year because of the pandemic faster than we had
expected. We've obviously been managing that flow, and you saw in this quarter based on actions we took, that
we slowed down the growth in that deposit rate because we had well exceeded what we expected to do from the
year.
At the same point in time, when you look at the consumer business, which still remains very, very small, as we
entered the pandemic, we had the ability to be more controlled on the growth of that portfolio. We remain
committed to the targets we set out in our Investor Day in January, but it didn't seem as we were entering the
pandemic and there was such uncertainty during the bulk of this year that we should be leaning in toward driving
those targets. My expectation would be if the economic environment continues to improve, you'll see an

improvement in that loan growth as we head into 2021. But we'll continue to monitor that appropriately and
cautiously.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
That's clear. Thanks. And then, when we think about the expense side, comp clearly had a big benefit here this
quarter. Is the best way to look at that year-to-date? I know the fourth quarter is an important one for when you
guys true-up the pool and consider competitive dynamics and the like. But any additional color you can provide
there? And when we think about comp ratio, should we think about it net of provision or gross? You referred to – I
think, Stephen, you referred to it net of provision in your prepared remarks. But in prior times, it was referred to as
gross. So, just wanted to try to square that a bit. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
At a high level – so, Brennan, at a high level – and Stephen may comment on this too, but at a high level, as we
develop different businesses, and Stephen pointed to this, we're developing businesses that have a different
component of people cost than some of our businesses had had historically. And so we always when we set a
comp ratio, we are always thinking based on the information we have at the time, what do we think is necessary
to pay our people competitively and protect our franchise? PCLs are a cost of doing business. It's a reflection of
the capital that's embedded in the business. And it obviously affects that judgment. In a year where there were
very, very low PCLs, the difference between those two ratios is very little. In a year where there are very
significant PCLs, given the nature of the time we're on the cycle, obviously, there's a big difference. And that will
weigh more heavily in those years.
But we continue to see real operating leverage in our business as we execute on our strategy, as things continue
to digitize and we continue to automate. But, in addition, we have excellent people in a number of businesses that
need to be paid when people perform. And we'll stay very, very focused on making sure that we're competitively
and well-positioned. But you've seen some of the operating leverage come through on the business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I mean, Brennan, I would just point out that through three quarters when you look at comp as a percentage of
revenue net of provisions, we are spot on to where we were last year. And so there's obviously no change in
philosophy. I think David gave you all the reasons why it's important that we take stock of provisions in the context
of looking at that.
I would say though more generally, it's important to focus on the efficiency ratio of the firm over an extended
period of time, because as I said earlier, comp will be inevitably but one component of a set of operating
expenses by which the firm is carrying itself. And so I think efficiency ratio will be a better indicator of the firm's
ability to manage. But that's not to ignore the focus and the view into comp as an expense. And so I think part of
what David and I have told you gives you a sense of how we're looking at it relative to provisions and where it sits
on a year-to-date basis.

Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First question, just want to touch on the stock for a
moment. Just looking at the stock, the price was down $20 year-to-date, book value is up about $10, you put
1MDB behind you, you get a record EPS quarter today. And so just want to think a little bit about how you guys
talk about the stock price internally? You essentially have laid out a transparent plan for the business, you've set
long-term initiatives that imply a business shift towards higher multiple areas. And so I'm just curious if the
mentality is that as you execute on the plan over time, the price will just take care of itself or maybe getting to a
point where it makes sense to take more of a stand around the stock just given that it has implications for how you
run the business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I think, Devin, you've laid this out very well. We put out a plan, we believe we're executing, we've got a lot
more work to do. If we execute, I assume the stock will follow. And we're focused on shareholder value, we're
focused on the medium to longer term and I feel good – we feel good as a leadership team as to how we're
progressing. But there's more work to do and our assumption is if we continue to deliver consistently over the
medium and longer term, shareholders will benefit and the stock price will perform.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks, David. And then just a follow-up here on the Consumer business. There were several changes to
leadership in Consumer and Wealth during the quarter. I'm just curious if that implies any focus and shift in the
business or just any color around implications there to strategy or how the business is run?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So there's no focus and strategy or how the business should be run. One of the things that I believe very strongly
and that we've been driving toward as a management team since we took over as a management team two years
ago, was getting the way we talk about the business to be set up in a way we could transparently talk about our
different big business platforms and to have those businesses aligned with the way we were running the business
internally. That is not something that traditionally we had. We had external segments. We had different divisions
internally.
We made segment shifts at the end of last year to set up the platforms the way we expected to run them and the
announcements we made now get people who are driving the strategy moving those platforms forward, aligned
with the way we talk about the businesses to you, to the investment community, to our shareholders and we feel
that's an important step forward. So there's no change but rather just a continuation of the journey we've been on
to get the firm lined up and set up now with these four big platforms that we really think we can drive growth over
time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Devin, the only thing I would add just to touch on the specifics of performance within the Consumer business, so
overall the Marcus unsecured loans closed the quarter at a lower balance than where it began the year, and
Apple Card balances were higher than where we ended the year. Both of those very purposeful in the context of
managing through a young portfolio in an uncertain moment with respect to the consumer.

I would also say that the loss behavior, if you will, or the credit behavior of that portfolio is outperforming our
modeled expectations. That is, losses have been coming down relative to that which was otherwise budgeted or
forecasted, which is as much of a function of how we've managed underwriting on the entry, how we've managed
customers under customer assistant plans and the like. And so that just gives you a sense of where performance
lies in the context of David's comments.

Hi. I think my question is rooted in my business school class when I read In Search of Excellence and it says stick
to your knitting. I'm not sure if you recall that old book, and maybe it's just too ancient. But when I look at your
business, the capital markets side, I mean you're clearly gaining wallet share. It reminds of 2009 when you were
successful in supporting your customers through the last recession. And on the other hand, the expansion
businesses, buying into credit cards, one concern I hear is you're just buying into a lower P/E activity. You
certainly seem committed on that debt strategy but it seems like there's still questions there. So specific questions
on the side where there's a lot more confidence, the legacy businesses of capital markets, your M&A backlog,
how does that compare to the all-time high?
And trading, by how much has the wallet share gain been due to the environment because VIX is so high versus
new business? So that's on the positive side. And on the less confident side, the growth, what do you bring when
you buy a credit card that the seller wasn't providing before? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, there was a lot there, Mike. And so if I – I appreciate all the questions – if I don't get them all. I just want to
highlight, I don't remember the book because I didn't go to business school but as I try to tick through and answer.
First, on M&A backlog and I think Stephen said this, while M&A backlog strengthened during the quarter, it's not
back to where it was at the beginning of the year. And it's certainly not at its all-time high.
With respect to market share gains in Global Markets, I think the market share gains – we believe, as a
management team, that the market share gains are rooted in an evolution back of our strategy to really being
very, very client-centric, a One GS approach and really trying to think about how we as an organization deliver for
our clients in a very central way and this is core to the way we're running the whole firm, it's been a big initiative
over the last two years, and we think it's having a real impact in the way our clients interact with us and our ability
to serve our clients. And we think that's helping our market shares.
Certainly, the volume levels, I think, at this moment in time, are elevated. The overall activity levels are elevated
to some degree based on the pandemic and the volatility in markets. But I think the market share is coming from
the way we're executing a strategy. And we began that focus well before COVID. We began that focus two years
ago, and I think we're really getting results from that investment.
The third thing, with respect to the credit card business, it's hard to imagine wherein any business that has a lower
P/E than the current P/E that we trade at. But when you look at our vision for what we're trying to do in building a
digital consumer platform that marries our strong expertise in wealth while also providing a digital experience for
general banking services for consumers, we're committed to it. We believe in it. But we want to be perfectly clear.
This is something that's going to be built over a long period of time, just like we now sit today with an

extraordinary Asset Management franchise, where we have over $2 trillion of assets under supervision. That's
been built over a very long period of time, and we believe it's really accretive to the value of Goldman Sachs and
our shareholders over a very long period of time. And so we're going to continue to work at this cautiously. I know
there's skepticism out there. We're going to prove over time as to why we think it's right. We'll continue to advance
it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q

And I'm going to ask you a question that's not really your responsibility, but it goes back to the earlier question.
On a day like today and last quarter, the market seems to be giving you a P/E of 1 or even less on your earnings.
And I think there's a disconnect between the lumpiness of your capital markets revenues with the annuity-like
nature of your customer relationships. So I'm not sure if there's any way that you could put in context the recurring
nature of the bulk of the capital markets activity, even while parts are lumpy. And that's – I think some
shareholders are very frustrated as it was reflected by the earlier question. And so I know your view is, look, stock
prices follow earnings, you've had a focus on growing book value, let's grow book value, and everything else will
take care of itself. Is that still the way you think about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I think your last statement is true, but I'll make a couple of other comments at a high level. And it would offer
a perspective, and I know, Mike, you'd have a perspective on this too. But for sure, we're going to continue to
focus on performing, and I think over time it will take care of itself. At a high level, the banking sector and
financials broadly are well out-of-favor, and so it's not as though we're sitting in a unique position. If you look at
the people that you would benchmark us against and you look at how they trade on a relative basis, people are
pretty clustered in the neighborhood. Is that something that I think is permanent? No, I don't think it's permanent.
Can you and I both speculate as to reasons why people feel that way at this point in the cycle and with some of
the uncertainty? Absolutely.
I do think, to your point, the client franchise and the capital markets' revenues that we have are, if you're looking
at it not quarter to quarter, but over periods of time as a franchise business, there is volatility in it compared to
some businesses. But over any meaningful period of time, they generate lots of revenues, lots of earnings very
consistently. So part of it depends on the frame through which you look. And we could certainly go back over long
periods of time and see how the client franchise and the strength of the client franchise continues to do well.
So we really believe when we focus on clients, that revenue will be sustained in the context of the market
opportunity. As a business, we operate in a business that might have more short-term volatility than some other
businesses that are out there that people benchmark in some way.
I think it's an interesting time because of the pandemic and the uncertainty. So I think that hurts the overall
neighborhood. But I continue to believe that we have big platforms, we have scale, we have leadership positions.
Those things are sticky. The things that we do are not going to go away. And if we focus on our clients and
delivering for shareholders over time, I believe the stock price will follow.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A

Mike, an interesting development, just to amplify on David's comment, which is that even in the trading
businesses, which one could argue are volatile in the context of the market, on certain of the electronic platforms

that we're seeing, and I would speak specifically about the credit platform, we are seeing an increasing number of
our clients come to those platforms, transact on those platforms. Now, that may be a function of work from home
and the disposition of those clients, but we're seeing a growing presence.
Their attachment to those platforms, whether it's Marquee or otherwise, is sticky and tends to stay there, perhaps
even more than what you might see in a high-touch versus low-touch. And getting into that in the business that
you would not otherwise expect to be as predictable, if you will, I think is just something to take note in the context
of your question.

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks. A quick question on the CET1 ratio. I know there was kind of meaningful reduction in the RWAs
quarter-on-quarter and then I heard you talk about some of the environment just being probably seasonality
impacting that. But can you guys tease out the change in the RWA between what was more seasonality activity
versus where you actively managed those RWAs lower to ensure you got over your ICB minimums?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So I think on one hand, if you look on a year-over-year basis, it's a question of volatility. So we'd see it
higher than not by virtue of volatility. Otherwise, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, you see the positional set change,
reduced exposure, certain diversification effect which plays to the positive. So there was no meaningful uptick in
risk in the context of where RWA deployment otherwise was.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then when you think about the CET1 ratio targets that you're running to, obviously, that assumes the
SCB would improve for you from here. So what are, kind of, some of the actions that you're taking for it to get the
SCB lower so that you can run at a 13% to 13.5% with a management buffer over the near-term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen M. Scherr A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Well, I think, over the medium-term, I think if you look at the various initiatives that we articulated at Investor
Day and are executing on now, whether it is transaction banking, the consumer business, what we're doing with
respect to our alt business, all of those will reduce the stress loss intensity of our business overall. Transaction
banking will be a fee-generating proposition. The alternatives business equally will give us a more durable thread
of fees and, at the same time, take down the capital and balance sheet intensity that otherwise weighs on the
capital calculation. So I think all of those are geared with an eye toward reducing down, as I said, stress loss
intensity and ultimately leading to a lower SCB itself.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
Hey, good morning. I appreciate the commentary around M&A and maybe the spillover impact on acquisition
finance. But if we think about what's been going on this year in terms of significant capital raising, both equity,
DCM, how do we think about that going forward? It sounds like you've replenished some of the coffer in terms of
the pipeline. How much demand is there to shore up balance sheets and for capital markets activity? Or is it kind
of a yin and a yang where M&A picks up and capital raising comes down and we don't really grow banking much?
Just trying to think through that level of activity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, Jim, I think it's a hard thing to look at and predict with granularity. There's no question that the environment
pulled forward – both pulled forward some financing for companies and also created a whole bunch of financing
that if we didn't have this environment, it wouldn't have happened. And so, there's no question that financing
levels have been elevated during this year.
At the same point in time, if again – and this goes back to my point as people think about this – if we get out of the
mode of kind of thinking quarter to quarter to quarter and we look at these as huge franchises, we have leading
share and we're well-positioned. I believe, over any period of time, 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, 10 years, there's
going to be enormous corporate financing activity and we will have leading share in participating in that, and that
will be a big, profitable business that will enhance our franchise and help drive earnings growth and book value
growth.
And so, in the short-term, it's hard for me to speculate. I mean I would speculate that if things normalize, which I
expect them to, we will not see the same velocity of financing in 2021 that we saw in 2020, as people try to adapt
and finance themselves out to create more runway, given the uncertainty and environment. And so, again, big
franchise, big opportunity and whatever the market puts forward, I think we're well-positioned to serve our clients
and capture it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Well, maybe as a follow-up too on that, just maybe you could update us on your efforts to kind of expand market
share. You talked about going down-market into the middle market. How has the progress been on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I appreciate that question, Jim. The progress is going quite well. And I think one of the things that I know is self-
evident to everybody on the call, as market cap grows, there are more and more companies that grow into being
worth $500 million, $1 billion, $2 billion, that have never been on our radar screen. So that footprint has expanded
meaningfully and there's been hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue accretion based on the opportunity set
that's come from that, and I think that will continue. So I feel good about the way that platform expansion is going,
and I think there continues to be more opportunity for us over time to continue to add to that footprint.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
Hi. What is your appetite for asset management acquisitions? Along with that, I know you mentioned ROE and
ROTCE. You've always been very cognizant of having a lot of goodwill and you don't have so much. So what's
your appetite for asset management deals and what's your appetite for goodwill? And do you still have the same
focus on ROE as much as ever?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I think, Mike, that I'm not going to say anything in response to this that's different to what I said just a few minutes
ago. We're making investments to grow our Asset Management business organically. Certainly, the strategy
we've laid out, and alternatives and the mix shift and the way we're approaching that is an organic effort. We
certainly are aware of the continued consolidation that's going on in the asset management industry.
We feel very well-positioned as a very, very large, global, broad and deep, active asset manager. As opportunities
come up, we'll consider them if we think they can enhance our franchise and allow us to expand the strength of
our franchise and our ability to serve our institutional clients and also individual clients through our Wealth
business.
To the degree that we thought something would really enhance our ability to drive that platform, we would take on
the goodwill that was necessary to do it. We're not afraid of that. We haven't seen the right opportunity for us at
the moment and so we'll continue to grow the business organically. If the right thing came along inorganically, we
take a very hard look at it.

Stephen M. Scherr

Okay. Since there are no more questions in the queue, I'd like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the
call. On behalf of our senior management team, we look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming
weeks and months. If additional questions arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Heather.
Otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter call in January.
