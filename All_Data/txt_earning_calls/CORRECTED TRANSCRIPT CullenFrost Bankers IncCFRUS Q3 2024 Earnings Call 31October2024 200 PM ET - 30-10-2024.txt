Q3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Phil.

Phillip D. Green
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, A.B. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review third quarter results for
Cullen/Frost and I'm accompanied on the call by Jerry Salinas and Dan Geddes, who've been working together in
anticipation of Jerry's upcoming retirement as CFO and they'll provide additional commentary.
In the third quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $144.8 million or $2.24 a share, compared with earnings of $154 million
or $2.38 a share reported in the same quarter last year. Our return on average assets and average common
equity in the third quarter were 1.16% and 15.48% respectively, and that compares with a 1.25% and 18.93% for
the same period last year. Average deposits in the third quarter were $40.7 billion, down just 20 basis points from
$40.8 billion in the third quarter of last year.
Average loans grew by 11.8% to $20.1 billion in the third quarter, compared with $18 billion in the third quarter of
last year. We continue to see solid results resulting from the hard work of our Frost bankers and the extension of
our organic growth strategy. As was the case in previous quarters, Cullen/Frost didn't utilize any FHLB advances,
brokered deposits or reciprocal deposit arrangements to build insured deposit percentages or to fund liquidity. So
again, as you look at our balance sheet, what you see is what you get.
We continue to see excellent results in our organic growth program For our Houston expansion on a combined
basis, what we call Houston 1.0 and Houston 2.0, we stand at 99% of our deposit goal, 139% of our loan goal,
and 118% of our new household goal. For the Dallas market expansion, we stand at 119% of deposit goal, 195%
of loan goal, and 170% of our new household goal. We have the first three of our new Austin expansion project
open for three locations with three more planned to open before the end of this year and early results there
continue to be very encouraging and in line with the other expansion markets.
At the end of the third quarter, our overall expansion efforts continue to grow and had generated $2.3 billion in
deposits, $1.6 billion in loans, and added more than 55,000 new households. As we've mentioned, the success of
the earlier expansion projects are funding the current expansion and we expect the overall expansion project will
be accretive to earnings beginning in 2026.
In our consumer business, we had our best quarter of the year in customer growth, adding over 7,300 net new
checking households. We believe checking household growth remains industry leading at 6% year-over-year in
an extremely competitive deposit environment. That growth has been achieved without the use of direct cash
incentive programs and used by many of our competitors. Our focus instead has been on top quality service,
great technology and a convenient expanding network of locations.
Consumer deposits overall continue to recover and finished the quarter with a 2.5% year-over-year increase or
$464 million. Finally, in area of consumer, average consumer loans grew $574 million or 21% year-over-year,
making this the ninth consecutive quarter with an annual growth rate of over 20%. This exceptional loan growth
comes primarily from our second-lien home equity and home improvement products, as well as our new mortgage
product.
The investments we've made in organic expansion, new products, marketing, technology and our employees are
helping drive this outstanding growth across our consumer business. We funded $55 million in mortgage loans in
the third quarter. And at quarter-end, our total mortgage portfolio stood at $179 million. Looking at our commercial

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024
business, average loan balances in the third quarter increased 10.1% versus the same quarter last year. CRE
balances grew by 13.7%, energy balances grew by 10.2%, and C&I balances increased by 4.8%.
Our growth in new commercial relationships in the third quarter was strong, increasing 8% over the same quarter
last year. New loan commitments totaled $1.62 billion in the third quarter. That was up 3% from the third quarter
of last year. The increase came from a 2% increase in both CRE and C&I loans and a 37% increase in energy,
albeit on a much smaller base.
We saw some improvement in credit quality during the third quarter in terms of problem loan resolutions. Total
problem loans, which we define as risk rated 10 or higher, totaled $839 million at the end of the third quarter,
down 15% from the $986 million at the end for the second quarter. Credit quality is good by historical standards,
with net charge-offs and non-accrual loans, both at healthy levels. Net charge-offs for the third quarter were $9.6
million compared to $9.7 million last quarter and $5 million a year ago.
Annualized net charge-offs for the third quarter represent 19 basis points of period end loans. Non-performing
assets totaled $106 million at the end of the third quarter and that compared with $76 million last quarter and $68
million a year ago. And the quarter-end figure increase got us to 53 basis points of period-end loans and 21 basis
points of total assets. And the increase was primarily due to $120 million dollar credit moving to non-accrual,
which is previously identified on our problem loan list.
About 24% of our problem loans overall are tied to investor commercial real estate, slightly less than 40% are
related to C&I credits and most of the balance is in owner occupied real estate, which is closely related to C&I
loans. Regarding commercial real estate lending, our overall portfolio remains stable with steady operating
performance across all asset types and acceptable debt service coverage ratios and loan to values at levels
similar to what we've reported in prior quarters.
Investor CRE loans totaled $4.3 billion or 44% of total CRE loans outstanding, and the investor CRE portfolio
exhibited an overall average loan to value at underwriting of about 53% and our average weighted debt service at
that time of 1.42%. I continue to be encouraged by our outlook and the consistent success of our strategy for
organic growth and what I believe are the best banking markets in the US.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.

Dan Geddes
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. I would like to first thank Jerry for being gracious with his time during the transition process. I
wish him the best in this next chapter and will enjoy these next two months working with him until his retirement at
year-end. He has truly set a high bar in this role for me to strive for.
Regarding net interest margin, our net interest margin percentage for the third quarter was 3.56%, up 2 basis
points from the 3.54% reported last quarter. The increase was primarily driven by both higher volumes and yields
on loans. Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged $18.9 billion during the third
quarter, up $269 million from the second quarter, primarily due to an increase in fair value of our available for sale
portfolio. During the third quarter, investment purchases totaled just $51 million, with $49 million of the total being
municipals with a taxable equivalent yield of 5.42%.
The net unrealized loss on available for sale portfolio at the end of the quarter was $1.13 billion, a decrease of
$498 million from the $1.63 billion reported at the end of the second quarter. The taxable equivalent yield on the

total investment portfolio in the third quarter was 3.40%, up 2 basis points from the second quarter. The taxable
portfolio, which averaged $12.3 billion, up approximately $258 million from the prior quarter had a yield of 2.94%,
up 2 basis points from the prior quarter.
Our tax exempt municipal portfolio averaged $6.6 billion during the third quarter flat with the second quarter and
had a taxable equivalent yield of 4.32%, up 2 basis points from the prior quarter. At the end of the third quarter,
approximately 70% of the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF insured. The duration of the investment
portfolio at the end of the third quarter was 5.4 years, down from 5.5 years in the second quarter.
Looking at funding sources. On a linked quarter basis, average total deposits of $40.7 billion were up $223 million
or 0.6% from the previous quarter. Average non-interest bearing demand deposits were essentially flat with the
second quarter, down $20 million while interest bearing deposits increased $243 million or 0.9% when compared
to the previous quarter.
Based on third quarter average balances, non-interest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits were
33.5% compared to 33.8% in the second quarter. The cost of interest bearing deposits in the third quarter was
2.41%, up 2 basis points from 2.39% in the second quarter. While rates on interest bearing deposits decreased
slightly compared to the second quarter, we saw a continued mix shift into higher yielding depository accounts,
primarily CDs being the primary driver of the 2 basis point increase.
Thus far in October month to-date average deposits are up about $600 million above the third quarter average, a
positive trend to start the fourth quarter. With that split about one-third in non-interest bearing deposits and two-
thirds being interest bearing deposits. Customer repos for the third quarter averaged $3.8 billion, basically flat with
the second quarter. The cost of customer repos for the quarter was 3.72%, down 3 basis points from the second
quarter. The month-to-date October average balance for customer repos as of October 29 was essentially flat
with the third quarter average.
Next, looking at net non-interest income and expense on a linked quarter basis. I'll point out a couple items.
Regarding non-interest income, service charges on deposits were up about $1.3 million or 5% unannualized,
driven primarily by our organic growth of consumer and commercial accounts. In terms of non-interest expense,
salaries and wages expense was up $5.4 million or 3.6%, impacted primarily by higher head count and incentive
accruals.
Looking at capital. During the third quarter, we did buy back $20 million of our stock. For the year, we now have
purchased approximately 490,000 shares at an average price of $101.98.
I'll now turn the call over to Jerry for commentary on our full year guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Dan, and thank you for those nice words. Regarding our guidance for full year 2024, our current
projections include two 25 basis point cuts for the Fed funds rate over the remainder of 2024, with a cut in
November and December. For net interest income, we continue to expect net interest income growth for the full
year in the range of 2% to 3%.
Looking at loans on a year-to-date average basis, loans are up 11.1% compared to last year-to-date. We expect
full year average loan growth in the low double digits, slightly better than our previous guidance of high single
digits to low double digits growth. Looking at deposits , the current year-to-date average is down 2.1% compared

to last year-to-date. We expect full year average deposits to be down between 1% and 2%. That represents a
decrease from our previous guidance of flat to down 2%.
Based on year-to-date growth and current projections, we are projecting growth in non-interest income in the
range of 4% to 5%, up from our previous guidance of growth of 2% to 3%. Based on our year-to-date results and
current projections, we are projecting full year non-interest expense growth in the range of 6% to 6.5% on a
reported basis that is down from the 6% to 7% previous guidance. Regarding net charge-offs, on a year-to-date
basis, it represent an annualized 18 basis points of average loans. We expect the full year to be in the range of 18
basis points to 22 basis points of average loans. That is down from our previous guidance of 25 basis points to 30
basis points of average loans. And regarding taxes, our effective tax rate for the year-to-date of 2024 was 16.5%,
and we currently expect the full year to come in at that level or slightly lower. That's in line with previous guidance.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, thank you. We'll open it up for questions now.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment while we poll for questions. Our first question is from
Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. I was wondering, could you just talk about maybe the trajectory of the margins as the Fed forward curve
is suggesting additional rate cuts and I would assume less rate cuts and/or more gradual rate cuts and a steeper
yield curve is kind of an ideal environment for you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Peter, thank you. I think you're right that look, what we're seeing is some push and pulls here is we feel like
there's going to be opportunity to reprice our investment portfolio and our fixed rate portfolio. The unknown is
going to be as rates go down, what will deposits do? And we're hopeful we'll see continued growth in deposits and
so we think there's some opportunity there. But with such a – we do have a asset sensitive balance sheet. So as
rates go down, we will see that lowering of our yield on our floating rate portfolio. And our book we're holding at
the Fed. So yeah, I mean, I think you can see really for the fourth quarter. I think you can see just probably some
steadiness to – I don't see it moving around much that fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
And do you think – I'm not asking for specific guidance, but can you see that even with the Fed cutting rates into
next year, that the margin could increase just with the repricing benefit on the earning assets and ability to lower
deposit cost?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think there is that opportunity because we do have quite a bit of our securities portfolio maturing or
repaying into next year. And we have about $1 billion of our fixed rate loan portfolio in terms of expected payoffs,
in terms of amortizations and maturities. So there will be opportunities if you look at – if you do look at our kind of
back book of both our investment portfolio and our fixed rate portfolio. We're going to be able to pick up some
yield there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. And just one more question just on loan growth. So the loan growth has been better than peers. You've
moved the guidance to the upper end of the range. Obviously, the branch expansion build out, new client growth
is contributing. Do you think that there's this pent-up loan demand also as we get past the election and rates
move lower, that it could lead to even stronger loan growth next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
You know, Peter, I honestly think there is some pent-up demand. As we've canvassed our people, as we do every
quarter because I've visited branches and talked to our relationship managers as I do every year, looked at every
location, I think that's the most consistent theme that I have heard is there is a hesitancy for people to move
forward on some fronts, not on every front, but there's – it's the single most repeated area of why are we seeing
things maybe be a little bit slower. Why might somebody be hesitating? I think it's definitely the election.
And you know, I think regardless of which way it goes, I think the fact that it's over will just clear up uncertainty
and people will be moving forward. But as I looked at the current quarter I looked at new commitments were up
from last year about – that was about 3%. But they were down a little bit from second quarter. And now second
quarter was really strong but looked at new relationships is up 8% that was a little flattish compared to the
previous quarter. The pipeline for 90 days was in my view, a little flattish compared to the previous quarter and
even new opportunities were a little flattish.
And then another thing that we saw was that if you look at advances under revolving lines of credit, they went
from like 37.2%, I think the last quarter to 36%. So it's just this sort of eerie pause, I think. I think once we get past
the election that you're going to see underlying fundamentals continue to kick in. And as I read comments from
people who talk to customers and these were notes about them pretty much in all the cases when they said, well ,
things are slowing because of the election, it was like, well, they expect that once we got past that, they would
return to a good level. So I think you're right, there is some pent-up demand. I can't tell you how much, but I just
think it's absorbing way too much of our [indiscernible] (00:23:00) bandwidth right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Our next question is from Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Good afternoon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Appreciated the update on the outlook. I was wondering for the NII guide, what are you seeing in terms of your
early experience on the down rate deposit beta following the September cut? And can you just remind us what
your expectation is on that front as we go through the cycle?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. So our NII overall expectation is we were one of the first to go up when the rates went up. And so we're
going to be mindful of competition. But our expectations is that you'll see a similar beta going down. Right now,
the beta going up is around 45 basis points and I think you'd expect to see it on the way down. But it may take a
little bit of time to work through just because our mix this time around has a little bit more CDs. And those – the
80% of our CDs are in 90 days. So it's just going to take a quarter for that to work its way through to the lower
yielding CD rates. So I think you can expect it to be similar, but it's just due to the mix of our interest bearing
deposits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. That makes sense. And then just given your comments about the NIM for next year, if you're thinking about
maybe the potential for NIM stability or expansion next year with cuts, I would think that would be some decent NII
growth with growth in the balance sheet. Is that how you're seeing it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
We're not going to give guidance until next quarter. That's a tradition, that tradition that Jerry's held. And so we'll
maintain that. You know, I will just kind of give you just a little bit of for the remainder of this year, we do have
$714 million of our investment portfolio expected to either mature or with prepay. And those are yielding 1.77%
right now. So that's an opportunity. Whether that we will use that to stay at the Fed or go into our loan portfolio,
we'll just have to see. Again, I mentioned about $2.1 billion in 2025, those are yielding $320 million approximately.
So maybe not as much of a pickup in 2025.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay, great. And then just switching to expenses, you mentioned you tighten that expense guide to the 6% to
6.5% range, which is a bit better. As you look out into the fourth quarter and just you've given some preliminary
thoughts on how you thought about next year, is there any reason why that growth rate would accelerate? And do

you see any opportunities for that growth to actually decelerate into next year? Just given your plans on the
expansion strategy? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I don't see it decelerating, but what I would say is, again, we're not going to give guidance for next year, but we're
going to continue to invest in our people, our technology and with the customer experience. So I think that's how I
would answer that question. I don't know if anyone, Phil, any comments there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Our expansion is still going to be strong. We're going to finish up Dallas, got to lean hard into Austin next year so
you'll have that. Technology is an area that everyone is seeing increases in. I don't think we are going to see a lot
of back off from that. And we're growing. We're in great markets. So we're going to be continuing to lean into that.
As we said over the years and as you followed us, we're pretty tight on expenses. I mean, you've got to the three
people in this room. We've got to sign off on something before you hire anybody or have much of a capital
expenditure. So we're pretty requiring, but we also know that we're investing right now. It's paying off. I think our
or this organic growth that we've had is just remarkable.
And now's not the time for us to do that. But same time, we're mindful of what we spend on and we're trying to be
as careful as we can, but I think right now I'm not expecting that we're going to be slowing down in terms of our
investment into our business with expenses. But I promise you, we're not being lazy with it and we're not being –
we're not going overboard with anything. It's just stuff that we think works for us and has a really important
reason.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Appreciate that. Maybe one last one on credit. You mentioned the big improvement in problem loans this
quarter. I was just wondering what the driver was for the bump up in the reserve ratio given that if those were just
specific reserves on NPAs and you talked about the growth you had there or did something in the economic
outlook worsen a bit for you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
It wasn't an economic outlook. It was primarily that one loan that Phil had mentioned drove that. And just our – we
did have strong loan growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Got it. Thanks, guys. And Jerry good luck for retirement.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I wanted to follow up, Phil, I think in your opening remarks you talked about deposit growth and that was coming
without having to do promotional strategies and pay upfront marketing dollars to bring in deposits. Just if you don't
mind, spend some time in terms of what are the big avenues in terms of deposit acquisition today. Is this tied to
lending or just pure checking account opening? Means, I'm assuming it's a function of the branches and the
investments you made, but give us a sense of what's driving the client acquisition that's translating into deposit –
core deposit growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, well, Ebrahim, I think it's a lot of things. We've mentioned I think I mentioned in my comments that first of all
the expansion is making a big difference for us. If you just look at deposit growth, I think of the percentage growth
we had, I think 2% of that growth was for expansion. And if you look at – let's look at client acquisition in the
channels we're still – we're now – we're 55% of our client acquisition of those household acquisitions is coming
through the physical plant, come into the physical locations as opposed to online.
We've still got great online throughput for new customers. So the expansion is very solid. And that's no doubt
about it that that's helping with this outsized growth rate. The other thing, though is our customer services is world
class. I mean, it just is. And so word of mouth is a big reason driving growth as we look at the factors we rank
order. Gosh, I think it's at least 10 factors for why customers have come to us and we will do our best to get that
information as they sign up.
Interestingly, this is on the consumer side. The number one factor still is convenient location. But the second
factor is our call is for fairly soon after, fairly close to that is a recommendation from somebody's, family or friends.
And that speaks to the customer service focus that we've got and I'll add two other things to that. Our app last
time I looked was the highest rated financial app in the App Store for Apple. And so you've got to have great
technology. And one thing that we did I think you might remember us talking about the last few years is we really
hadn't leaned hard into the marketing dollars. We'd done pretty much everything else. But marketing was an area
that we really needed to build our infrastructure and our expertise, really. And we've made a lot of investment in
that to support some of this expense growth you see, and I think we've gotten better and better at targeting
customers at the right time, and that's really helping our growth.
So it's not any one thing. It really is all those things together. And then I'll also say that you we're in great markets
and we picked best sub-markets we can come up with in these like Houston and Dallas and Austin, these are
really growing markets. And so it's just – it's hitting on all cylinders. And I think we're getting better at it as we
continue to learn from our previous expansion efforts. And so, I'm really optimistic for it. It's not any one thing, it's
just discipline, hard work, and our people are doing a great job.

That's helpful. And I guess, Phil, on the lending side, give us – I mean, it's been a good year in terms of loan
growth. It sounds like you're relatively upbeat even as we come out of, I guess, elections next week. But give us a
sense of the competitive landscape. Some of the regional banks have had a time to repair their balance sheets,
great markets, but intense competition, I believe. So what are you seeing from the regional banks or the big banks
in terms of just the nature of competition? And in any of your lending, are you coming across direct lenders,
private credit that one prevalent three, four, five years ago and you've gotten your bankers are now having to
compete against.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah I would say the competition is heating up. We're seeing more proposals on deals. I think that – and just look
at CRE. I think you've got more players there. Some of the structures that we're seeing are they're just – there's
not ones that will do. I mean, it's the same old stuff, right? We've seen this movie so many times before, but it's
not as bad as it was. I would say pre-COVID. But it's loosening up and there are more players that are willing to
pay and play.
Now, I think a year ago or two, there was a lot of people who were kind of running out of money and were on the
sidelines for some of these deals, particularly commercial real estate. And so now as you see quality deals in
particular you see some structures that we just don't think makes sense. As far as other players we are seeing
private equity be a part of the market. I would say the places that I see it anecdotally are more people considering
it on the, let's say, a multifamily loan. It's coming up to maturity. It's not at stabilization yet in terms of its
occupancy numbers.
So it really can't do permanent financing. It really can't sell very efficiently. So but it's – all you got to do is get to
that point and people are releasing it's just taking longer. And so private equity might be a good solution for that
person to get to that point. And once they get there there's a lot of liquidity available for these stabilized projects.
So I'm seeing that a little bit. And I guess that's sort of the lay of the land. I don't think that on the consumer side, I
don't think competition there is kind of out of whack. I mean, we've got great growth.
[indiscernible] (00:35:47) when I say we've grown 20% in any one category for nine consecutive quarters, it
otherwise would make me nervous. But that's just a product whose time is it's the right place at the right time.
You've got people who will not give up the 3% or 2% mortgages. And if they're going to get access capital in their
house or expand their house, they're going to do it through a home equity or a home improvement or something
like that. So – and like I said, I think I said in my comments, if I didn't continue to that our average credit scores,
they're like a 754. So credit is still good and that's just happens to be the right place at the right time for that
product. And then mortgages, it's new, but it's being successful and it's we're only just around $200 million now,
but it's going to continue to grow. And so that'll be good. I hope that help and the general comments on the
market.

Hi, Catherine.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I wanted just to first circle back on expenses. I know that the fourth quarter typically has some higher expenses
just related to the restricted stock awards. Just wondering if you could remind us on typically the what that looks
like. And so maybe what a better kind of run rate is to go into as we start next year's growth rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I guess I would answer, just start that and let Dan add any color. I would almost send you back to the trend
in last year's third to fourth quarter. I kind of look at that. I think that gives you some good perspective. As you
noted in your comments, we do have some awards that by their nature get expensed immediately. So I think if
you look at that, that kind of give you a feel for kind of what those sort of that things do to our expense run rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. And I, I don't have anything else to add. I think that's a – you've nailed it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A

And again, that had a yield.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Some mid-3s.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Mid-3s. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Mid-3s. Okay. And then you mentioned that your purchases slowed little bit this quarter. Would it be your intention
to see that kind of similar pace over the next couple of quarters? Or how are you thinking about the balance of
maybe the size of the bond book?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think it's just going to depend. You know, what we've been doing is just building optionality into the – to the
balance sheet really for the last few quarters. I think it's paid off for us. I mean, we – I don't think anyone knows
exactly how things are going to go. It's kind of like my customers now let's get past the election. Let's see how the
markets respond. And I think that we'll have some optionality and decide where the value is in the market. And we
might decide to begin utilizing some of that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That makes sense. I think we're all excited to get past next week. And then maybe one last one just on fees. Fees
were really strong this quarter and your guide moved up a little bit. Can you just give us some color on what
you're seeing there and then I know you're not giving guidance for next year, but it feels like there's probably
some fee momentum just given in your expansion markets and just any kind of discussion around opportunities
you're seeing there that may improve as we move into 2025 and 2026?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
You know, I think it's really driven by our organic growth. So I think you're seeing that our fee growth is really a
function of volume. Looking into next year there could be interchange regulation that comes that comes down.
That could be a factor to the downside. So just something to keep in mind that we will as well. But again, I think
it's primarily a volume for the fourth quarter. And just to give you clarity into that yield it was around 3.2%.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
I know you're not giving guidance for 2025, but when you think of just kind of the bigger picture here of the
investment spend, I know you have done Houston 1.0, Houston 2.0, Dallas and Austin you're also focusing on
technology. I think earlier in this year, maybe it was late last year, you said kind of the 5%-ish is kind of table
stakes for not only the Texas franchise, but when one that kind of leads into innovation. But when you think about
the – I hate to say non-core because expansion is core , but when you think about after Austin, is there more
branch build out penciled in or just kind of thinking for a 2026 longer term strategy, 2050 kind of answer?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think that this is a – this kind of expansion, I'll put it that way, is going to be a part of our strategy. And I
call this strategy. It's scalable and it's durable. And what I see as we finish up Dallas and we finish up Austin and
you're probably looking at you look just say 24 months for that. I mean, just think about it. I think we'll what we'll
be doing is doubling down back into these markets that we've made these investments. I mean I think about it
sometimes, let's go a couple of years forward finishing up Dallas. We finishing up Austin by that time, the Houston
expansion, the original 1.0 will be eight years old in terms of when we first began doing that.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024
Well, Houston's grown a ton in the last eight years. And you can say the same thing about what's been going on
in Dallas, et cetera. So what I think we'll be doing is we'll be continuing to expand in those great markets,
particularly Dallas and Houston. And – but we're going to be able, instead of filling in large chunks of the market
where we just weren't present, I think it's allowing us to go where the puck is going and go to those areas where
growth has been. And let's take Houston over that eight year period, but also go where the growth is currently
going. It allow us to be in some of these markets – these location markets earlier. And I think that'll be helpful to
us. So I see us continuing to do that for the foreseeable future and I really expect us to be doing in these major
markets in Texas.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. That's very helpful. I mean, with Texas being the backdrop of in-migration of both people and
companies, is it – when you think about just kind of loan growth across in the United States, Texas is obviously
doing better on average. So if loan growth starts to accelerate, do you think pricing competition gets a little bit
even more competitive within Texas because it already has the growth in people want to double down there? I'm
thinking just more of a from a competitive standpoint, and following up on Ebrahim's question, but if loan growth
accelerates from here does pricing competition get even more intensified?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I do think that as markets heat up, yeah, I think it'll get worse around the margins. But we've dealt with that man
for so long. I mean, and through these cycles and new competitors coming in that I really don't see it really
impeding anything that that we're doing. We are one of the things that with regard to price competition, I mean, if
you look at our balance sheet and our cost of deposits, I'd really argue that we're one of the low cost producers on
input as it relates to funding. So we're able to compete on price very effectively.
The thing that we don't like to compete on and we're willing to lose deals on and I guess two thirds to three
quarters deals, we lose is structure that – we like to get paid back, right? And so that's where you will probably
see it heat up most. And that's probably where it will affect us most is because we won't – there are certain kind of
deals that we just won't do and there are certain people, for whatever reason, that will do certain deals certain
way. And we've learned over the years, there's no money in that long term.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q

Yes. All right. That's helpful. Appreciate it. Thank you.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Sorry if I missed this, but I thought I heard the opportunity for securities repricing for this year and next year, the
$1 billion of loans this year. But can you talk about what the repricing opportunity is for fixed rate loans next year?
And what rate loans are rolling off at and what rates loans are coming on at right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. It's again, I think our back book is around 5%. And so we're able to reprice those fixed rate loans at around
7.25%. And so it's around $250 million for the fourth quarter and then $1 billion in the 2025. So just to make sure I
was clear on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Sorry I missed that. And then we've had some banks talk about capital markets opening up and some
paydowns coming through on the CRE side. Is that something that you're seeing in your book, too? I know the
belly of the curve is back up, but did you see any elevated paydowns while rates were lower?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, with regards to CRE, I mean, as long as the project is stabilized and on the occupancy side, yeah, there's a
lot of money available. And we've seen really strong cap rates, and mainly talking about multifamily right now, but
some really, really strong cap rates. I talked about one last quarter that was a big success for the developer
builder. We've seen sub 6% long term rates available in the market. So there's capital available once a project
reach stabilization. That's really a challenge when you do see challenges. That's the challenge that you've got is
lease up has been slower because just I'm again I'm talking multifamily mainly because supply has been so
strong.
But people are taking these units down. It's you're just seeing in some cases less rent growth than you
underwrote. You're seeing more concessions, that kind of thing. But you are getting projects leased up. And once
y you get there, there's we're seeing that there's capital available.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
And I think that's where private credit has a place. It's kind of serving, as I'll call it, kind of a bridge if a project
needs 12, 18, 24 months. And so it's a higher priced, higher yielding, maybe less structure, but it's serving its
purpose of providing capital in the market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So it sounds like you're able to get much stronger loan growth despite some of those factors weighing on overall
loan growth in the balance sheet. So is the velocity of loans up a little bit more than before now?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 31-Oct-2024
No. I mean there's a lot of things at work. Okay. So we did a great job building our CRE portfolio with great
sponsors and great projects over the last three years. They've been performing well. They've been funding up
because we're probably the last in the capital stack. And so those – a number of those projects are still being
built. So you've got some of that. And that's true in multifamily, limited amount and office and industrial, that kind
of thing. Retail have been one of it.
So I think that's one thing that's happening. As I said, our consumer growth has been really strong. It'll be
interesting to see what happens going forward. I mean the C&I piece I think has been a little weaker the last eight
weeks maybe, and I think I really believe it has a fair amount to do with the election and the uncertainty there. I
think that will clear up.
I hope to see that continue to grow. I think commercial real estate balances will have some pressure just because
we're going to be paying down refinancing. And some of these projects are going to be sold. And we haven't built
up a lot of pipeline for some of the projects, like multifamily, for example. I don't think we've done maybe one over
the last year. So there'll be a little pressure there as those things fund up and then pay off. But we've had other
successes in that, that are still under construction, still be funding up. So it's going to be interesting to see but I
think overall our outlook post-election is pretty positive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
And just to support that I think our ability to bring in new relationships sets us apart and 54% of our year-to-date
increase in loan balance is coming from new customers that we've acquired in the last 12 months. And I think
that's an important differentiator that we're able to, to with this organic growth strategy to grow specifically in the –
in our loan portfolio.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes. You flagged the seasonal deposit change in the fourth quarter and Dan you gave us some of the numbers.
But what's the typical seasonal deposit change? And it feels like the mix is similar to what you have on the
balance sheet right now in terms of non-interest bearing and interest bearing. Is that right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yes. Yeah. What we're seeing is similar.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Historically, I guess we probably had bigger increases in the non-interest bearing just because we've got
some of the larger customers trying to strengthen their balance sheet. But I'd say that there's almost nothing that I
would say at this point there's really been consistent. There's been so much movement. And with rates going
down, we think there will be – we're thinking that deposit growth will be even better. I think we'll be able to
compete more against the money market funds, given the fact that some of them will have 100% betas.
But I think from a seasonal standpoint, as Dan quoted, we are moving in that direction. So we still feel very
strongly that the trend will continue. There's just some uncertainty about how much of it really will happen. But
we're feeling good about it at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC

generally down.

Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Not really. I mean, we've got so much cash. I think the most efficient thing for us has been use cash markets
when we have conviction. I think that there have been a lot of people who – a lot of companies who didn't have a
– that kind of liquidity. So the most efficient thing for them is to use non-cash markets. But I think there's a
premium that they're paying. So it doesn't make sense for us to pay the premium that others have to when we've
got the liquidity, when we get conviction on it. But no, we really haven't seen that there's value. I mean, they look
at it all the time, but we really haven't seen that there's value right in those positions as opposed to using cash
mortgage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. And then on service charge revenue, do you feel like that growth rate is accelerating? It just – I know
you called out a few things in the quarter, but are the new branches starting to generate fee income and is that
accelerating or am I reading too much into them?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I don't – I think it is a driver of just us bringing on new customers and so our growth in number of customers is
driving that fee income growth. Will we – so we should see as grow into Dallas and into Austin again just our
ability to grow customers will help that whether that's at a 5% non-annualized pace. That may be high.
