Gregory D. Carmichael
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. I hope you're all well and staying healthy. Earlier
today, we reported full-year 2020 net income of $1.4 billion or $1.83 per share. We delivered strong financial
results in 2020 despite the challenging operating environment brought on by the pandemic. We had several
highlights for the year. We generated record adjusted pre-provision net revenue. We maintained our expense
discipline, producing an adjusted efficiency ratio below 59%, which was stable compared to the prior year but
remains near a decade low where we generate a record adjusted fee revenue including records in both our
commercial and wealth and asset management businesses.
We also continue to generate peer-leading consumer household growth of 3% with outsized success in Chicago
and our key Southeast markets. While nearly doubling our reserves, we generated an 11.7% adjusted return on
tangible common equity excluding AOCI for the full year and generated an ROTCE of 18.4% in the fourth quarter.
Just as importantly, we have successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic keeping 99% of our branches open
for business while working closely with our customers to support them during these challenging times through the
PPP program, hardship relief programs, and other outreach efforts that we have previously discussed.
Our efforts have been noticed externally. We are recognized by an independent third-party as a top performing
bank among the 12 largest US retail banks based on our pandemic response for our customers, communities and

employees. Also, we had the honor of winning the Greenwich middle-market CX award, reflecting our
commitment to delivering a superior customer experience for and during the COVID 19 crisis.
Additionally, during the year, we published our inaugural ESG report highlighting our efforts to generate
sustainable value for all stakeholders. And just this week, we announced that we became the first regional bank to
achieve carbon neutrality in our operations.
Turning to fourth quarter, we reported net income of $604 million. Our reported EPS include a negative $0.10
impact from the items shown on page 2 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings
were $0.88 per share. Jamie will walk you through the quarterly financial results in more detail in just a minute.
Focused execution on our key strategic priorities and our disciplined approach to credit risk management continue
to drive strong financial performance. As we recently announced, we have taken decisive action to drive
efficiencies and improve the long-term profitability of the bank by streamlining our operations including divesting
less profitable businesses such as property and casualty insurance while still investing in areas of growth and
profitability.
For example, we recently finalized the acquisition of H2C, which strengthens our health care investment banking
and strategic advisory capabilities. We continue to assess select strategic investments and nonbank acquisitions
to improve fee growth. All reported and adjusted return metrics were solid and improved sequentially in the fourth
quarter, reflecting our strong operating results, including the provision for credit loss performance. We expect a
positive momentum in our operating results to continue in 2021.
Net interest income increased 1% sequentially despite loan portfolio headwinds. Underlying NIM, which excludes
excess cash and PPP impacts, increased 8 basis points sequentially. We expect to generate differentiated NIM
performance relative to peers in 2021 and beyond, reflecting the hedge and investment portfolio actions we have
taken over the past several years. Our credit quality remains solid with net charge-offs of 43 basis points stable
compared with the recent quarters. Also, our criticized assets and allowance for credit losses both declined
sequentially, reflecting our credit discipline and improved credit results and economic outlook.
We continue to benefit from the diversification and resilience of our fee-based businesses in retail, commercial,
and wealth and asset management. Many of our fee-based businesses are generating strong results that are
helping to cushion the impact of lower rates. Our robust capital and liquidity levels further improved this quarter,
indicative of our balance sheet strength. Our regulatory capital levels have increased for three consecutive
quarters as a result of our strong earnings power, balance sheet dynamics, and the Fed's temporary suspension
of buybacks.
With the partial relief announced by the Fed in December, we intend to execute up to $180 million in share
repurchases in the first quarter. Through proactive management, we have built a strong and stable balance sheet
that significantly improved the diversification of our fee revenue. We have done this all while maintaining our
culture of expense discipline and demonstrating our commitment to consistent and solid through-the-cycle
performance. Our financial performance continues to give us confidence that we can safely and soundly operate
the company at significant lower capital levels.
While our CET1 target remains at 9.5%, we will continue to evaluate the appropriate target -capital target, as the
economy improves. We're also seeing continued strength in our commercial loan production levels and our
pipelines. Fourth quarter loan production was the highest in 2020 and was down around 20% from the year-ago
quarter, but was up over 50% from the third quarter. We are encouraged by the recent trends, the sequential
4

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
improvement in almost all regions and all verticals. Strong production was more than offset by elevated payoffs
and another 1% decline in line utilization.
Our middle-market pipeline improvement is well-diversified throughout our footprint including significant strength
in our Southeast markets, and corporate banking pipeline strengthened again this quarter with improvement in
industrials, retail, health care, solar, and financial institutions partially offset by continued sluggishness in
hospitality and energy.
Based on a strong pipeline of stable utilization trends through the first three weeks of January, we currently
expect C&I loan balances to improve on the period end basis during the first quarter excluding the impact of PPP
loans. Commercial real estate pipelines continue to be well below pre-COVID levels.
Before I turn it over to Jamie to further discuss results and our outlook, I want to reiterate our strategic priorities
which will enable us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value. Our four key strategic priorities have not
changed over the past several years and include leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation,
driving organic growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies, and maintaining a disciplined
approach on expenses and client selection.
We'll put the appropriate level of prioritization and focus on areas where we see the highest probability of driving
strong financial returns and generating long-term value for our shareholders. Our balance sheet strength,
diversified revenues, and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve us well as we navigate
this environment in 2021 and beyond.
I would like to once again thank our employees. I'm very proud of the way you have continually risen to the
occasion to support our customers and each other during these challenging times. Fifth Third continues to be a
source of strength for our customers and our communities and will remain committed to equality, equity, and
inclusion for all. To that end, we made a three-year $2.8 billion pledge to this commitment through lending,
investing, and donating, including a $25 million contribution to the Fifth Third foundation.
Our financial results continue to reflect our focused execution, discipline, and through-the-cycle principles. We
remain committed in generating sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and anticipate that we will
continue improving our relative performance as a top-performing regional bank.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. One quick housekeeping item before discussing our
financial results for the quarter. As you'll see in our earnings materials, we are no longer adjusting certain metrics
for purchase accounting accretion or intangible amortization given that they largely offset and have an immaterial
impact on pre-tax income. We hope this will help simplify our disclosures going forward to more easily assess our
financial ratios.
Now, turning to our fourth quarter performance, we ended 2020 with positive momentum and delivered strong
financial results. Reported results were impacted by several notable items including a $23 million after-tax
negative mark related to the Visa total return swap, a $21 million after after-tax charge related to our acquisition
and disposition actions, as Greg mentioned, the sale of our HSA business remains in process and should close
by the end of this quarter.

Fifth Third Bancorp

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
We also recognized a $16 million after-tax charge related to our branch and non-branch real estate efficiency
strategies. This includes impairments associated with seven branches we will be closing in April as part of our
normal rigor on reviewing our network for efficiencies. These closures are in addition to the 37 branches we
announced last quarter.
Furthermore, as Greg discussed, we reported a $19 million after-tax charitable contribution expense to promote
racial equality, and we also reported $4 million after-tax from COVID related expenses. Lastly, we had a one time
favorable item related to state taxes of $13 million.
In terms of the financial highlights for the quarter, despite the nearly 160-basis-point decline in one-month LIBOR
over the last 12 months, we were able to generate an adjusted PPNR above the fourth quarter of 2019 level. We
generated an efficiency ratio of 58%. Our operating performance reflected a 1% increase in NII, a 16% increase in
adjusted fees, and a 4% increase in adjusted expenses.
Given the strong PPNR results, combined with continued credit-related improvements, we produced strong
reported and adjusted return metrics, including an adjusted ROA of 1.31% and an adjusted return on tangible
common equity of 18.4% excluding AOCI despite growing our regulatory capital 20 basis points during the
quarter.
Drilling into the income statement performance, the sequential increase in NII of 1% reflected the strength of our
balance sheet and deposit franchise. We saw a 4-basis-point improvement in our total loan yields, which was
supported by both the continued benefits from our long-duration, deep-in-the-money cash flow hedges, as well as
$10 million in additional PPP income. Our NII results included $11 million of incremental, favorable prepayment
penalties in the securities portfolio, reflecting one of the benefits from our strategy to invest in bullet and locked-
out cash flows.
Approximately 59% of the investment portfolio is still invested in bullet and locked-out cash flows at quarter end.
And our investment portfolio yield increased 9 basis points sequentially to 3.1%. Net premium amortization in our
securities portfolio was only $1 million in the fourth quarter.
On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit cost by another 5 basis points. For the fourth
quarter, the average cost of our core deposits was only 5 basis points. CD and debt maturities also provided a 2-
basis-point improvement to NIM versus the third quarter. Reported NIM was stable compared to the third quarter,
reflecting the favorable securities portfolio and PPP income I mentioned, offset by the impact of higher cash
levels. Underlying NIM excluding PPP and excess cash improved 8 basis points to 3.14%.
Once again, we had another strong quarter generating noninterest income to cushion the rate-driven NII pressure.
The resilience in our fee income levels continues to highlight the revenue diversification that we have achieved.
Total noninterest income increased 9% relative to the third quarter. Excluding the notable items, noninterest
income increased 16%.
We generated record commercial banking revenue which increased double-digits sequentially and year-over-year
driven by strength across most of the business. We also recorded TRA income of $74 million, as well as gains
from several of our direct fintech investments and venture capital funds. These investments generated $75 million
of fee income in 2020 and we expect continued gains in 2021.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Top-line mortgage banking revenue declined $46 million sequentially, driven by a $26 million headwind reflecting
a decline in rate lock volumes, a $12 million impact from our decision to retain $250 million of our retail production
during the quarter, and $8 million due to margin compression. MSR decay and servicing fees were unchanged
sequentially and will remain challenged in this environment.
While we did not deliver the mortgage results we expected due to capacity pressures, we have seen meaningful
improvement in December and January. Noninterest expenses also increased relative to the third quarter, albeit
to a much lesser extent than fees. Adjusted expenses were up 3%, excluding the mark-to-market impacts
associated with non-qualified deferred compensation, but is offset in security gains within noninterest income. The
largest contributor of the expense growth was performance-based compensation, driven by the strong
performance in fees related to business growth and other revenue-linked expenses.
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average loans declined 3% sequentially with both commercial and consumer
balances in line with our previous guidance ranges. Commercial loan balances continued to reflect lower revolver
utilization rates, which decreased another 1% in the quarter to 32%.
Line utilization rates so far in January are stable relative to the fourth quarter. We currently expect utilization to
remain unchanged for the first half of 2021 and are forecasting only a modest increase of approximately 1% in the
second half of the year as the economy improves. Average CRE loans were flat sequentially with end-of-period
balances declining 1%.
As we have discussed before, we believe that the commercial real estate sector is particularly vulnerable to the
current economic environment and supports our strategy of lower exposure and our focus on high-quality
borrowers. We have provided more information related to our CRE exposures in our presentation this quarter.
Average total consumer loans increased 1% sequentially, driven by continued growth in the auto portfolio,
partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card. We took additional action in the consumer portfolio at
the end of December to improve our NII trajectory for 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion of our excess
liquidity by purchasing government-guaranteed residential mortgages currently in forbearance under the CARES
Act provision. These loans are in our held-for-sale portfolio as they are not expected to be held for more than one
to two years. These loans provide a more attractive risk-adjusted return than other current investment
alternatives.
Our securities portfolio of roughly $35 billion decreased 1% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of
paydowns combined with the lack of compelling reinvestment opportunities.
Our investment portfolio positioning continues to support NII in the current environment, allowing for patience in
investing at the current unattractive long-term rates. Given the potential for strong economic growth in the second
half of 2021, we do not believe long duration securities are providing an appropriate risk return trade-off. As a
result, we do not expect to grow our investment portfolio in the near-term.
Our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter remained at $3.5 billion. Also, our
deliberate actions within the securities portfolio over the past several years focused on structuring the portfolio in
anticipation of a lower rate environment and should continue to give us a strong advantage as a very effective
hedging tool to help mitigate the rate headwinds.
Average other short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, increased to $35 billion, growing $5
billion from the prior quarter and $33 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. In addition to the loan growth
7

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
headwinds outside of PPP, the significant increase in excess cash reflects record deposit growth over the past
nine months. Core deposits increased 3% compared to the third quarter despite a 12% reduction in consumer CD
balances, which helped drive down interest-bearing core deposit cost by 5 basis points.
Moving on to credit. Overall, credit quality continues to be solid, reflecting our disciplined approach to client
selection and underwriting, balance sheet optimization and the improved macroeconomic environment. Charge-
offs remained well-behaved at 43 basis points. Nonperforming assets declined $67 million or 7%, with the
resulting NPA ratio of 79 basis points declining 5 basis points sequentially. Also, our criticized assets declined
12% with appreciable improvements in energy, industrial and middle market.
Given the solid credit results, lower end-of-period loan balances and improvements in the macroeconomic
outlook, our reserve coverage declined 8 basis points to 2.41% of portfolio loans and leases, with improvement in
both consumer and commercial. The low level of net charge-offs, combined with the $131 million decline in
allowance, resulted in a net $13 million benefit to the provision volume.
Our ACL decline of $131 million was attributable to several factors. Approximately one-third of the decline was the
result of lower period-end loan balances, with the remainder of the release due to both the improved economic
outlook and the improved commercial credit risk profile, which is reflected in our lower NPA and criticized asset
levels.
As is required under CECL, our reserve reflects all known macroeconomic and credit quality information as of
December 31. While we are not predicting or forecasting reserve releases at this point, given both the significant
uncertainty in the economy and our loan growth expectations, to the extent there would be meaningful and
sustained improvement in the broader economy it's not unreasonable that reserves could come down from here
even if credit losses tick up.
Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes GDP remains below 2019 levels until the end of 2021, an
unemployment rate higher than the current 6.7%, ending 2021 at 7.2% and declining to 5.6% by the end of 2022.
Importantly, our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from fiscal stimulus generally consistent with the
$900 billion package passed at the end of December, but does not incorporate additional relief as currently
proposed by the new administration.
We did not change our scenario weight of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios.
Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $200 million release to our fourth
quarter reserve. Conversely, applying of 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $900 million build.
Inclusive of the impact of approximately $136 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio,
our ACL ratio is 2.53%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit
reserve, the ACL would be approximately 2.65%.
Moving to capital. Our capital remained strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.3%,
above our stated target of 9.5%, which amounts to approximately $1.2 billion of excess capital. As a reminder, we
have remaining capacity to purchase 76 million shares from our 100 million share program authorized by our
board of directors in 2019, representing $2.4 billion or 11% of our current shares outstanding. As Greg mentioned,
we plan to execute approximately $180 million in share repurchases during the first quarter. And should the
Federal Reserve permit banks to continue to repurchase shares in 2021 under the current net income test
framework, we would have around $1 billion of buyback capacity in total for 2021 assuming no change to our
reserve coverage.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Moving to our current outlook. We have provided detailed guidance for both the full year and the first quarter,
consistent with previous fourth quarter earnings calls. We expect full-year 2021 total loans to be stable with 2020,
on both an average and end-of-period basis, reflecting the full year headwinds of commercial line utilization
declines from the second half of 2020 and PPP forgiveness, offset by the benefit of the consumer loans added at
the end of 2020 and our forecast of $2 billion of new PPP loan originations in 2021.
Average commercial balances are expected to decline in the low- to mid-single digits range compared to 2020,
while consumer balances should increase in the mid to high-single-digits range. For the first quarter, we expect
average total loan balances to increase approximately 2% to 3% sequentially, reflecting relative stability in the
C&I portfolio, continued strength in the auto portfolio, and growth in residential mortgage and other consumer
loans, partially offset by a 1% decline in CRE.
Given the loan outlook, combined with our expectations for the underlying margin to be around 3% reflective of
the structural rate protection from our securities and hedge portfolios, we expect NII to decline approximately 3%
next year; and also decline around 3% in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter assuming no deployment of
our excess liquidity. We expect noninterest income to increase 2% to 3% in 2021, which includes the 1%
headwind from lower TRA income in 2021. If not for the TRA impact, our fee expectations would be for 3% to 4%
growth, which includes the impact of approximately $40 million in foregone annual revenue associated with our
business exits as part of our expense savings program.
For the first quarter, we expect fees to increase the mid single-digits year over year, which is a 9% to 10% decline
sequentially, reflecting seasonal impacts such as the lack of TRA revenue and lighter other noninterest income,
partially offset by the seasonal uptick in wealth revenue from tax preparation fees in the first quarter and
significantly stronger mortgage revenue.
We expect top line mortgage revenue to improve $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter relative to the fourth
quarter, and also anticipate stronger results in our loan and lease syndication businesses. We expect full-year
2021 noninterest expense to decline approximately 1% relative to the adjusted 2020 expenses, driven by the
impacts of our expense reduction program, but partially offset by expenses associated with strong fee growth,
servicing expenses associated with the consumer loan portfolio purchased in the fourth quarter and continued
investments to accelerate both our digital transformation and our sales force and branch expansion in our growth
markets.
As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing
of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Compared to the first quarter of 2020 reported expenses, we expect
total expenses to be flat. On a sequential basis, excluding seasonal items, our total first quarter expenses are
expected to be down approximately 3% to 4% from the fourth quarter.
We currently expect to generate year over year adjusted positive operating leverage in the second half of 2021,
reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee based businesses, and our proactive
balance sheet management. We expect total net charge offs in 2021 to be in the 45-basis-point to 55-basis-point
range. If the proposed stimulus passes, we would expect to be at the lower end of that range.
In summary, our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress
we have made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will
continue to rely on the same principles, disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a
long term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just wanted to ask about sort of the C&I outlook. Near term, I guess I would characterize the commentary as
constructive, but yet the outlook for just I think 1% increase in line utilization in the second half, it seemed to me it
stands in a bit of contrast from some of your peers who seem to require a more robust acceleration in C&I later in
the year. I guess I'm just curious for maybe more color on how you're thinking about the potential rebound in C&I
as the economy normalizes around, say, midyear or so.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Hey, Scott. This is Greg. First of all, I'd say we were encouraged by the fourth quarter pipeline growth that we've
seen up significantly over third quarter, albeit slightly down from where we were in 2019. So, we're seeing
progress out there, and it's really – it's pretty broad-based across all of our regions and across our verticals. So,
we're encouraged by the strength we're seeing there.
Obviously, there's a lot of unknowns going in as we go into 2021, additional stimulus, the vaccines and so forth,
the recovery. So, it's a hard thing for us to gauge what the expectations are. But there's a lot of liquidity out there
right now, so we're optimistic that the vaccines could be distributed appropriately and we get our economy back in
full swing second half of the year that those numbers might look stronger. But right now, we're just being at the
end of day conservative but encouraged by the pipelines that we've seen already.

Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
No. I think that's absolutely right. As you said, I think we're particularly pleased with the pickup in middle-market
production that we saw in the fourth quarter and the continued strength in the industry verticals like renewable
energy, technology, and health care where the bank has made fairly significant strategic investments over the
course of the past several years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then just within your guidance for the full year, I know that you guys conservatively
don't include the PPP impact. Just curious however to the extent that they do come through, how are you
expecting those to ebb and flow? Will most of the forgiveness from the first round, is that expected them to be sort
of a first half event, or how do you see that flowing through?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Scott, it's Jamie. For PPP in total, NII, we expect about $150 million in 2021, which includes about $60
million in accelerated forgiveness fees, which compares to about 100 million of total NII in 2020, which included
only $10 million in accelerated forgiveness fees. And right now in our outlook, we expect first quarter forgiveness
fees to be in line with the fourth quarter. Perhaps that's – we'll do better than that from a forgiveness perspective.
We've got about $400 million or a little bit less than 10% of the 2020 originations forgiven. And so as we model it
out, we expect the majority of the fees from the 2020 originations to be forgiven in the third quarter as borrowers
approach that 16-month time horizon of needing to make payments or have it forgiven.
So, right now, we expect the back half of the year to have a little bit more accelerated fees. And then as we
mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect the 2021 round of PPP to be about $2 billion in originations, and
then that will accrue at a lower rate just given the five-year term on those loans. So, we expect about a 1.8% yield
prior to any of the forgiveness fees.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Sure. I think some of the momentum coming off of 2020 will lead to a very successful 2021 in the fee businesses.
We did grow households 3% on the consumer side, and then the investments we made and the capital markets'
offerings over the past several years, that should bear fruit in 2021. So, when you line up the fee categories for
2021, I expect high single-digit growth in treasury management and commercial banking, which does include the
capital markets business, mid-single-digits growth in consumer deposit fees, wealth and asset management, and
card and processing; and then low single-digit growth in mortgage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. So, even with the strong year, given some of that – I guess it was a capacity point you made earlier about
mortgage. You still think mortgage can grow this year. Is that just because you see production pulling through or
do you see less of the MSR drag over time? Just maybe little more color on the mortgage side. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. On mortgage in the fourth quarter, there were capacity constraints and there was the headwind from our
decision to portfolio $250 million of our retail production. Those loans will close in the first quarter, and then you
will see that show up in the residential mortgage balances in held for investment. And from there, we do expect
the capacity constraints to be behind us. And from an MSR perspective, this environment for servicing is certainly
challenging. We expect that to abate in the second half of 2021. And all-in, the low single-digit growth for 2021, I
think, is a very achievable number for us.

I wanted to ask about capital. And if you could just go over the capacity, what's left in the existing share buyback,
how much you have left. And then secondarily, if the Fed were to lift the restrictions on share buybacks, just how
you're thinking about capital returns?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Peter. In 2019, we approved a $100 million share repurchase program. We have
76 million shares left under that program. So, call it, $2.4 billion. Right now for 2021, if you assume the Fed
12

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
continues their trailing 12-month net income test and you look at our guide on earnings, you should generate
about $1 billion of capacity, assuming no additional reserve releases. And if you look at our capital from a spot
basis at the end of 12/31/2020, we have about $1.2 billion of excess, even with the loan performance that we've
had. So, I think for 2021, should the Fed open the window, $1 billion or so as I think everything triangulates to that
level.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then you guys lowered the net charge-off guidance from December. December, I think it
was 55 basis points to 65 basis points. What gives you the confidence that, like, there's nothing looming,
especially with some of these loans coming off deferral, assuming we don't get an additional stimulus package?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Hey. It's Richard. Thanks for the question. I think it really comes down to the activity we have from a risk
management perspective, the confidence we have in the underwriting, and our portfolio management. We
continue to see consumer loss rates lower than normal. We saw them lower than normal in 2020. We expect that
to continue in 2021. As the impact of stimulus rolls through the portfolio, remember, our portfolio is concentrated
in prime and super prime. We have a weighted average FICO of close to 760. So, confidence in what's happening
there from an activity standpoint.
We do expect commercial losses to tick up a little bit from the – into the high-40s, low-50s, and that's just going to
be a function of the normal migration we see in commercial. We highlighted some potential at-risk industries in the
deck. But we've seen criticized assets come down, as Jamie mentioned. We've seen positive resolutions in our
workout group. And so just given what we see in the portfolio, where we see performance re-stabilization across a
number of sectors, we have a lot more confidence in that range.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Maybe start with a question for Jamie, who I guess by now we'll call the chief cook and bottle
washer at Fifth Third. So a question for Jamie. Pretty clear on kind of the securities purchases and your thoughts
there on holding cash. I guess my question, are there opportunities to purchase loans like the government-
guaranteed loans that you had in the fourth quarter, as well as the decision to just hold more mortgages on the
balance sheet as you think about the next 12 months?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. And that's essentially what we did in the back half of 2020. In the third quarter, we repurchased our own
Ginnie Mae forbearance pool. Now, it's about $750 million that came on to our balance sheet. In the fourth
13


Fifth Third Bancorp

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
quarter, we purchased the servicer's pool to the tune of $2.1 billion, as well as taking the $250 million of retail
production and putting it on the sheet.
I think, for now, we've done a lot of work on the residential mortgage portfolio to improve it, and we think the
returns are incredibly attractive. I think, going forward, I'd like to see the loan growth be in other categories, just
given the convexity risk you have in residential mortgage and that we've done enough. So that's why we expect in
the first quarter to get back to selling all of our production.
But, again, I think the trade that we were able to execute was a nice deployment of excess cash and certainly a
far better return than just buying mortgage-backed securities. We think the ROA is 2% or so on that transaction
versus security purchases are probably 1% to sub-1% right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, just looking at the CECL allowance, I'm curious, what was behind the
increase in commercial mortgage and commercial construction? Other categories drifted lower. Those two were
up higher quarter-over-quarter, and I was hoping to get some insight there. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. It's Richard again. Look, in commercial real estate, we've seen continued negative migration. That's just a
portfolio and an asset class that has a longer tail in terms of when problems arise and a longer tail when they're
going to be resolved. So we saw criticized assets go up in that sector. And so, that, plus some qualitative
adjustments, because we don't believe that the models fully reflect the variables that are impacting some of these
subsectors like hospitality and retail in terms of the time of recovery. And so, just given the asset migration trends
and some qualitative adjustments, that drove the ACL for commercial real estate higher in the quarter.

Hi. Great. Thanks. First question. Just in terms of the NII guidance, I just want to make sure that the – or question
whether the down 3% in 2021, does that include your expectation of accelerated PPP fee income?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Thanks for the question. So we do include the $2 billion of additional 2021 PPP in our guide. I think the NII
guide of down 3%, that trajectory could improve, I guess to the point of the first question on the call today, through
higher commercial line utilization because we do assume just a small uptick in the back half of the year, and
frankly there is not much we can do about that. It's a borrower/customer demand situation.
14

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
A steepening yield curve benefit would also help. We anchor our guidance on the January 4 implied forward
curve. So perhaps we'll do a little bit better there. And should the curve steepen significantly, then we would have
opportunity to deploy excess cash.
Third, with regard to the PPP, we're assuming $2 billion of originations. And perhaps that's a conservative number
because as we sit here today, we've submitted over $1 billion in apps in just the first two days. And then finally, as
Greg mentioned, perhaps there'll be better commercial loan production through higher borrower demand and
CapEx and inventory build-ups.
And from a production expectation perspective, we're expecting 2021 commercial loan production to be up about
20% or so from 2020, but still down 7% or so from 2019 levels. So our outlook assumes improvement, but not
returning to the 2019 type of economy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. All right. And then, just my second question, I think Greg mentioned the 9.5% CE Tier 1 you want to
target currently, which I totally understand. But you did make a comment that you would kind of reconsider that as
the economy gets better. Can you just help us dimension, like, let's assume that the economy is fully better, like,
where is a good level for Fifth Third to run on CE Tier 1?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
So prior to some of the challenges that were cropping up in the environment, we had a 9% target. So should the
economy improve, as we hope it does, in the back half of 2021, 9% I think is a logical next step for us. When we
stress-test our balance sheet, we believe our balance sheet has a risk profile that could be run in the 8.5% to 9%
range. Our stress capital buffer is currently 7%, so I guess the Fed's perspective is much lower than that. But I
think for us, for this year, we're targeting 9.5% and we'll evaluate that target as we see how the economy unfolds.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Thank you. Good morning. We saw back book repricing headwinds to loan yields persist throughout the last ZIRP
cycle, and not just for Fifth Third, but across the banking system. I believe about half of your loan portfolio is
variable rate and indexed to the short end of the curve, but there's still some repricing yet to come through. Would
you expect a similar dynamic with further pressure on loan yields to come in this ZIRP cycle as well? Maybe if you
can just speak to that and maybe compare and contrast what's different about this cycle?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Well, I think that's a good observation, and we are experiencing that phenomenon, and we saw it in the fourth
quarter NIM and it's a factor in our first quarter guide. Right now, from C&I production levels, just given the floating

nature of the portfolio, yields are roughly in line, maybe 5 bps below the current portfolio. But on the consumer
side, which is more a fixed rate in nature instruments, we are seeing new production yields 25 to 35 basis points
below portfolio yields. And so, that is certainly a headwind in our NII outlook.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Understood. And separately, sorry if I missed this, but I wanted to ask about if you could give some color on new
money rates in light of the curve steepening that we've seen. On the security side, it seems like some of the
dynamics around QE have led agency MBS spreads over treasuries to turn negative, which would seem to
temper some of the benefits of the steeper curve. But I was hoping that you guys could discuss some of the
opportunities that you see there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. It's a great question, and we're seeing a divergence in practice across the banks. Our view in terms of what
the rate environment would need to progress to in order to put our excess liquidity to work is we would like to see
50 basis points or more improvement in the entry points, either through the spread widening or curve steepening.
A lot of banks, to your point, buying in on the 25 basis points of steepening or even before that. But credit spreads
have tightened 10 basis points or more over that time, so that the net entry point improvement to us is not that
compelling.
In fact, by our math, if you bought in the third quarter, even in the first couple months of the fourth quarter, you
lost $2 in value for every $1 in carry you picked up over that period of time. So, you still have more risk should the
curve steepen further, and we don't want to be stuck in a bad trade chasing balances at what are still historically
low levels of rates. So, the good news for us is, we are very well-positioned in the investment portfolio. We have
the luxury of time. Portfolio of cash flows are about $1 billion a quarter is how we're modeling it. So, we just think
being patient – we can afford to be patient, and we'll move when we think we're getting the appropriate risk return
in the environment.

Hi. Good morning. My first question is a clarification question. Jamie, you mentioned $1 billion in buyback

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A

Yes. $180 million in the first quarter, and then any additional repurchases are certainly subject to the Fed allowing
us to do so.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
So if they lift the income restriction, I guess, number one, what are your plans for DFAST participation this
summer? And number two, where could that capacity grow to if you were not subject to that income restriction
after first quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
So, the – I'll take the second part of the question first, because that's the easier one. Right now, against our target
of 9.5%, we have a $1.2 billion of excess capital. So, until the economy shows significant improvement, $1.2
billion would take us down to our target. So, I think that's a fair number to use. The income test would deliver a
little bit less that.
In terms of the CCAR opt-in, it's funny because we've discussed this as a team and we officially have until April 5
to decide. But right now, given that our binding capital constraint is our own internal target of 9.5% versus the
Fed's prior stress capital buffer for us at 7%, or even 7.2% in their COVID test, should they adopt those December
results in the SCB. Frankly, we feel like our team deserves a rest at following the six stress tests we did during the
pandemic, and there's essentially nothing to be gained by participating, so I think for now, if I had to decide today,
I would decide not to opt in.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just my second question is on the net charge-off outlook for this cycle. Should we think that 45 basis
points to 55 basis points as your quantification of the peak or are you expecting the spike to be delayed in 2022 –
I'm just trying to square that with a 2.65% reserve ex-PPP.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Yeah. So, it's interesting when you look at the guide for us, the 45 basis points to 55 basis points for the
first quarter, we actually expect charge-offs to be in the 40-basis-point to 45-basis-point range and grow during
the year. And to your point, losses get pushed out, but we certainly expect the 45 basis points to 55 basis points
range to be the peak, even though some of the additional stimulus are elongating the cycle. I think ultimately, the
peak of the cycle keeps coming down, which is why we continue to guide to a better and better numbers. So, right
now, I think 45 basis points to 55 basis points will be the peak for us.

Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
John, this is Greg. Good question. We get it often, as you might imagine. First off, we haven't changed our
position. We're really focused on non-bank M&A opportunities as evidenced by our recent acquisition of H2C that
really supports our not-for-profit health care, part of our vertical. So, it's really about making sure that we are
additive to both our products and our service capabilities for our fee-based business whether it be wealth and
asset management, our payments capability, our capital markets capability. That's where we're spending our
energies right now, and in really getting out of businesses that are more hobby such as we talked about our
property and casualty business that wasn't really providing returns we're looking for and we couldn't get the scale.
So, our focus is going to continue to be on those opportunities to enhance our business value proposition and
grow those fee businesses. That's what we've been focused on the last five years mainly.
From a bank M&A perspective, it's not on our agenda right now. As always, we would assess an attractive
situation. But today, that's not our focus. Our focus is on non-bank M&A that adds to the businesses we just
discussed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Thanks, Greg. And then on that front, on the non-bank front, I know you mentioned wealth and asset
management. Just to confirm, is that – is it both areas that you'd be interested in? I know you've expressed an
interest in wealth, but you would also be interested in the institutional asset management side as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
No. Not the institutional side. We're pretty much focused on, like I said, the wealth and asset management side
where we made acquisitions like Franklin Street Partners in North Carolina. That's pretty much our focus right
now, on the wealth side of business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And if I can ask just one more question, in terms of the securities portfolio, just wanted
to get an update on how the underlying credit within the securities book is holding up? I know you have a CRE
concentration there in terms of CMBS, but just wanted to get an updated – an update there on what you're seeing
in terms of the performance of the underlying securities, if there's any stress there evolving. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. We're invested in about $3.5 billion of non-agency CMBS, and it's holding up well. The delinquency rates
are mid to high single-digits, but the credit enhancement right now is approaching 40%. And we only invest in the
super senior AAA-rated tranches, so that we're at the top of the repayment stack. So, we're not concerned about
the credit exposure in the non-agency book.

Okay. So, the question really is, on the spending – and I'm sure there's a lot of opportunities to spend money –
but from the strategic landscape, you have a lot of large banks that are opening up branches in some of your
markets. Others that are saying – branch lite digital first. Some are trying to use their credit cards in the markets
to cross-sell. Others are moving kind of middle market businesses into your area. So, as it relates to the kind of
the competitive banking wars in your markets. How do you think about that? I mean, are you seeing any impact
yet? Are you worried about that over the next five years? Is it much to do about nothing or is this a major strategic
threat and you say, hey, we need to spend more money on X, Y, and Z?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
And, Mike, let me start. This is Greg, and I'm going to throw it to Tim. This is a great question for him also. You
think about the investments we are making, we still expect to run, on an expense basis, down next year as we
continue to make the strategic investments. Our strategies – and you've heard this over and over – have not
changed in the last five years as far as how we're focused on the businesses which is digital transformation,
feeding our business organic opportunities to grow our businesses such as our fee-based businesses I just
discussed a moment ago, and you add that to the acquisitions, our fintech plays to add to our products and
capabilities to deliver through our customers our services. So we're going to continue to focus on that.
We're very competitive. The household growth that we've seen at 3%, strong growth in our Southeast markets.
We're a leader in the Chicago market. So, we like those investments. So, we're very comfortable in our ability to
compete. We think our investment structure we have in place today allows us to continue to grow our franchise
and be extremely competitive. So, we're not going to change that. We're going to continue to feed the
opportunities that we think create the greatest value for our shareholders.

Let me let Tim add a few comments from his...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. No. I mean, Mike, new competition is always something that we watch closely. And I think I would not
isolate it just to the folks who are traditional financial institutions that are building into our markets. We pay a lot of
attention to the fintech companies, particularly given that in some cases, they are arbitraging the regulatory
apparatus at the moment in a way that creates imbalanced competition.
I think the point that Greg made that, to me, is the most important one is we have, on a sustained basis, continued
to gain share, even in our highest-density markets over the course of the past three or four years on primary
banking relationships, which we view as being the best measure of market share because the decisions you
make on pricing, a deposit product or you domicile headquarter deposits or otherwise have a big impact on the
FDIC numbers that you sometimes see people use on a period-to-period basis. So, the strong household growth
we have seen across the franchise in particular and focused markets like Chicago and the Southeast, as Greg
mentioned on the consumer side of the business, and the strong core relationship growth that we continue to see
out of our middle market franchise are the things that give us confidence in our ability to continue to compete.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And I think – you say 3% household growth over what timeframe, and that's an interesting way to think about it
because what you're making for household is depressed from a below rate environment. So, the 3% household
growth over the past year or what timeframe?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. It's 3% household growth over the past year. But if you were to look at our growth in prior years, it would've
been in the 2% to 3% range quite steadily. So, we've actually seen some acceleration driven both by the build-out
in the Southeast and the growth rates for our Chicago market post-MB, that among the strongest in the franchise,
and definitely far stronger than we had seen in Chicago when we were Fifth Third on a stand-alone basis.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on Erika's comments and question. It
seems to me like your reserve ratios are just completely inconsistent with your charge-off guidance. Your NCO of
50 basis points at the midpoint, your – and at the peak of the cycle does seem to be suggesting that the
government has effectively played the role of superhero and prevented credit cycle from really even emerging.
And your reserves are about 5 times that. And I would guess your weighted average remaining life is not five
years. And that doesn't even consider that your NCO rates are going to fall from here. So, can you just help me
bridge the gap on your reserve levels relative to your charge-offs? Because the conclusion would be, it would
20

seem to me to be that you're making an ample level of qualitative adjustments or your probability weighting
downside scenarios pretty conservatively, and that we should be thinking that it's pretty likely you are going to see
pretty significant reserve releases in the coming quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. It's a very good question, and the answer really comes down to the fact that the modeling of the ACL is
based on the Moody's hypothetical scenario, and that's frankly why we included that in the prepared remarks, so
everybody would have that information. It is certainly a scenario that is one, the base scenario is more
conservative than our own outlook; and, two, does include a 20% allocation to a downside scenario, but obviously
we don't expect to happen. So by its very nature, delivers an ACL reserve that would be higher than our
expectation for losses in this environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Well, the reserve calculation is, for us, a three-year reasonable and supportable period, and then it reverts back
over the remaining years to your historical loss rates, whereas our guide is our internal modeling over the next 12
months. So you can have differences in that, given the different scenarios that are used.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Right. Yeah. I don't want to belabor this, but like if you're saying that this is the peak and your reserves are 5
times that, it just seems hard to disconnect the two to that degree. It's just seems like there is a...

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A

come down and should come down.

James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Our point is, we remain conservatively positioned and prudently positioned, given the uncertainty in the
environment. And we'd like to get through another three to six months and see how this...

Saul Martinez Q

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
I think that's really important what...

Yeah. I mean once – yeah, right.

Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
That's really important what Jamie has said.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
It's a good problem to have. So go ahead, sorry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. No. This is a conversation that's, this is Greg – this is a conversation which obviously that's on the forefront
of how we think about our business. But we are taking a conservative approach. We do want to wait and see over
the next couple quarters how those vaccines play out, how the economy plays out. I mean, you're exactly right. If
you look at what we've got modeled versus what our expectations are, we think there's significant upside for
reserve releases as we go into the latter part of this year if things play out as we expect they would.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Just as a quick follow – additional question on expenses, just to make sure I'm getting the glide path right
here. Based on your full year and your first quarter expenses, it would seem like, at the midpoint of the range,
you're factoring at about $1.1 billion a quarter of expenses from 2Q to 4Q. And I guess you get there in 2Q with –
most of the way there with the seasonal expenses going away. But, I mean, is it fair to say, like, how do we think
about that glide path? And should we be thinking that by fourth quarter, with some of these expense initiatives
filtered through, you could be even below that $1.1 billion run rate as you head into 2022?

James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. It's a good observation. We do have a higher run rate in the first quarter due to the seasonal items that we
typically have and that I discussed...

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
...in the prepared remarks. And, yes, when you model it out, $1.1 billion is a fairly good run rate to assume, given
the revenue projections, if fee growth ends up being better than the 3% to 4% and expenses, obviously, revenue
lines...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
...will be higher. But for our outlook, you are exactly right. And then the benefit that we might have in the fourth
quarter is to the extent our lean process automation and other initiatives pay off sooner than the 2022 time
horizon, then you could see some additional improvement in the fourth quarter. But for now, we're expecting...

Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A

...$100 million to $150 million of savings to occur in 2022 and not in 2021.

Morning.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Hey, Gerard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Coming back to loan loss reserves, when you take a look at your loan loss reserve on January 1 when the CECL
was put into place for you and your peers, I think your loan loss reserve was about 180 basis points.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
182 basis points. Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
There you go. Clearly, it's higher today. Do you think ultimately – I don't know if it's 2022 or 2023 – but is that a
good endpoint that we should look at in terms of when this whole COVID issue is behind us?
And as the second part of this whole loan loss reserving, what's your guys' view on CECL now that we've had it
for a year, I know it was a very tumultuous year, but do you think it's made it more volatile, less volatile?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
I'll take the first question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
You don't have to answer the two.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
In terms of the 182 basis points and the day one level, we've spent a lot of time looking at that as to when should
we or if we ever should return back to that day one, 182 basis points. And right now, our current thinking is that in

order to get there, it's going to measured a lot longer than several quarters because we're going to exit this crisis
with corporate debt levels, leverage levels, significantly higher coming out than they were going in. And the way
the modeling works, you would have to have an economic outlook as good as the outlook was essentially in 4Q of
2019. And that might be hard to ever get back to, at least in the next couple of years.
So I think the bias for all of our reserves across the industry is probably to take a longer period of time. And
ultimately you said, take a guess as to where that plays out over the next two years. Or at the end of two years
from now, would you be at your day one? I would say we probably are over that number because of the corporate
debt levels and because the economic outlook is probably not as favorable as the 4Q 2019 outlook was when we
adopted CECL.

In terms of...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yes. Volatility, absolutely yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
I mean, obviously, given the CECL methodology and going into a stress environment, you saw those huge, huge
swings that we're dealing with right now. Then also, it just was necessary to release the reserves. The models
haven't been tuned for this. No one modeled in a pandemic. These are new models, so there's a lot of qualitative
adjustments to these models that bears burdens to the uncertainty in front of us right now. So it does definitely
make it more volatile for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
No doubt. Greg, here is a bigger picture question for you. When you go down the elevator in the evening, the
outlook for the banking industry, including Fifth Third, is positioned very well, assuming this economy recovers, as
we all think it will. Those bank stock prices as you know from your own stock price since the Pfizer announcement
right after the election has been fantastic. What do you see as – everything is hopefully going to shape up really
well this year. But what are the risks that you worry about when you go down that elevator at night?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
First off, good question. I think we're well-positioned to be competitive in the markets that we're in. The
investments that we've made I think are in line with our long-term growth expectations and success of our
business. So, I feel really good about how we're competing today. The challenge always is, is when we're
watching these fintech players come forth, not seeing the same regulatory oversight that we're dealing with,
capital expectation and so forth. So there's a threat there that we're kind of watching. If they get access to the
banking system, payment rails and so forth, that can create some stress for us that I'm very concerned about.
But as far as our investments in fintech entities themselves and investments that we're making, I'm comfortable
with. It's really those fintech players out there that are under the same regulatory framework that we are creating
some stress for us, nipping around the edge of our profit pools, and maybe shifting some customer behavior.
So, that's probably the thing that keeps me up most at the night. As far as competing against other banks, I think
we've done all the right things to do that. Just making sure we keep our eyes open, and we have been on what it
looks like we're competing with some of these other nontraditional bank players. To that end, that's why we've
made significant investments in our digital capabilities and really create a digital bank ourselves. All of our lending
products are online available, depository products online, service capabilities. And we've made huge investments
in our digital capabilities to make sure we're well-positioned to deal with those type of threats.

open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Greg, just leveraging off of your last answer to Gerard, do you see fintech acquisitions as a necessary
item in the future or do you just want to be a good customer of these companies?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
I think, once again, we've been either a partner or acquirer of fintech opportunities. Once again, it gets back into
our strategy whether – it's buy, partner, then build. So, we really want to focus on the technology and the
capabilities that are already out there, and it fits into our strategic direction with respect to how we're going to offer
it. And with the opportunity it looks like, from a growth perspective, we'd like to buy that capability if it's already
there. It's quicker way to get for the market. If we can't do that, you've watched us do numerous fintech
partnerships to allow us to get the capabilities through that type of relationship. And if we can't do that, you've
watch us build, and build those capabilities. That's really been our mindset over the last decade with respect to
how we handle fintechs or how we address those opportunities.
