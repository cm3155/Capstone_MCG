MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Mark Edward Tucker
Non-Executive Group Chairman, HSBC Holdings Plc
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us this morning. Before we get into the details of
the presentation that Noel and Ewen will make, I wanted to just set aside a few minutes just to give you some
context.
During the course of the last year, the board determined that it had two major priorities. One was to ensure that a
new group Chief Executive was selected and the other was the need to enhance performance, accelerate pace,
and improve our sustainable returns. Collectively, we concluded that both were urgent challenges and that we
needed to tackle them immediately and separately. We have always seen that these have needed to be parallel
processes with independent timescales and the board, I, can promise you, have been fully engaged in both.
Let me deal first with the group CEO selection process. The board has embarked on a very thorough and rigorous
process to search for and identify a new CEO. That process is well underway and it's the board's intention to
announce the outcome within the 6 to 12-month timescale that we outlined in August.
Turning now to the business update, we saw a pressing need to reallocate capital away from underperforming
businesses to support the growth of higher return businesses, particularly where we have competitive advantage.
The board and executive are also acutely aware of the need to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and inject pace.

And we have been working hard on this and it is to Noel's credit that he has graphed the issues and tackled the
task with energy and resolve. He and the rest of the executive team have worked very closely with the board to
formulate and determine the plans that they have announced today. And as you've seen, they amount to a very
significant shift in the allocation of the bank's capital and resources. They build on a natural and inherent
strengths of the organization, and are designed to significantly improve sustainable return for our shareholders.
And then finally and is I think just worth mentioning – important to mention and to recognize the continuing
exceptional work of our team, of our staff across the world, particularly those in mainland China and Hong Kong
who are dealing with the impacts of COVID-19 on both our customers and the bank. The board and I want to
make it clear that we owe them enormous gratitude and thanks for their continuing dedication, their care and their
immense professionalism.
Having said all of that let me now pass over to Noel and Ewen to take you through the details.

Noel Quinn
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Mark, and good morning to everyone in London and good afternoon to everyone listening or watching
in Hong Kong. We have two objectives today. The first is to take you through our Q4 and full year results for 2019
and the second is to tell you how we're going to address the underperforming parts of the business and simplify
the group to increase returns, reduce our cost base and create capacity to invest in growth and technology.
We're going to do this in three parts: first,, Ewen will take you through the numbers for 2019. I'll then talk about
our plan, and then back to Ewen to cover the financial implications of that plan and then we'll take questions.
So, I'll now pass straight over Ewen for him to talk about our results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Noel, and good morning or afternoon, all. On the fourth quarter, it was a decent set of results. Adjusted
revenues were up 3% reflecting both a weaker quarter in 2019 but also the continuing strength of our stronger
performing franchises. While adjusted profits were up 29% due to the goodwill impairment of $7.3 billion, we
made a reported loss before tax of $3.9 billion.
As I go on to shortly, Hong Kong continues to produce very resilient results in the fourth quarter with adjusted
profits up 3% relative to a year before, but given the continuing impact of coronavirus that we're seeing this year,
we do expect a weaker first half. A few particular points to call out, the headline results for the fourth quarter were
impacted at a headline basis because of the large goodwill impairment, this reflected the weakened interest rate
outlook and revenue outlook and a changed long-term growth rate assumptions.
As you know, the goodwill impairment has no impact on core tier 1. The UK ring-fenced bank was [audio gap]
(00:04:59) redress costs $224 million in the fourth quarter driven mainly by sharply higher expected litigation costs
in relation to PPI. We're making progress on reducing our cost run rate down by half from 5.6% to just under 3%
in 2019. And second half costs were lower than first half costs. Our core tier 1 was up 40 basis points to 14.7%.
We've reduced net risk-weighted assets in the quarter by $22 billion, including a $19-billion reduction in Global
Banking and Markets.

On slide 4, group continues to be underpinned by a strong set of franchises, all showing continued attractive
growth rates. In Retail Banking and Wealth Management, full year adjusted revenues were up 9% with good
growth in deposits, mortgage balances and customer numbers. The turnaround of Global Private Banking
continues with net new money of $23 billion in the year. Commercial Banking revenues were up 6% underpinned
by strong growth in both lending and deposits.
And for our global transaction banking franchise revenues were up 3%. And that's despite the impact of a softer
interest rate environment. In Asia, revenues up 7% overall with good growth across most of the region, and the
UK ring-fenced bank had revenue growth of 3% underpinned by deposit balance and mortgage growth.
Turning to the next slide and to go into more detail on Hong Kong, macro conditions progressively became more
challenging in the second half and remain challenging given the sharp and unfolding impact of the coronavirus.
Despite these macro conditions last year, 2019 performance remained resilient. Adjusted revenue growth was 7,
credit quality remaining robust, and profits before tax of $12.1 billion.
On slide 6, if we set over recent quarters, we've also got businesses or parts of businesses that need to improve.
Our non-ring-fenced bank is impacted by a combination of high costs and challenging conditions for the sector
overall. Revenues were down 3% in the full year. And as part of those, Global Banking and Markets had a weak
year in Europe with sharply lower revenues driving an 80% reduction in pre-tax profits.
Our US turnaround has been impacted by the changed US outlook for interest rates. Full year revenues were
down 3%, and profits before tax down 39%. Our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and Private Banking
businesses in the US were loss making in the year and profits in Commercial Banking and Global Banking and
Markets both fell by more than 20%.
Turning to the detail of the full year results on slide 7, across most segments in our global businesses, we saw a
strong revenue growth in 2019. Total adjusted revenues up 6%. In Retail Banking and Wealth Management,
revenues up 9%, including 7% in Retail Banking due mainly to lending and deposit growth in Hong Kong, Latin
America and in the UK and up 13% in Wealth Management principally from higher life insurance revenue
including positive market impacts.
In Commercial Banking, revenues up 6% with Global Liquidity and Cash Management up 6% and Credit and
Lending up 5%. Trade finance had slower revenue growth in 2018 impacted by the ongoing US-China trade
dispute.
Within Global Banking and Markets, while revenues were down 1% overall, transaction banking showed good
revenue growth, up 2%, but Global Markets had a tougher year with revenues declining by 8%. And within Global
Private Banking, revenues were up 5% underpinned by our best net new money performance since 2008.
On slide 8, fourth quarter revenues were up 9% overall or almost $1.2 billion, that's despite $300 million of lower
Corporate Centre revenues. This quarter included a much stronger franchise by the Wealth Management
franchise given the turnaround from weak markets in the fourth quarter of the previous year and our best fourth
quarter revenue performance in Global Banking and Markets for four years. In Commercial Banking and Retail
Banking, we can begin to see the impact of lower policy rates with further headwinds expected in 2020.
On the next slide, adjusted net interesting income was broadly stable from the third quarter and the net interest
margin was unchanged at 156 basis points, helped by lower provisions from UK redress programs and releases
relating to Argentinian hyperinflation.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 18-Feb-2020
Our Asian franchise experienced some asset margin compression with the net interest margin down 5 basis
points. And in the UK ring-fenced bank, while the headline net interest margin was up 2 basis points, excluding
lower UK redress provisions, the underlying net interest margin was broadly stable at around 200 basis points.
Turning to costs, excluding the UK bank levy, adjusted operating costs were up 2.7% in the fourth quarter relative
to the fourth quarter of 2018. Our cost run rate this year was down by half and slightly better in the second half
than the first, and that's despite higher investment spend, up 10%, from the previous year. For your models in
2020, you should assume that our aim is to have adjusted operating costs broadly stable on 2019 and adjusted
revenues down very modestly with RWA disposal costs taken to significant items.
Turning to the next slide on credit, credit costs were down 5 basis points to 28 basis points in the fourth quarter.
This reflected a number of items in the UK. We reduced our allowances for economic uncertainty by $99 million to
$311 million. Against this, in Hong Kong, we increased our overlay by $56 million to $138 million and we took
incremental provisions in Argentina of some $125 million. Second half credit costs were 31 basis points. So, we're
now at the low end of our expected 30 to 40 basis points of through the cycle range.
Given the impact of the coronavirus, we expect a continuing downturn in Hong Kong in the first half of this year,
and we anticipate that we'll need to take additional expected credit losses into our first quarter results. I would
caution, however, the impact of the virus could vary materially, in part dependent on the time taken to contain the
virus, with additional expected credit losses only part of a broader potential set of financial impacts on the group,
including lower revenues and volumes, and credit rating deterioration driving higher risk-weighted assets.
On capital adequacy, our core tier 1 ratio improved 40 basis points in the quarter to 14.7%. This reflected a
material reduction in RWAs in the fourth quarter that I'll go into detail on the next slide. We set out the detail of the
risk-weighted assets here of – and return on tangible equity walks during 2019 for risk-weighted assets. We've
reduced these by almost $22 billion during the year with the bulk of this coming in the fourth quarter. We took a
very conscious decision to accelerate our risk-weighted asset plans in Global Banking and Markets resulting in a
$19 billion reduction in that business in the final quarter.
Looking forward, we're sensitive to a number of potential headwinds and risks including a forecast first quarter
2020 RWA uplift of around $10 billion due to modeling and regulatory changes and a similar amount from revenue
growth.
For our return on tangible equity, it declined by 20 basis points during the year to 8.4%. This reflected a stable
overall performance but was impacted by a 50-basis point negative impact from intangible movements primarily
due to present value in-force movements in our insurance business.
So to summarize on the 2019 financial performance before handing back to Noel, for the full year, adjusted
revenues up 6%, adjusted profits up 5%, in part reflecting much better cost discipline with positive jaws of over
3% and a return on tangible equity of 8.4%.
Our core tier 1 was up 70 basis points in the year to 14.7%, in part due to a significant RWA reduction in Global
Banking and Markets. However, despite this continuing progress last year, we've recognized the need to continue
to drive up group returns to significantly improve areas of the group with low returns currently. This requires a new
cost and RWA reduction plan that Noel will now step through.

Noel Quinn
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Ewen. I'll talk about our plans to increase returns in a second. But first, I want to say a few words about
the coronavirus outbreak. This is clearly something we're observing closely and I'd like to pay tribute to the
resilience that our people have shown during this very difficult time and to thank them for their amazing
commitment. Our first priority is obviously the well-being of our people and our customers. And we will continue to
do all that we can to provide support and ensure their safety.
There will inevitably be a short-term economic impact that will doubtless affect our clients and we will do all that
we can to support them. However, the long-term strategic importance and attractiveness of mainland China, Hong
Kong, and the broader Asian region remains unchanged. And the region as a whole remains a key part of our
strategy.
Turning to our plan, we intend to deliver on three action programs between now and 2022. We will implement an
RWA upgrade program, stripping out low-returning RWAs from the underperforming parts of our business, and
redeploying them into higher-returning areas. We will execute a $4.5 billion cost reduction program to reduce total
costs, even as we invest in the business. And we will simplify HSBC to increase revenue synergies and
accelerate the pace of execution.
We will target the following in 2022: a gross RWA reduction of more than $100 billion, a reduced cost base of $31
billion or lower, and a CET1 ratio in the range of 14% to 15%. Taken together, these should help us achieve our
main target of a return on tangible equity of 10% to 12% by 2022, with a full-year benefit of cost reductions and
redeployed RWAs flowing into subsequent years.
To be clear, I do not consider 12% to be a ceiling for the group, I think we can go higher and we will aspire to do
so. This is a deep and fundamental restructuring of the bank that will enable us to deliver on our strategy and our
potential. Crucially, it's not dependent on market conditions. It's focused on things that we can control.
Our first task is to upgrade the return profile of RWAs. We plan to remove more than $100 billion of low-returning
RWAs and reinvest them in high growth, high returning activities in other parts of the business. As you know, we
have a very strong heritage with a wholesale and personal client base centered around the faster growing, higher
returning markets of the world; a differentiated proposition serving the banking needs of middle market
entrepreneurial businesses globally; a personal banking franchise grounded in three scale and attractive markets,
in Hong Kong, the UK and Mexico; and a strong international wealth business with circa $1.4 trillion of client
assets.
That core franchise delivers strong inherent RoTE and sustainable growth potential. These are the parts of the
business that we want to continue to grow. However, as I mentioned at our Q3 results, we have parts of the
organization, our US business and the non-ring-fenced bank in the UK and Continental Europe that are not
producing acceptable returns, particularly in Global Banking and Markets. These are the businesses we intend to
reshape.
Let's start with Europe. We want to focus our footprint in Europe on our international wholesale and transaction
banking franchises, and connect our clients better to our international network, particularly Asia and the Middle
East. By 2022, we intend to reduce the net RWAs in the non-ring-fenced bank by around 35% and, within that, to
reduce Global Banking and Markets RWAs by around 50%.

We also intend to reduce our non-ring-fenced bank costs by around 25%. We plan to do this by focusing our client
coverage on clients that value our international network and presence, particularly in Asia and the Middle East,
rather than serving pure domestic clients. We will scale back the amount of capital we deploy to our Rates
business and exit capital and leverage-intensive product lines such as G10 long-term derivative market making in
the UK.
We will focus our European investment banking activities on supporting UK mid-market corporates and capital
flows and transactions between Europe and the faster-growing markets of the world. London will remain an
investment banking hub to support our global clients.
We will reduce our equity sales and equity research activities in Europe to match our client footprint and we will
transition our structured product capabilities from the UK to Asia where the opportunity for profitable growth is
greater. And we'll continue to reinvest in our transaction banking and financing capabilities.
We've recognized the need to take action to address our retail banking operations in France and a strategic
review is ongoing. We will provide an update on that review when it is appropriate to do so. But we have not
assumed any change to our current business model in the forecast shared with you today.
Turning to the US, we are one of the leading wholesale and transaction banking franchises and the leading trade
bank in the world, so we need a meaningful presence in the US. But we need a new approach that generates
acceptable returns. As in Europe, we're going to focus on our strengths. We'll reposition HSBC USA as an
international client-focused corporate bank, anchored in Commercial Banking and Global Banking, with a focused
retail offering for international and affluent clients. This will be a fundamentally different business to today's. We
will consolidate select fixed income activity in London and reduce US Global Markets RWAs by around 45%. We
will reinvest the majority of the RWAs saved into Commercial Banking and Retail Banking. In Commercial
Banking, we'll expand our coverage of midmarket corporates who trade in the US and internationally. And in
Retail Banking, we will expand our product offering and increase our investment in digital.
We'll refocus our Retail Banking presence to serve globally mobile clients, reducing our branch network in the US
by around 30%. We considered a number of options with respect to US Retail Banking, including exiting it
completely. But our retail deposit base in the US provides an important source of stable liquidity for our Wholesale
Banking and global transaction banking activities. And we believe we can connect our Personal Banking
operations in the US to our Personal Banking operations in the rest of the world, just as we have in Wholesale
Banking.
Finally, and partly as a consequence of these changes, we'll embark upon a major cost and consolidation
program in the US that should reduce our total costs by between 10% and 15%. The big difference between this
and previous US turnaround plans, is that all of these changes are within our control. We are not reliant on
favorable market conditions and we have a new management team that is totally focused on delivering these
plans. The outcome should be a leaner more focused business delivering higher sustainable returns.
Moving on to Global Banking and Markets, it is worth taking a step back and considering the type of business that
we want Global Banking and Markets to be. We want to continue to serve large long-term capital providers, public
sector entities and global corporate and financial institutions, who can use our international network, particularly in
the faster-growing markets.
We want to do this as the top transaction bank and a leading global finance in-house and to reinforce our position
as the foremost international bank in Asia and the Middle East. To deliver this, we will invest in Asia and the

Middle East to cement our position as a top three corporate and investment bank across both Global Banking and
Commercial Banking clients.
We will continue to invest in our global transaction banking franchise to defend our market leadership and deliver
sustainable growth. We will strengthen our investment banking capabilities in Asia and in the Middle East, while
maintaining a global investment banking hub in London. And we will build leading emerging markets and financing
capabilities in Global Markets, and enhance our institutional clients business. We will also improve collaboration
with other businesses.
Currently, Global Banking and Markets and Commercial Banking both own their own products and operations
capabilities. They cross-sell fairly successfully today, but we want to offer our clients a much more integrated
service. To drive revenue synergies, we will reorganize our product teams to serve both frontline businesses. And
to drive cost synergies, we'll combine the operational support infrastructure for Global Banking and Commercial
Banking. We will also continue to invest in the digital systems and solutions that will improve the service we offer
our clients.
So, here is where we intend to reinvest the RWAs that we save. Even in the current environment, we see
significant opportunities for growth. Our transaction banking businesses are a major revenue driver for the group
and will continue to do so. We have an excellent opportunity to build our international wealth franchise,
particularly in Asia and among the international Asian community. Asia as a whole is a core engine of growth for
the business over the next few years. We will continue to invest in the expansion of our business in China
generally, the Greater Bay Area in particular, and across Southeast Asia.
Given our heritage in the Middle East and the many market reforms that are taking place, we are in a strong
position to take advantage of the significant opportunities that will arise. We also intend to continue capturing
market share in the UK ring-fenced bank as we have in recent quarters, and we see strong growth momentum in
our business in Mexico. We will also be investing more in technology, improving our digital platforms to expand
our reach and improve customer experience.
Turning to cost reduction and simplification. There are three paths to a reduced cost base and a simpler business.
First, we will take out costs associated with the activities we choose to exit. Second, we'll keep investing in
technology to reengineer manual or legacy processes, removing costs and improving the customer experience.
Third, we will organize ourselves in a less matrixed and fragmented fashion, leading to lower cost, increased
accountability and greater agility. The net effects of these changes will be a simpler more streamlined business.
We expect savings of $4.5 billion from this cost program which will allow us to substantially reduce our cash run
rate. Our intention is to target total adjusted costs of no more than $31 billion in 2022.
Many of the changes we're going to make will have a material impact on the cost and complexity involved in
running the group. First, we will combine Retail Banking and Wealth Management and Global Private Banking to
create one new global business which we will call Wealth and Personal Banking. Not only will this increase our
ability to find revenue synergies within a much larger wealth business, it means we can remove many layers and
support structures associated with running two global businesses.
Second, and as I already mentioned, we will merge the back and middle offices for our Wholesale Banking
businesses. This will help us sell more products to more clients, but it will also reduce duplication and increase
collaboration.

Third, we are simplifying the way we manage our geographies, where previously we had seven geographies, we
will now have four covering Asia, the UK, the US and the rest of the world. Each of these will be represented on
the Group Executive Committee which will be smaller than before. This will increase accountability, reduce
complexity and improve our ability to execute at pace.
Fourth, we will be able to reorganize our global functions to match the size and simplified structure of our frontline
teams. And finally, we as an executive committee will be increasingly incentivized via our score cards to deliver
the right outcome for the bank as a whole, not just for our individual business units or functions.
This represents one of the deepest restructuring and simplification programs in our history. It will help us not only
to reduce our cost base, but also to become a more collaborative, empowered, customer-centric business, while
maintaining or enhancing our risk framework. Taken together, these actions will significantly change the shape of
the group.
The new Wealth and Personal Banking business and Commercial Banking will occupy a greater share of RWAs
for the group. While the share of Global Banking and Markets will reduce from 31% to less than 25%. On a
geographical basis, Asia and the UK ring-fenced bank will be the main beneficiaries from the reduction in RWAs,
currently allocated to the non-ring-fenced bank and the US.
So, in summary, since Q3, we have developed a detailed restructuring plan to address the low-return portfolios of
Europe and the US, and to reshape Global Banking and Markets. We have plans to reallocate freed-up capital
into higher-growth, higher-return businesses and markets. We have begun an ambitious simplification and cost
reduction program while increasing IT investment. This is a robust plan built around things we can control,
predicated on reasonable revenue growth assumptions, combined with significant cost reduction, and capital
efficiency programs.
We have reorganized our management structure to deliver a pace. We have established a dedicated
transformation team to focus on executing the restructuring, with a separate team focused on building future
growth strategies. And since my appointment in August, we have taken tough decisions to deliver quick results.
In the fourth quarter, we reduced RWAs by $22 billion, we reversed the direction of travel on both cost and head
count, and we refreshed the executive management team to position us for execution. Now, we need to evidence
continued delivery, and I am totally committed to doing that.
Back to you, Ewen.

Thanks, Noel. To take you through the broad financial implications of what Noel's just outlined, we expect to have
risk-weighted assets in 2022 that are broadly in line with year-end 2019, with reductions in the non-ring-fenced
bank, the US, and parts of Global Banking and Markets, increasing our capacity to invest in both planned growth
and priority markets and to deal with the expected impact of regulatory changes.
Over the same three-year period, we're also planning a material reduction in the leverage exposure of global
markets. We're targeting an annual cost base of $31 billion or less in 2022, which translates into a return
intangible equity in that year of 10% to 12%, and we want to do those while maintaining our core tier 1 ratio in the
range of 14% to 15%. For clarity, these targets exclude the impact of any business disposals.

On the next slide, on risk-weighted assets, we're planning to materially reduce RWAs in the non-ring-fenced bank
and to a lesser extent in the US. And as a part of this and given that almost 60% of the RWAs across those two
entities are Global Banking and Markets related, we're specifically targeting a material reduction in capital
allocation to that business. Largely offsetting this is planned growth in other franchises. The core underlying RWA
growth across the group is currently at around 4% to 5% per annum. So over a three-year period, we'll largely
offset the RWA reduction we're planning.
On Basel III reform, at this point we've become less concerned about the day one net impact. We now see a
relatively limited uplift post mitigating actions we're planning to take.
On the next slide we set out where we expect the gross RWA reduction to be achieved. The bulk of the reduction
and revenue impact we're targeting is expected to come from Global Banking and Markets and to a lesser extent
Commercial Banking. The run down program is likely to take three years to execute with a dedicated team now
set up to execute those.
The disposal losses of the RWA rundown program and Global Banking and Markets is expected to cause in the
order of $1.2 billion, and this will be taken into significant items, spread mainly over 2020 and 2021, with the
associated net revenue loss expected to be in the order of $2.5 billion. We're also targeting a gross reduction and
leverage exposure of $250 billion in the non-ring-fenced bank in the US, partially offset by around $50 billion of
anticipated growth in the Global Markets franchise in Asia.
On the next slide, we expect RWAs at the end of 2022 to be broadly in line with where they were at the end of
2019. 2020 revenues will be impacted by the impact of lower interest rates and the assumed non-repeat of certain
positive revenue items in 2019. These items include positive market impacts in and disposal gains which in total,
totaled to around $0.5 billion. We intend to reduce RWAs by over $100 billion in areas generating low revenues to
risk-weighted assets with very high cost/income ratios, and we intend to redeploy these risk-weighted assets in
areas of higher revenue and lower cost/income ratios, particularly over the medium to longer term. The reduction
and redeployment of RWAs and associated revenue impacts will be spread fairly evenly over the three years of
our plan, and we do expect further benefits from the redeployment of RWAs to flow into 2023 and beyond.
On the next slide, the targeted growth reduction in RWAs help us fund the cost of the restructuring, the underlying
growth in RWAs from our stronger performing franchises, and the anticipated net impact of Basel III reform.
However, our current group capital – group returns are insufficient to fund both the natural growth in our business
and to fully immunize this group dividend. So, in an order to bridge to 2022 when we expect to have higher
returns, we're suspending the buyback for this year and next.
We're also shifting our guidance on our core tier 1 ratio, we're still targeting to be above 14%, but signaling today
that over the next three years we expect to be at the higher end of a 14% to 15% range from 2021 onwards. Over
the medium term as we target reducing gross peak to trough stress in the group and seek to further optimize
today's capital inefficiency that comes from our subsidiary structure, we plan to reduce our core tier 1 ratio back to
the lower end of the 14% to 15% range.
Turning to costs, we plan to substantially reduce our costs run rate to $31 billion or better by 2022. Given
underlying inflation over this period and the expected reduction in the bank levy, this reflects a real reduction in
the order of 10%.
With the shift to higher yielding RWAs over the same period, we expect a material operating profit improvement

business reductions, these amount to around 45% of the total. The organization simplification, that Noel has just
outlined, including a substantial restructuring of group's central costs, this amounts to around 35% of total
savings. And for the remainder, technology investment that leads to increased levels of automation and
productivity accounting to around 20% of the total.
The cost program will require intense focus on delivery. There are almost 200 separate cost initiatives
underpinning this. Progress will be monitored through a tight central oversight team with some of those cost
initiatives starting today.
On slide 33, we expect costs to achieve to have been substantially completed by 2022 with full run rate benefits
achieved in subsequent years. Expected cost savings of $4.5 billion from this new cost program are phased
across the three years: $1 billion to be delivered in 2020, a further $2 billion in 2021, and the remainder in 2022.
We expect that additional restructuring costs in the order of $6 billion will be required with more than 90% of these
costs incurred this year and next.
So to conclude from me before handing back to Noel, we believe we're setting out an ambitious but realistic plan
to achieve a number of objectives, firstly to materially improve our overall group returns by 2022. That allows us
both to grow, how we want to grow and to fund our current distribution policy.
Secondly, to take capital and cost away from underperforming franchises, so we can continue to invest where we
have stronger returns and growth prospects. And lastly to simplify our currently overly complex structure, reducing
the overall group and central costs, and improving the capital efficiency of the group. Noel.

Thanks, Ewen. So to quickly summarize, strong revenue growth in our target areas and good cost discipline in
2019; a firm intention to grow returns, create the capacity to invest, and to build a platform for sustainable growth;
a robust plan to restructure our US and European businesses, reposition Global Banking and Markets, and
reallocate capital to higher growth businesses, all while simplifying the group; a path to a return on tangible equity
of 10% to 12% in 2022 through a gross risk-weighted asset reduction program of more than $100 billion and a
gross cost reduction of around $4.5 billion by the end of 2022. We also have a strong ambition to seek additional
strategic opportunities for growth and higher returns and a commitment to deliver.
With that, we're happy to take questions, and I think Richard will step up and...

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Hi, good morning. It's Raul Sinha from JPMorgan. Maybe two, please. One on the strategy, I guess for the plan to
work, the capital redeployment will be the key element. And I really appreciate the detail you've given us on where
you're taking capital away. But I was wondering if you could give us more detail about where you're going to put
that capital into. And apart from the areas, internal geographies and businesses, could you also talk about
whether the plan is organic or whether also you might consider inorganic options?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, I'll deal with the second one first. The plans that are before you and the forecast that are before you are all
based on organic activity, there's no inorganic assumed in those plans. Second on capital redeployment, we still
believe and have seen in 2019 strong growth in Asia, in the Middle East, in our UK business, and we want to
continue to fuel that growth and we see that growth continuing going forward.
We've also seen extremely strong growth in Mexico. Let me just recall, Mexico today, or in 2019, achieved a
return on tangible equity of 15%, and that business has extremely strong growth momentum still in it, so we want
to provide that. In terms of Asia, to be more specific, we see still growth potential in our international Commercial
Banking franchise, that proposition is well-positioned to continue to grow. I think we have a unique and
differentiated position in international mid-market.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
...it goes both ways too. Equally, there's no disposals built into these numbers, so to the extent that there's
disposals, you should factor that on top of what we're announcing today. And in terms of organic growth, I'd just
point you to look some of the underlying growth rates that we've had in places like Asia over the last decade. And
yes, there's a near term impact from the coronavirus, but we do think there's a secular growth opportunity in trade
and wealth in Asia over the next 10 to 15 years, and that we are relatively uniquely placed currently to take
advantage of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Just to give you one example of that in Asia, Commercial Banking, I remember when I took over that business at
the end of 2010, we had a balance sheet at that point of around about $80 billion. Today, that balance sheet is
closer to, I think, $135 billion, and still has potential to grow. So, we want to continue to fuel that investment.

Martin Leitgeb Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
Thank you. Yes. Good morning. Martin Leitgeb from Goldman Sachs. Could I just follow-up on the capital
comments earlier? And I was just wondering under what timeframe should we consider HSBC to return to this
kind of more normalized capital level of closer to the lower end of the 14% to 15% range rather than the 15%
range you're kind of signaling over the next three years for the restructuring period?
And the second question, more strategically, and I was just wondering HSBC UK sort of ring-fenced bank, how
strategic do you consider it within the group context, just bearing in mind obviously the limitation imposed by ring-
fencing on the utilization of retail deposits? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I'll deal with the second one first. We see it as a very strategically important part of the portfolio, it generates
inherently higher returns. If you look at the underlying returns of the UK business and the UK market, it's an
attractive market. We've seen growth in market share and growth in our own business in both Retail Banking and
Commercial Banking. And we believe it will become increasingly connected to the rest of the world, in a post-
Brexit world. So, it's strategically important.
Ewen, do you want to go to capital?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
[indiscernible] (00:47:03) to go into a bit more detail on the comments and guidance around capital. Look, in the
very near term, we're obviously sensitive to the fact that we're doing significant restructuring and the precise
timing of restructuring charges and RWA rundown over that period can vary and hence, why we want some
capital flexibility.
Secondly, the final rules on Basel reform haven't been settled. So, what you see embedded in the numbers today
is a net increase of less than 2%. So, if we go back, I think if I – presenting views about a year ago and when I
was reluctant to do so, it was because we could see that there was a path to significant mitigation.
In the medium term, we've got two big structural issues that we're working through as a bank. Firstly, we have
enormous complexity in the group, because of the subsidiary structure. Our largest single balance sheet has less
than 30% of the group assets. If you compare us to US peers, typically 70% of one balance sheet is the dominant
balance sheet in the group. As a result, we have an enormous amount of capital and efficiency across the group.
We're also subject to 64 markets where in some markets, for example, we're held to standardized rules and not
able to take advantage of advanced modeling. So, there's a progressive work plan on that over the next few
years.
And the second issue that we're dealing with is we've still got, I think, a significant level of peak-to-trough stress
across the group. Some of that is getting addressed as part of this restructuring. For example, we're planning to
substantially reduce the principal investment business that sits in the non-ring-fenced bank. One of the core
reasons for doing that is not the fact that it produces attractive returns under base, but under stress, it has
enormous stress characteristics. So, I think if we can make progress and solve those and make progress on
those two issues, I think we can comfortably reduce down to the lower end of that range. In terms of timing, that's
why I use language of medium term, because it's difficult to be precise.

Claire. Just behind Martin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Claire Kane Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Good morning. It's Claire Kane from Credit Suisse. A couple of follow-ups. Firstly, on the capital. In the event that
you're unable to redeploy all the RWAs, and I do know your plan to redeploy them in quite low risk-weighted asset
businesses in RBWM and transaction banking, and the capital ratio was to go well north of your 15% range over
the next two years. Would you consider buying back shares or would you rather that was all built up to 2022?
And what is the basis for your RoTE target? So the TNAV, clearly, if you built up a lot of surplus capital, that
would dilute returns. So should we expect that you are in the mid area of your 14% to 15% range by 2022 and all
surplus capital will be distributed at that point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, look, on the latter point first, I think we've said that we expect to be at the higher end of the range in 2022.
So embedded in that 10% to 12% RoTE target is the higher end of the 14% to 15% core tier 1 being held in that
year. The other thing I would say on returns is, we don't think 2022 is a clean year either for revenues, because
we've reinvested revenues into new customer relationships, where the revenue build up takes time. And secondly
we haven't got full run rate costs in 2022. So we do think that there is further upside on the return as you go out.
On capital, I mean, firstly I mean we have a high degree of confidence I guess in our ability to redeploy $100
billion of RWAs over the next three years. If we would have end up in a scenario where that wasn't the case,
we're not going to just sit and allow our capital ratios to accrete well in excess of what we need them to do. But it's
our current expectation that we're not doing buybacks for two years, if that was to change, because the RWA
profile and the capital position of the bank was very, very different. We would relook at it at that point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And just on the reasonableness of our growth assumptions. Even today with all of the challenges that exist
around coronavirus, we're seeing a strong pipeline of activity in our business globally, in – so, I think we're very
confident that we can deliver that growth plan. We've had deliver that or more in the past. So, we believe we have
made reasonable assumptions on the growth and that it can be delivered.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Before we go to the floor, let's start a couple from the web on the coronavirus. Firstly, do your – your Q4 [ph] ACR
(00:52:14) assumptions, do they take into account the coronavirus [indiscernible] (00:52:18) 31st of December?
And secondly, one from Jason Napier of UBS. DBS made some revenue guidance recently on the impact of
coronavirus, can you talk a little bit more about the expected impacts from that please?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 18-Feb-2020
Yeah. So, for accounting purposes, coronavirus is a post balance sheet event. So, it's not in our 2019 for the
economic guidance at that point. It will be obviously reflected in forward economic guidance as a part of Q1
reporting.
To give you some numbers embedded into our disclosures in the Annual Report and accounts today is various
adverse scenarios for Hong Kong economic performance, what's the downside, the most extreme downsides
scenario in there I would say makes an assumption that the coronavirus is still continuing in the second half of this
year.
If you look at that and that was to become the central scenario, there would be about $600 million of additional
loan losses provisions required. We don't think we're going to be in any way to like that in Q1, but it's not the only
revenue, and it's not the only P&L impact and capital impact. As I said earlier, there will be revenue impacts which
will become progressively more acute if the coronavirus was to continue beyond the next month to six weeks.
There would also be the risk of credit rating migration amongst the wholesale book in Hong Kong which would
lead to RWA inflation.
We think that the Q1 impact as we sit here today is probably range bound in the order of about $200 million to
$500 million relative to our previous planning assumptions. I think if the virus is still prevailing beyond that, it will
come back as part of Q1 reporting to give you a much [ph] fuller (00:54:23) update on what we think the impact is
at that point.
But it really is a – yeah, when we look at the modeling, it's really a call long – predominantly a call at this point on
how long does it take to contain the virus when you look across the various scenarios that we're trying to model at
the moment.
But underlying that I think when you look at the underlying credit performance of the book as Noel said, Q1 was
good – Q4 was good. And January was certainly robust. We are getting some positive offsets against this,
because HIBOR in particular continues to remain elevated relative to the previous planning assumptions as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
There's a few questions from the web from the likes of Tom Rayne, Jason Napier, and Manus Costello on, can
you talk a little bit more about the revenue loss from the RWA reductions and the time thereof, the timing of
reinvestment? Should you expect revenue losses earlier in the plan and a hockey stick towards the end? Can we
just have a little bit more detail on the $100 billion reductions and $100 billion reinvestment please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, there's – we thought we were providing a decent amount of guidance, but it appears that there's still a
few gaps. Yeah, you'll see in one of the charts that we've got in the presentation, some sort of bar charts, and
please don't get your rulers out to try and measure across. But for Global Banking and Markets, we've signaled
about a $2.5 billion reduction as a result of the RWA rundown that excludes the – that excludes the costs
associated with the rundown which we will treat as a significant item.
We do think offsetting that will be some degree of revenue improvement over the next three years. Therefore, we
think order of magnitude, Global Banking and Markets revenues will probably be down on the order of about $1
billion relative to last year's run rate by the time we get to 2022.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 18-Feb-2020
And the material impact, as you can see on the bar charts that are in the slides is in Global Banking and Markets.
For 2020, overall, we've talked about a very modest reduction in revenue impact, we've got interest rate
headwinds, we've set that out about $1.1 billion of lower interest income as a result of reduction in rates that's
been going on in 2019, and some assumed reduction in 2020. The bulk of that will hit 2020. We've got about $0.5
billion of one-offs that were in 2019 that we're not expecting a repeat off in terms of our forecasting. Offsetting that
is a decent amount of growth that we're continuing to see in our underlying business.
And I think the last part of that was the timing across the – yeah, broadly, we think the revenue reduction from the
RWA runoff and the revenue growth from the RWAs we're putting on is evenly sort of spread in terms of the
buildup and rundown over the three-year period.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
But I'd add one other point and that is one of the reasons we do in the organizational simplification and the cost
reduction program is to make sure we have some mitigation, so that we don't end up with stranded costs should
the revenue go down on the reduction program for RWAs, but there will be a time lag for the revenue coming up
elsewhere. So, I think you've got to take the two in the round. It's the revenue reduction build on the RWA
redeployment program and the cost reduction program that gives us more assurance on managing the situation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
More from the floor.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Guy Stebbings Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Morning. It's Guy Stebbings from Exane BNP Paribas. Can I come back, firstly, to capital being created from the
plan? If we think about the $100 billion of gross takeout that you're guiding to, but in the plan no buybacks before
2022. So, you've only got the ordinary dividend, which most people would have had in their numbers. I mean
should we be inferring that the plan itself doesn't release any capital if you do redeploy? But incremental to that,
it's really about any business proposals which creates that additional capacity. Is that the right way to be thinking
about to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I'm just going to think about that for a second. So, the $100 billion of RWA reduction would release $14 billion to
$15 billion of capital for us, offset by the after tax cost of the restructuring cost and the RWA rundown cost. So
that still creates capital in that program, but it's all embedded in the statements around the suspension of the
buyback for two years.
The second – yeah, the second part of the question is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Guy Stebbings Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Well, it's just, if we're looking a capital ratio in 2022 broadly aligned where we are today, we're saying no
buybacks before 2022, implicitly that assumes that there's no net capital release versus our previous guidance.
But you're obviously not including within that any disposals, which seems like it could be the big delta.

Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, if those disposals create value, I mean, obviously, it depends on the realization process – proceeds of
those disposals. So, possibly, but I don't – I mean, if you think about some of the stuff that's been [ph] speculated
about (01:00:07) in the press, just remember that we have a lot of net worth markets that are relatively small.
If we were to dispose of any of them, I don't think it's going to have a material impact on our capital base overall.
So, yeah, the big drivers is things like interest rates, the speed of the RWA rundown, the speed of the
redeployment, yeah all of that is going to have a far greater impact on the capital position of the bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Guy Stebbings Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Can I just come back to the capital target quickly and the peak-to-trough stresses that you referenced. But if we
look at the Bank of England stress test, and we look at the other component parts of the capital stack, consider
some trapped capital, it still feels like quite a conservative target. So, is this very much an internal stress that
you're applying, which is...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
It's certainly not driven by what the regulators think. We will always drive our capital targets by the [ph] horror of
(01:01:00) regulatory constraints and what we think. We have a more conservative view than the PRA, and where
our capital position should be.
I think – look an offset to that is, we are the best rated of the UK banks as you know with our credit ratings, we get
wholesale funding cost, therefore, that are substantially cheaper than our competitors. We've always wanted to
position ourselves as a very strongly rated, strong balance sheet bank. We get the benefit of that through funding
costs. But it's certainly not driven by any conversation we've been having with the PRA.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Guy Stebbings Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
So, we can't lean on new banking and disclosure on stress testing this year as a guide. It's more about...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
No. No. No. The stress testing issue is our own internal issue. It's something that we've recently strengthened our
stress testing team under new leadership, and we do think that we can make material progress over the next few
years on reducing the peak-to-trough delta that we're seeing in our stress test results.

I'm referring to. Kind of what assumptions are embedded in your severance costs over the next – over the time of

the restructuring? But also if you could give us the direction of where the investments go and also the sense of a
flex in that cost base. So we've got the $31 billion at the end of 2022, should the revenue surprise on the upside
or the downside? How will that number flex to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
If you can tell me how the revenues will flex, I'll tell you how the costs flex. I mean, clearly, we've positioned the
cost base to be in the context of the revenue growth opportunity. At the moment, based on the current
assumptions, we believe $31 billion or less is an appropriate position. Should the economy and the growth be
better, we'll invest in the business. Should it be different, we'll take a different course of action.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And you can see on slide 32, there was a light-gray bar there that has a significant component of investment and
growth. But broadly, we expect costs to be flat, down, down in the next three years. And getting down to $31
billion by the time you take the underlying inflation rate in the bank, at the moment, it's about 2.5% per annum. We
are expecting $700 million; that order of magnitude reduction in the bank levy from 2022 onwards. If you back
those two out, I mean, what's embedded in the plan is about a 10% reduction in real terms. But importantly,
there's a significant component in there for growth investment. If we don't see the growth coming, we'll just scale
back that growth investment.

Severance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, the detailed assumption is based on where people are leaving and what the cost of them leaving, which vary
substantially across the world. So, severance costs in Continental Europe as you know are substantially higher
than they are in other parts of the world, but all of that is reflected into the numbers and we've provided
breakdown on one of the slides of what breakdown of the cost to achieve that with about [ph] 40% (01:04:35) of
that I think is severance related.

But I think the other important thing to remember on some of the job cut numbers that have been stated today, we
currently have attrition of 25,000 people a year. So, in the context of the 35,000 job number over three years, we
anticipate about 75,000 people leaving the bank naturally over the next three years. And if we can be smart on
recruitment against that, we can materially reduce head count over a three-year period without having to pay any
severance cost against that.

Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Good morning, guys. It's Aman Rakkar from Barclays. I'm just going to come back to capital and run the risk of
asking too detailed question. It's just to interrogate the kind of cautiousness that the message that's coming
across regarding capital. I mean, basically when I do some pretty crude back-of-the-envelope math, it does look
like you are going to accrete pretty significant capital over the planned period even if you do redeploy the $100
billion of RWAs.
I mean, basically if profits are broadly maintained to the current level, you're going to pay away basically half of
that in the dividend post the scrip. And if I times that by 3, obviously, we got to take out the restructuring charge. It
does basically like you're going to build about 150 basis points to 160 basis points of capital from where you are
now, so well above 16%. I mean, first of all, is there anything there that you disagree with? And, secondly, does
that mean that there's some kind of intangible asset build or some CET1 deduction that we should be mindful of
over the planned period?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. It's hard to have the debate in the absence of numbers, but it feels a little bit high. I mean maybe if you can
sort of step through your model with [ph] IR (01:06:36) afterwards we can figure out why. But let's sort of go back
to Claire's question earlier, if we see our capital ratio is accreting comfortably above 15%, we're not going to allow
that to happen and we will manage our capital base appropriately for how much capital we need. And the same
way in 2019, we undertook $1 billion buyback as we felt we had the capacity to do that. So, we did it. So if we are
being cautious, that's a good thing. And if we do accrete more capital, then we think because of our caution, then
we'll take against that.

A couple on Hong Kong from the web. One from Ronit Ghose. The Q4 Asia NIM down 5 basis points, is that the
effective run rate for Asia NIM going forward? Can you talk a little about that? And then from [ph] Vincent Gu
(01:07:31) asking about the stage 2 growth in Hong Kong balances in second half and provide a bit more color on
what drove that, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. On Asia NIM, we did see some asset margin compression. The other thing is a significant portion of the
Hong Kong deposit base is US dollar based. So, US dollar interest rates are down. So you will see ongoing
impact of that. Given since I've arrived at the bank trying to predict the trajectory of HIBOR, but we're obviously
very sensitive to the trajectory of HIBOR. And in some ways, as I said earlier, it's sort of linked to the coronavirus

where it's remaining high at the moment. But we would expect HIBOR this year and we've got that in our
economic forecast to decline at some point during the year.
In terms of the stage 2, I mean look, Hong Kong, pre the coronavirus, has been facing some difficult economic
circumstances and all you're seeing is the natural migration, I think of that credit book but Richard will have the
numbers but the underlying if you looked, [ph] without (01:08:46) the quality of Hong Kong credit book is, yeah,
you have to imagine some extremely difficult scenarios. As I said earlier, it's shifting to – assuming coronavirus
continues for most of this year, only gets you to incremental provisioning of $600 million in Hong Kong. So we
don't expect anything like that, but we do expect some increase in provisioning this year.

Ian Gordon Q
Analyst, Investec Bank Plc
Hi. Ian Gordon from Investec. Can I just have one question on the US, please? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't
think there's any suggestion that the US will ever be anything other than a drag to group returns. So, obviously, I
welcome what you've announced, retaking capital out of GBM and slashing costs within the retail business. But in
terms of the reallocation within that geography, is it based on genuine enthusiasm for the opportunities you see?
Or is it based on some other structural restriction, e.g. scale requirements, time it takes to extract capital under
CCAR or something else?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
We do see the plan delivering acceptable returns in the US business over the medium-term. So, we see a
significant increase in returns. That's a combination of the reduction in the balance sheet in the Global Markets
business, a refocusing at the retail business. We do believe there is an opportunity to serve international clients in
the US, but we also believe it's important to have a stable balance sheet in the US to support our global market
leading capabilities in transaction banking and trade, and that the package together is the right package.
We did look hard at what we do in the US and did we look to dispose of the retail business, we looked hard at
that. We don't think that's the right answer. To be honest, if I wanted an easy headline and I wanted an easier day
to day, I'd have just made the decision to sell the US retail business, but I genuinely don't believe that's the right
answer for us as a bank. I don't think it's the right answer for our business in the US or for our business globally.
You got to remember, we are the market leader in global transaction banking business and circa 70% of that
transaction banking business is denominated in US dollars. We cannot put that business at risk by having a
subscale, inappropriate, or high-risk business in the US that is not able to fund itself. So that is an important part
[ph] our buy in (01:11:27) HSBC is that global transaction banking business.
Now, many people said we wouldn't be able to turn around the Mexico retail business five, six years ago, and
were advising us to sell that at that point in time. Well, Nuno's here in the room today, him and his management
team in Mexico have done an excellent job. That business today is growing significantly double-digit year-on-year
and high double-digit, and is generating return on tangible equity today of 15% with strong momentum for future
growth. We have to achieve that same outcome in the US, not just because of the US business, because of what
it means to be in the US for our broader HSBC strategy.

So, the easier decision for me would have been to make the sale decision. The harder decision, gets me less
headlines today and possibly less support, is to do what we believe is right for the bank and that's the decision
we've taken. And we'll give our team the support to do it.
Please remember as well, we've chosen a strategy for retail banking now that is different to the past. In the past
on the East Coast, we were largely a mass market, full service, sub-regional bank in retail banking. On the West
Coast, we were more of an affluent internationally-orientated bank. I don't think it's appropriate to run both
strategies together alongside each other. It's inconsistent. If we're to choose a strategy for retail banking in the
US, it's to support the international and more affluent sector of the marketplace in the US.
And our belief is that's a big market segment. It's in excess of 40 million people. Our brand plays into that market
segment well. It's our job to make sure we can do it profitably and that's what we'll be focused on. But it's a big
enough market segment to be meaningful. In fact, it's bigger than most countries we're in, frankly. And I know – I
don't believe you have to be a full-service national bank in the US in order to make money, but we have to prove
that to you over time.

Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
There's also just a couple of other things that you won't to see on the capital side and the headline numbers that
while I talked about a sort of less than 2% uplift on day one because of Basel reform in the US, there's about a
15% uplift in the numbers. So, while we're showing you a sort of stable RWA picture, actually, that reflects a
significant reduction in RWAs offset by anticipated inflation. So, the Basel reform across the globe is not uniform
in how it impacts different legal entities.
The second thing is, today, if you look at the US filings, you will see that US RWAs are about 40% higher than
PRA RWAs. So, a significant part of this plan is optimizing that gap. And there is significant equity release that's
embedded in this plan out of the US business back to the group over the next three to four years. Part of that
goes to some of the structural issues that I was talking about earlier in terms of the double leverage and
subsidiary complexity that we're dealing with.

Joseph Dickerson Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Hi. It's Joe Dickerson from Jefferies. I guess this is the first restructuring plan, post crisis, that really seeks to
address the middle and back office. Can you give us a sense of how much head count is going to actually come
out of what we used to call the Corporate Centre or corporate HQ?
Secondly, I see that you made a small release of the UK uncertainty overlay and there's I think $311 million left in
that provision, which is a little bit higher than the low end of what you're calling out for coronavirus. What do you
need to see to release the remainder of that? Is it certainty of a trade bill? What are the things we need to look for
because there's pretty much an offset there?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 18-Feb-2020
Noel Quinn A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I'll let Ewen answer the second one and I'll give you an answer on the first if I can. We're not giving individual
head count targets or detail at this stage on either any sub-region or business line or the Centre. What I will say is
I firmly believe that it's absolutely important to not only reduce the cost of the superstructure of HSBC in order to
provide some mitigation to the RWA redeployment program, so that I don't end up with stranded costs.
But I also think it's an important thing to do to empower the organization with greater agility and greater pace to
delayer, de-matrix. And I think we've had a structure in place that served us well, post the financial crisis. And
through the DPA, we had to build up a more substantial complex support structure for the businesses during that
period. But I think in a phase that we're going into we need more agility and simplicity, and therefore that requires
our central cost base to go down. And I want to recreate a much more clinical divide between what is the holding
company or the group of HSBC and that which should be there, separate from that which should be in the
countries to allow the countries to make growth happen. And so, I'm not going to give you any specific head count
targets on that. We can help you try to model that later but nothing at this point in time. On the second point,
Ewen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. We've broken out in one of the slides, about 60% of the cost savings are coming from the middle office and
sort of just personalize it to the bit I run. I mean, if you look at the finance department today, very manual with sort
of poor customer control and cost outcomes. As a result of that, we've got a three- to four-year plan to create a
single data warehouse and heavily use the cloud, which should lead to a dramatic improvement in the productivity
of the department as a result of that.
And we can see similar efficiency programs across much of the back office and middle office. And we've just got a
new COO, John Hinshaw, who's got a deep background in technology and has led similar restructurings at other
organizations he's led. So again both on technology side and the operations side, again, we see significant
opportunity for efficiency benefits, all of which are reflected in today's cost announcement.
On the UK overlay, I think part of what you're seeing is the fact that stressing the UK portfolio under extreme
stress results in higher levels of provisioning than you would see in Hong Kong, because it goes back to the
fundamental credit quality of the Hong Kong business rather than any reflection on the UK. Post the big triggering
event in Q4 for the write-back of part of the overlay was the election, which reduced some of the probabilities
associated with some of the downside scenarios.
I think in terms of releasing a significant amount of further overlay in the UK, we're just going to have to see how
the forward economic guidance shifts during the year with – yeah, there's still quite a broad spectrum of use
around the UK economy, particularly as we continue to negotiate the exit from Europe this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I will say on the UK economy, it surprised me on the upside how resilient the UK corporate base has been
through the three years leading up to the point we're at now.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 18-Feb-2020
One more from the web and then we'll take two more from the floor, Raul and Jon. Still lots of questions on RWAs
and capital and buybacks as you would expect. So one with a slightly different lever from Manus Costello is your
plan assumes 4% to 5% growth in organic RWAs. To fund that, you'd need to get a return above right at the top of
your 10% to 12% RoTE target. What happens if you don't reach to that top end of the range? How will you fund
growth in the future? Or is the dividend at risk? That's from Manus Costello.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, firstly, let me just – and Ewen will cover it, but let me, first of all, make a comment. The RWAs we taken out
are probably yielding at the moment between 2% to 3%. The RWAs we've put in back in we're assuming will yield
much closer to 5% to 6%. So, just taking out one – the RWAs and redeploying them, you're getting a revenue and
a margin uplift as a consequence of that because actually the market segments is going back into a higher
yielding return than the market segments that's coming out of. So, you're going to get that margin enhancement
as a consequence of that transformation program. Ewen?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. I don't think the math was right actually in terms of needing to get to the top end of the 10% to 12% RoTE
range for the reinvestment. That's not what's embedded in the numbers. There's a significant amount of growth
embedded in the plan that's not particularly RWA intensive, particularly around some of the wealth management
franchise.
So, look, ultimately in order for the group to be sustainable with this distribution policy, we need to be targeting
returns of about 11% to 12% return on tangible equity. We think this plan delivers that by 2022. We don't think
2022 is optimized for returns. As I talked about earlier, we're right at the top-end of that 14% to 15% range on
capital. We think we can further optimize that and we think there's more revenue upside as we get the benefit of
the reinvestment of the RWAs. And we think we've got the full run rate benefit of cost still to come through into
2023.
But the previous plan that we set out in June, just over 18 months ago, was very much premised on getting to that
11% RoTE that we think we need to be. The interest rate environment fundamentally changed on us. 2020
interest rates are probably about 150 basis points lower than what we thought that were going to be when that
plan was set up. So, hence, why we've had to adjust the plan, we think this plan gets us back to that place by
2022. And we think it has inherent logic to it, which allows us to sustain the distribution policy and grow the back
at about that 4% to 5% growth rate.

Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Okay. A couple of follow-ups from me. The capital ratio looks like it's going to go backwards in Q1. So, just
wondering if I can follow up on what you said in your opening remarks, Ewen, there's $10 billion of model changes
and there's $10 billion of inflation from – is that from business growth?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 18-Feb-2020
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yes. So we think over this year, there's probably about – well, first of all on the capital ratios, I think it wouldn't be
surprising if it fell back about 20 basis points on the quarter. I'd heavily caveat that because it depends on
coronavirus. But we think there's about $15 billion of headwinds this year on regulatory-related, modeling related
issues that were – for which about $10 billion or just under $10 billion should come through this quarter.
The other $10 billion that we'll see is relating to business growth. Part of that there's always a significant reduction
in balance sheet in Q4, particularly around balance sheet management and part of GB&M that comes back on
early in the new year. But also we're continuing to see decent growth in retail banking and Commercial Banking.
So our current guidance is RWAs will be up about $20 billion or so in Q1.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Thank you. And the second one is on GBM specifically. I think in the past we've looked at divisional returns
across HSBC and I'm struggling to kind of go back to that. Maybe it's not relevant anymore. But can you talk
about where the standalone GBM returns would look like under your plan relative to the 10% to 12% post the
merging of the middle and the back office?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. My only hesitation because we've also got the Corporate Centre reallocation process that we're intending
to roll out in the second half of this year which has some impact on the returns, but this materially improves the
return profile of GB&M through the period of the plan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Is that in the 10% to 12% or it's still below.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Sorry, I'm just struggling to get the numbers right in my head post the reallocation, but relative to the
current returns, the returns are materially high.

John Cronin Q

Thank you. It's John Cronin from Goodbody. Just a few specifically on the UK actually in relation to flow share
development and mortgages and the year-to-date, anything you can say on that. Additionally, the recent modest

improvement and deposit funding conditions in the market, how do you anticipate that will pass through in terms
of pricing or should there – should we expect potentially some NIM accretion there? And finally anything you can
say on the RoTEs you're currently printing on new mortgage flow. I think you gave us some numbers on that
before. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So in terms of flow share in Q4 from mortgages was just over 7%. So, we're continuing quarter-on-quarter to put
on flow share in excess of stock share and mortgages in the UK. We think we can continue to do that. As we've
talked about previously, we have about a 13% to 14% share of current accounts by value. We have about 10%
share of consumer credit, and we're sitting at just under 7% share of our stock mortgages. So we do think there is
a long-term opportunity for us to continue to accrete share in mortgages.
On NIM, I would be a bit cautious, because it continues to be, we don't have it, but the term funding scheme
needs to be refinanced by the sector. It's not obvious to me how that gets refinanced without some pressure on
deposit funding at some point. The new – the return on tangible equity for the new business on mortgages is
comfortably ahead of cost of capital. It's very RoTE equivalent because of relatively there are risk weightings
attached to that business.
The other thing I would say on the return overall in the UK – return on tangible equity the UK, it is impacted
because we have a very large pension surplus. That pension surplus helps in terms of a stress test because we
don't need to hold capital against the pension plan for the stress test, because we've got the surplus. But if you
were to adjust all that out, I think returns for the UK business would be a couple of hundred basis points higher
than we showed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I'd just like to add a couple of comments as well about our plans to create a combined Wealth and Personal
Banking business. There are two principal drivers behind that. One is, and probably the most important one, is
revenue synergy. We believe that bringing the Wealth Management capability of our private bank, and to be able
to extend that product capability and our services to a broader client base gives us significant growth
opportunities in revenue across the whole personal customer base.
Equally, we believe there are benefits in sharing the architecture and the skills that are being developed in – and
the capabilities that are being developed in our Retail Banking business, particularly in the area of digitization,
now we can transfer those benefits into for the benefit of our private bank clients. So, we believe there are
opportunities for growth and revenue from bringing those two businesses together.
There are also some cost synergies, but that is not the primary purpose for doing it. The primary purpose for
doing it is to facilitate future growth. Some of the benefits will be the scale operations that are being built up in
Retail Banking can be leveraged to continue to grow our Private Banking proposition for our Private Banking
clients at a much faster pace without having to correspondently grow the cost base alongside it.
So, we believe that combination is a powerful one. Does – and we also believe the opportunity for continued
growth in our business in the area of wealth management is one that we should focus on, and we're looking at
further activities and strategies that can take that business on to even higher growth rates. So, I just wanted to
add that to the comment on the UK Retail business.
