Heather Worley
Director-Investor Relations & Senior Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss BOK Financial's First Quarter 2024 financial results. Our
CEO, Stacy Kymes, will provide opening comments. Marc Maun, Executive Vice President for Regional Banking,
will cover our loan portfolio and related credit metrics. And Scott Grauer, Executive Vice President of Wealth
Management, will cover our fee-based results. Our CFO, Marty Grunst, will then discuss financial performance for
the quarter and our forward guidance.

Stacy C. Kymes
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Heather. We're excited to welcome Heather to our team. We're pleased to report earnings in the first
quarter of $83.7 million or EPS of $1.29 per diluted share. Adjusting for notable items such as AFS repositioning
and FDIC special assessment, net income would have been $123.2 million and EPS would have been $1.91 per
share.
Before I discuss the highlights from the first quarter, I would like to talk about our strategy. At BOKF, our approach
is based on the long term. We are focused on driving profitability and performance that create sustainable value
for our shareholders. BOK Financial is a full service financial services company with a diversified loan portfolio,
unwavering discipline and credit quality, top tier fee income businesses that produce attractive returns and a solid
core deposit franchise. Our footprint is located in dynamic, high-growth markets, and our strong risk management
culture allows us to remain open for business, actively growing our portfolio during times when others are pulling
back.
We have a seasoned management team with deep bench strength. Our executive leadership team has an
average of 34 years of industry experience and 24 years at this organization.
Through market cycle, we consistently invest in our company's growth. Our ample levels of capital and liquidity
allow us to expand client relationships and take market share when others pull back. Our clear example of this is
our investment in the San Antonio market, which is progressing more favorably than anticipated. We've now
added 13 employees in that market and are already seeing meaningful new business generation.
As a further part of our expansion in Central Texas, we also have 12 wealth employees and seven mortgage
employees in the Austin market. We also added 13 team members for institutional sales team with our Memphis
expansion, which will complement our existing fixed income trading activities.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2024
Talent acquisition is a fundamental part of our strategy. We proactively recruit for our future, knowing that our
greatest asset is our people. I'm thrilled to announce that we were recognized as one of only 60 organizations to
receive the 2024 Gallup Exceptional Workplace Award. This is independent validation of our culture of inspiration,
ambition, collaboration and tenacity.
Discipline is key to generating value. And one differentiator I wanted to highlight for us is our credit culture. If you
look back to the great financial crisis, while our credit costs were well above our own average, we materially
outperformed our peers. This and our holistic risk management focus contributed to us being the largest
traditional bank not to participate in TARP. Industrywide credit costs have been very low over the last several
years, but with growing concerns in the regional banking space, there is renewed focus on credit and particularly
commercial real estate.
We never lost sight of managing credit prudently and believe this is an area where we will continue to outperform
on a relative basis. We have maintained the same credit standards with a consistent credit management team
that led to better credit losses versus peers historically.
We've added a slide to our presentation that shows our historical credit performance by line of business to
highlight our impressive long-term performance. Combining strong historical credit performance with an ongoing
commitment around concentration limits should give investors further confidence in our ability to perform well in
this area moving forward.
We have a commercial real estate concentration limit of 185% of total commitments versus Tier 1 capital and
reserves. And today, we have approximately 22% of outstanding balances in commercial real estate. Over the
years, we have focused on growing our specialty lines of business like energy and health care, which has
increased our core commercial and industrial relationship. We've made investments in our core commercial
businesses over the last several years, and we see those returns evident in the first quarter, with 9% annualized
growth in commercial loans.
Another way you see us taking the long view is in the retention of our VISA Class B stock. Many have fully
monetized their shares since 2008 at a considerable discount. We held on to this position and now expect to
receive full value for the shares we hold.
Moving to slide 5. Period-end loan balances increased $268 million or 1% linked quarter, with growth driven by
commercial loans, and our teams remain confident in our pipelines as we move forward. Both period-end and
average deposits continue to grow this quarter.
Our loan to deposit ratio declined slightly to 68%, remaining well below our peers and providing significant on-
balance sheet liquidity to meet future loan or other liquidity demands. We have now been two consecutive
quarters with a slowing pace of net interest margin declines, and we believe we are at the trough. Our credit
remains very strong and we have a combined reserve of $329 million or 1.36% of outstanding loans at quarter-
end, which is above the median of our peer group.
Finally, we repurchased over 616,000 shares this quarter to reflect our long-term confidence in the company and
to take advantage of attractive repurchase valuations. I'm proud of the quarter that this team has put together and
appreciate the time to review it with you this morning.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Marc.

Marc C. Maun
Executive Vice President-Regional Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Stacy. I wanted to take a moment to reference slide 7 and reinforce Stacy's comments regarding credit.
Our credit culture is fundamental to the way we do business. We have strong underwriting standards that are
calibrated to our experience in each of our lines of business, which involves not only a base evaluation of credit,
but also stress testing during the underwriting process, including all loans being subjected to interest rate shocks.
Our process is a consistent, disciplined approach designed to avoid fluctuating standards based on economic
conditions. Approximately 81% of our commercial and CRE loans are floating rate or repriced in the next year. So,
this variable has always been a principal factor for us. The current credit performance you're seeing in our loan
book is already reflective of higher borrowing rates. We don't have a significant concern over payment shocks.
As we actively manage the book, we monitor credit to identify issues. We are quick to downgrade any loans that
we are concerned with, which can, on occasion, make our criticized ratios look higher than peers. We believe this
proactive management results in better long-term outcomes. If an issue with credit arises, we collaborate with
clients to rehabilitate, exit with full repayment or minimize loss via cooperative effort with management, line
bankers, and our special assets team.
Combining our prudent standards on the front-end during the underwriting process and active management
throughout the life of a loan has historically resulted in very modest credit losses, which is illustrated on slide 7.
Turning to slide 8. Overall loans increased 1.1% linked quarter, with commercial loans up 2.2% and CRE down
1.9%. Portfolio yields increased 4 basis points during the quarter. Loan balances in the energy business
increased 0.2% linked quarter. As a reminder, our energy book is composed of approximately 70% oil-weighted
borrowers and 30% natural gas-weighted borrowers. 92% of the book is first-lien senior secured production with
lending evaluated and stress tested by our in-house engineering staff of 17 full-time employees. Our energy
customers are very well hedged for at least the next year, which meaningfully lowers our commodity pricing risk
on the collateral.
Combined services and general business loans, our core C&I loans, grew 3% linked quarter. Our focus in this
market is on developing full banking relationships through cash flow lending, while structuring our credits with
adequate secondary sources of repayment to minimize our risk.
Our healthcare business loans increased 2.5% linked quarter. Roughly two-thirds of the portfolio is in senior
housing, combining a diversified mix of skilled nursing facilities that are Medicare or Medicaid-based, stabilized,
private pay, senior living, integrated health systems predominantly with investment-grade equivalent ratings, and
other specialized providers.
The healthcare line of business has a national footprint, but is focused on regional operators with multiple
locations for diversity and deep knowledge of their markets. We have a long history of strong underwriting in this
space.
Our CRE business decreased 1.9% quarter-over-quarter. As Stacy mentioned, we manage to strict concentration.
Loans are subjected to multiple stress tests in the underwriting process, including those that stress interest rates
and payment shocks. Setting aside our disciplined underwriting standards, we believe that there are two key
factors that will differentiate our credit performance in this cycle. First is guarantor support. We have meaningful
support in over 90% of our CRE loans, with counterparties that we have known for a long time and have
demonstrated commitment to supporting their transaction.

Second is geographic location. This portfolio is geographically diverse, but importantly, with most exposure within
strong economies in our footprint and very little exposure in the areas of the country that have seen the largest
pullback in prices, such as New York City and Los Angeles, which is shown on the following slide.
On slide 9, you will notice credit quality remains exceptional across the loan portfolio and well below historical
norms and pre-pandemic levels. Non-performing assets, excluding those guaranteed by US government
agencies, decreased $25 million this quarter. The resulting non-performing assets at the period-end loans and
repossessed assets decreased 11 basis points to 51 basis points. Non-accruing loans decreased $26 million
linked quarter.
Committed criticized assets continue to remain well below pre-pandemic levels as a percentage of capital. Net
charge-offs were $5.5 million or 9 basis points annualized for the first quarter and have averaged 10 basis points
over the last 12 months, extending the trend of performance far beyond our historic loss range of 30 basis points
to 40 basis points.
Looking forward, we expect net charge-offs to remain below historical norms. We remain well reserved with a
combined allowance for credit losses of $329 million or 1.36% of outstanding loans at quarter-end, with the $8
million provision reflecting a stable operating environment and loan growth expectations.
The reserve is sufficient to cover our non-performing assets by three times. We believe the combined reserve is
the most appropriate metric to consider if you want a holistic view of comparative credit reserve levels. We expect
to continue to maintain an appropriate reserve, supporting loan growth and reflective of economic conditions.
As I mentioned in my opening comments, we have traditionally outperformed during challenging credit cycles and
are well-positioned should an economic slowdown materialize.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.

Scott Bradley Grauer
Executive Vice President-Wealth Management & Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc., BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Marc. Turning to slide 11. I'm excited to speak to our Wealth Management, Mortgage and TransFund
businesses. These are businesses that we have been committed to for a long time and run as deep as our roots.
In 1918, we launched the first trust company in Oklahoma and added asset management in 1949, demonstrating
our commitment to innovative financial services for our clients.
Today, BOKF provides a rock solid foundation of stability, knowledge and experience that individuals, families and
institutions can rely on. We operate these fee income businesses at scale, which gives us strong operational
leverage and the ability to compete well with larger organizations. We made the strategic decision to invest in
these and other high ROE fee income businesses that provide revenue diversity, which has played out well for us.
41% of BOKF's revenue comes from fee income businesses, which is a peer leading contribution to earnings and
provides stability, especially when net interest income exhibits volatility.
To mention a few stats that demonstrate the scale and strength of these businesses, we are a top 10 dealer of
agency mortgage-backed securities, the number one underwriter and financial advisor of Texas Independent
School District Bonds for 2023, the eight largest corporate trustee bank ranked by number of trusteeships, a top
10 electronic funds transfer processor in the United States through our TransFund business, which provides debit
and credit issuing processing or EFT for almost 500 banks and credit unions throughout the US, representing

close to 1 billion transactions last year alone. And finally, we're a top 50 US mortgage originator, and service over
21 billion in mortgage loans, representing more than 122,000 accounts.
Turning to this quarter, total fee income contributed $200.6 million of revenue, representing 41% of total revenue.
I'll first cover the detail of our markets and securities businesses again on slide 11. Our trading fees, which are
constituted primarily in fixed income trading, increased by 5.4% to $37.5 million during the quarter, driven by
slightly higher trading volumes and spreads versus the prior quarter. Mortgage banking revenue increased 48% to
$19 million. This was driven by improvement in the mortgage origination market and positive seasonal trends
resulting in increased volume.
Margins have also increased as the pooling of COVID-19 forbearance loans we previously repurchased continues
to migrate lower, now reaching some of their lowest historical levels. As a reminder, brokerage and insurance was
down 24% to $4.7 million. This was due to the exit of BOK Financial Insurance in the fourth quarter last year.
Turning to slide 12 to cover our asset management and transaction businesses. Asset management revenue has
also increased 8% to $55.3 million, driven by an increase in AUMA of just under $800 million, with spreads
increasing slightly. Transaction card revenue decreased by 11.6% to $25.5 million, driven by normalized activity
following elevated levels experienced in Q4.
Fee-based businesses tend to have a higher return on capital versus traditional net interest income related
businesses, but also, a higher efficiency ratio as you must build scale and cost structure to operate them
effectively. Therefore, as you see with the percentage of fee income increase, you should expect to see a higher
efficiency ratio and a higher return on capital.
And now, I'll hand the call over to Marty to cover the financials.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Scott. Let me start by covering two items in the quarter. First, we accrued $6.5 million as an estimate
of the additional special assessment we expect from the FDIC in June of this year. Second, as previously
disclosed, we've repositioned a portion of our securities portfolio in March, taking a $45 million pre-tax charge for
the quarter, which will improve net interest income going forward.
We hold VISA B shares that are currently equivalent to 400,420 common shares. VISA's exchange program was
initiated on April 8 and should allow us to monetize 50% of our B shares in the second quarter. The anticipated
gain from this exchange in Q2 should more than offset the $45 million securities loss we took in Q1, leaving a
residual amount that we expect to contribute to our charitable foundation in Q2.
And one last observation on this topic, when it comes to portfolio restructuring, our focus is on generating
incremental economic value. And we look for the earn-back period to be shorter than the weighted average life of
the securities involved. For the Q1 transaction, the payback period was roughly 2 years versus a weighted
average life of 3.4 years for the securities sold, indicating a very good economic pickup.
Turning to slide 14, capital and liquidity continue to be robust, driven by our risk management framework, which
recognizes the capital liquidity and interest rate risk management are all interconnected disciplines. Our adjusted,
tangible common equity ratio, inclusive of all securities portfolio losses, stands at 7.9%. When comparing this
capital metric to that of the 20 largest banks in the US as of Q4 2023, ours is the third highest.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2024
Additionally, we have strong capital ratios across each of the regulatory capital metrics. Our current loan to
deposit ratio stands at 68%, and our coverage of uninsured and non-collateralized deposits has remained robust
at 179% with this quarter's deposit growth of $1.4 billion.
Being very well-positioned in capital and liquidity has enabled us to actively pursue organic growth opportunities
as well as share buybacks. During the first quarter, we repurchased just over 616,000 shares of common stock at
an average price of $83.89 per share. We will continue to be opportunistic about share repurchase over the
coming quarters.
Turning to slide 15, first quarter net interest income was $293.6 million and the pace of decline continued to
subside as expected. The linked quarter decrease was $3.1 million, with $1 million of that due to day count. Net
interest margin was 2.61%, a 3 basis point decrease compared to Q4, primarily driven by DDA migration, and to a
lesser extent, by deposit repricing. At the end of the first quarter, our through the cycle deposit beta was 68% and
DDA was 24% of total deposits.
Turning to slide 16, linked quarter total expenses decreased $43.7 million or 11.4%, mostly attributable to the
FDIC special assessment in the prior quarter. We recognized the initial assessment of $43.8 million in the fourth
quarter and another $6.5 million in the first quarter. This results in a linked quarter decline of $37.3 million and
explains most of the total expense decline in the quarter. All remaining expenses were largely consistent with
prior quarter activity.
Turning to slide 17, this provides our outlook for 2024. We have good momentum in commercial loan growth and
expect total loan growth on a period-end basis to be 5% to 7%. We've provided a numeric range on this item, but
our outlook is basically the same as it was last quarter. We believe net interest margin has reached the trough
and total net interest income for 2024 will be just over $1.2 billion.
We did assume 2 rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2024, consistent with the forward curve as of a couple of
weeks ago. We expect 2024 provision expense to be similar to 2023 levels and the combined reserves to total
loans ratio to remain steady as we grow outstandings and economic conditions persist.
With that, I would like to hand the call back to the operator for Q&A, which will be followed by closing remarks
from Stacy.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jon Arfstrom from RBC Capital
Markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can you hear me all right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
We can now, Jon. It's good to hear from you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, good, good. On slide 8, I don't know if it's for you, Stacy or Marc, but can you touch a little bit on the
general business trends you're seeing in terms of the pipelines? I know Marc, you combine services and general
business, but I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of the pipelines and if they're changing at all?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So far when we're looking at our C&I pipelines, we still see pretty good strength. I mean, our effort has
been out to take advantage of opportunities, given our liquidity position, our credit metrics and so forth, to be open
for business and active calling efforts. And when some of our competitors have pulled back a little, we've been
able to build the pipeline pretty well.
When you're looking at healthcare, it's been growing pretty well. Also, energy is just more reflective of just some
of the things that are going on in the economy right now. So, overall, we expect to continue to see the kind of
growth on the commercial side that we experienced in the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Jon, this is Stacy. I mean, I think if you think about it – kind of how we think about it, I mean, commercial growth
broadly, given our footprint, given kind of our liquidity and capital position, we're really optimistic about that. I
mean, the business lines are very excited about kind of their pipelines and what they see coming over time. I think
the only real headwind that we don't know how to forecast particularly well is how commercial real estate will
behave, whether we get paydowns there.
If we do, it takes time to kind of replace those over time. We have plenty of headroom in commercial real estate to
make loans today, but it takes a little while there. And so that, I think I mentioned on the call last quarter, that was
really the only wild card we had, I think, from our guidance. And I still think that's true today. I think we're very
optimistic about commercial, [ph] bank (00:23:53) commercial real estate. We're optimistic about our ability to
grow the commitments there. But the timing of when those will fund will be the wildcard relative to payoffs there.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, that's helpful. And then, just one for you, Marty. Not a lot to pick on here, but you talked about DDA
migration, and curious how you're feeling about that and is the pressure burning out there? Any themes you'd like
to call out on the DDA migration?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure, yes. And we do think that the pressure is burning out, as you say. So, if you look just within the quarter, the
declines we saw were pretty much all in January. So, February and March were pretty much leveled out. And
then, even as you look into April, we saw a little bit of build in April pre-tax season, and then, on April 16th, that
came out and gets us, where that all landed, was still consistent with where we were in February and March. So,
that gives us pretty good confidence that that is reaching a burnout point there.
I do think there is still just a little bit more to go, so don't think that it's absolutely done, but we feel pretty good
about the outlook.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Hi, Peter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Your credit trends have been outstanding. I think you guys are one of the few banks to see a decline in non-
performing assets. Could you just provide a little bit more color on the criticized and problem loans? And then
secondly, I just guess based on the provision expense guidance, you're still expecting that higher net charge-offs
in the second half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I'll take the second part of that first. With regards to provision, we don't really anticipate higher net charge-
offs for the balance of the year. Our indications are based on criticized classified levels, non-performing
improvement that we'll see something more consistent with what we have experienced in the last few quarters.
The higher provision would come about through loan growth, and that would be the driver for it and the desire to
keep our percentage reserve relatively flat to the overall loan portfolio.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2024
With regards to the individual criticized assets and so forth, we don't see anything that is systemic in any
particular portfolio. And in fact our – some of our CRE has come down and we've been able to exit a number of
our non-performing loans, which was one of the results of why we had a reduction in the last quarter as opposed
to charge-offs. So, we've been able to manage our criticized and classified effectively, and we just think that it's
going to be continue to be reflected in the future based on what we're seeing today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Peter, [indiscernible] (00:26:58) about the credit quality here. I think that you rightfully point out that's a big part of
our story this quarter. I think that we differentiate ourselves here in terms of how we underwrite and how we think
about that. We can have strong asset quality and good growth. And I think we're doing both of those here.
Our kind of forecasting in asset quality is good for about six months, and then, it gets real heavy. And so the
reason we've kind of talked about maybe in the back half of the year is mostly just the expectation at some point
that there'll be a reversion to the mean and things will start to look like they did pre-COVID.
We thought maybe we were heading that direction in the fourth quarter. We had modest deterioration in criticized
and classified, and that kind of we were starting to begin at migration. But that did not play out in the first quarter
and our outlook here is very positive based on what we know about the book and how we see the current
criticized, classified, non-performing behaving today. And so we feel really good.
Understand at some point, I've been teasing a lot internally about – I keep saying it's unsustainably good, but it is,
but it feels like it's going to stay that way for at least the next six months or so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. That's really helpful. And then, on a separate question, you did maintain the fee income guidance in despite
the updated outlook for two rate cuts. The previous guidance was no rate cuts. And you had mentioned like lower
rates would actually benefit fee income. So, would you lean more towards maybe the upper end of the range now
that you've got some rate cuts built into your forecast?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, Peter, I'd say that we do feel good about the trajectory within that business. Mortgage is certainly – even
saw a lift in mortgage and that will be sustainable, and that's certainly helped by that. The trading businesses are
supported by that kind of environment. And then, the fiduciary businesses are also supported by that
environment, just given the asset there, the impact on asset valuation. So, yeah, we feel great about, about that
line item.

with rate cuts?

Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Executive Vice President-Wealth Management & Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc., BOK Financial Corp.
The only thing I would add – this is Scott, is that on the trading front we settled into kind of an uncertainty period
whether we're going to be looking at rate cuts or not. And as you can see from the first quarter, the business
levels and the activities continue to be slightly elevated even without the cuts. So, we feel good about where we're
positioned, really regardless of the direction that the Fed might take there.

Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hey, good morning.

Good morning, Ben.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
I was just curious in terms of just the, I guess, the growth kind of numerical fine-tuning, some of your competitors
have kind of indicated the back half of the year. Whereas, others and the same footprint have also said kind of
more linear, just if you exclude the CRE kind of noise and paydown potential, like should we expect growth to be
fairly linear from here through the end of year or is it a little bit more weighted towards the back half?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
That's a tough question to answer. I think generally speaking, it's going to be linear more so than weighted in the
back half. I think that's my expectation. But as you know, loan growth is lumpy. You have a month where it's flat
and you have a month where it's bigger. But over time, that trajectory should be pretty steady and more linear
from my perspective than back-loaded.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2024
Got you. That's helpful. And then, I know that you now have two cuts in the guidance. At the beginning of the
year, we've talked about how this quarter's probably the margin trough, and it seems like it should be. But if you
kind of look at a little bit of a mosaic here in terms of rate cut potentially, if there are no rate cuts, do you have any
sense of where the margin might be at the end of the year, assuming your normal mix shift and flows that you're
anticipating?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, Ben. So, whether we do get those two rate cuts or not we still think that our margin troughs here and see
some stability here in the middle of the year, and then, you get an uptick later in the year. You know, the – our
benefit that we get out of rate cuts is more from the fact that you get a steeper curve, and that's something that
builds over time. You don't get a like a gigantic benefit in one quarter from that. So, either way we see the margin
coming up towards the end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
I mean, I think that's the important point that as you think about us on a go-forward basis, think less about rate
movements impacting net interest revenue or margin absolutely, because we tend to be pretty neutral from a rate
risk perspective. But think more about a steepening of the yield curve. To the extent that there's a steepening,
we're going to materially benefit from that over time. And so, that the steepening effect has a much bigger impact
to us than the absolute whether rates go up or down on the short end.

Hey, guys. So, I wanted to touch on the deposit growth you guys saw this quarter. I mean, it was obviously fairly
notable. I was just hoping you could maybe just touch on what went right for you guys in the quarter. I know
you've called out as well trying to maybe swaps and borrowings and then replace with the deposits. Could you
just talk us through some of the dynamics that you saw in the quarter and maybe what drove that nice growth?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2024
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, Will, that was us making our offers to our existing customer base. And as we've talked about before we
have a large portion of our customer base that has both money held on balance sheet of their liquid assets. Some
of it's held on balance sheet and some of that's held in our broker/dealer or the wealth business, and that we're
able to toggle that back and forth with calling efforts. And so we just did some of that and that was very fruitful.
And that just worked out exactly as designed for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Jones Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, just with respect to the deposit growth guidance, it feels like maybe a lot of that growth is just
pulled forward in the first part of the year here. And is the thought that deposit balances maybe just kind of level
out and flat-line for the remainder of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. As a general rule, we want to keep deposit growth and loan growth more or less lined up. We were very
comfortable with that. 70% loan to deposit ratio area, defining that as a broader area. And so, yeah, it's
reasonable to think that those are going to be kind of in line the rest of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Jones Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, great. And then back to the margin discussion here so maybe margin troughs this quarter, we
see stability and then up margin at the end of the year. Does that kind of imply that deposit costs will peak maybe
in the third quarter or late in the second quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yes. So, I don't know that I'd say deposit cost peak in particular. But the couple of drivers that are positive for
margin are the fixed rate securities portfolio. Each quarter, $500 million or a little more will reprice from the lower
existing rate to reprice up to current rates. The same dynamic happens in the loan book a little smaller dollar
amount, but the same dynamic of pricing up, that fixed rate portion of the loan book. And those continue for a
while in multiple quarters.
And then, on the deposit side, you're just seeing each quarter, the deposit pressure just gets less and less. And
so that gets much smaller. It might not go to actual zero, but the lines cross here, we believe, this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Jones Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, guys.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2024
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning, Timur.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Following up on the last line of commentary, just looking at time deposits of [indiscernible] (00:36:13) was the
average rate for the quarter. What's kind of the terminal rate there and what is the offer that's currently being
promoted in your markets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yes. So, if you just look at our highest offer, you see, depending on term, it's kind of [ph] $485 million to $510
million (00:36:33) would be the highest particular offer. And that's not every market has the same offer, but that's
the high point. And we actually brought those down versus a quarter ago by 5 or 10 basis points. And so that
gives you a sense for a little bit of the easing pressure that we're seeing.
It's hard to say exactly what the endpoint is because it's – not everything goes to that high offer because that
particular term merged with particular specials. So, it's the terminal point is certainly lower than that, and it'll just
kind of depend on the mix within that portfolio. But you're right, that does kind of [indiscernible] (00:37:18)
slowdown, if you will, over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, maybe just your broader appetite for time deposits here. So, loan to deposit ratio now below
70%, you have plenty balance sheet liquidity. Is your appetite still the same for time deposits or could we actually
see some of those maturities maybe roll off during the course of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Those are all core customers. I mean, none of that is anything that's like brokered or any of that. So, it's not like
there's a piece that is just going to roll off and go away. We're going to serve what customers are after. And so a
fair amount of that's in the consumer book. And so that's just kind of natural how a consumer book matures over a
rate – this part of the rate cycle. So, we would expect that to continue to grow slowly as that consumer book just
naturally makes that trend.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
And if you're concerned that we're adding the CDs at the time when the market's beginning to see rate declines
and so does that lock you into some higher cost of funds because of the growth there? You know, we're set up
and we can swap those back to floating, through our treasury function as we begin to have a view around that so
that we're not necessarily locked into that from a fixed rate perspective.
15


BOK Financial Corp.
(BOKF) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2024 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2024
We think that's a core deposit gathering operation that we need to have consistently going on. And so how we
think about that will toggle with whether we swap it back to floating or really around our interest rate risk profile
and how we think about that. But you have to think about it more holistically than just that particular line item.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
And those maturities are in the within a year and some go a little bit longer in a year. Those line up well with the
fixed rate portion of the loan book, and like Stacy said, to the extent that they don't line up well, very easily swap
those. So, that'll work out well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. That's good color. And then, maybe just a couple around the credit side. So, looking at healthcare
specifically, and I'm referring to slide [indiscernible] (00:39:28). We're seeing broader issues kind of pop up across
the industry within that sector. And then, you look at your healthcare portfolio pre-pandemic and post-pandemic,
and the results are pretty stark. I guess, what changed in your maybe underwriting or anything else that's driving
such outperformance post-pandemic in that portfolio versus higher levels of charge-off activities in 2017, 2018
and 2019?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, I don't know that our – I don't see our performance is materially different here. I mean, healthcare, over a
broad range of time, has been a very strong asset quality portfolio for us. It's always had more volatility around
criticized and classified level because the risk in that portfolio that we see is typically classification risk, not loss
risk.
And so, our historical performance from a loss perspective in the healthcare book has been very strong. We had a
couple of non-core type healthcare loans 7, 8 years ago that we had some losses around. But the portfolio is
structured today around senior housing and healthcare systems and doctor practice groups and things like that.
That portfolio has been around for a long time and has been a very strong credit performer for us and how we
underwrite, it's consistent and we feel really good about that.
I don't think you're always vulnerable to having some classification risk in the healthcare book just because of the
nature of it, but the loss history, which is really what we focus on, has been very stable in the core businesses that
we're in today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. And the only thing I'll add is there was just a segment of healthcare that we were in early or mid-2010s that
we exited like in 2017, 2018, that is no longer part of the portfolio. The core portfolio has always been the senior
housing, which has been the stable portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q

And just last for me. I know it's a small component, but maybe the NPL inflows from commercial real estate. What
asset classes were those in and any kind of underlying thread between some of those migrations?

Could you ask that again? You cut out for us just a second.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Sure. So, the NPL migration this quarter for our commercial real estate, what sectors those were in, and if there's
any kind of underlying thread that tie those loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, I mean, if you look at non-performing loans for commercial real estate, really modest increase, it's mostly
attributable to single office facility. We took a modest charge-off on it this quarter, and we expect it to be sold for
no additional loss content by the end of the quarter. So, we don't have any specific concerns around loss content
today. Really was a single, largely comprised of a single loan there, which is the increase there.

Good morning, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Just a general question. I want to ask about the overall level of competition within your core lending businesses. I
think over the last few quarters, we've talked about competitors pulling back and providing some opportunities for
the bank to add new customers. I'm just curious if there's any change here. Are these competitors kind of still on
their back feet, and then, just kind of any update on loan spreads? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
I think the – what you saw really was some of the regional banks and the larger regional banks trying to manage
their capital levels and liquidity levels. And so we're less aggressive, particularly, on the larger end of the
17


BOK Financial Corp.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2024
corporate side, and we've seen some benefit from that. I would say, generally speaking, they're starting to put
their toe back in the water a little bit, not maybe like they were before last spring, but starting to come back into
the market a little bit there.
I think that – I think spreads are generally on the larger, in the corporate side, are going to be stable. I think until
we get more clarity around Basel III Endgame, and then, maybe they widened a little bit there as folks figure out
what the capital structure has to be.
But generally speaking, I would say corporate spreads have remained relatively flat, and that's our expectation
that we see today, even with some being less aggressive perhaps than they've been in the past.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Appreciate that, Stacy. And then, on the expense side, appreciate that the guidance here that you gave, no
rule change. But just remind me of the variability of that expense base. And if we were to assume the higher end
of fees for the year, is it also reasonable that we should be assuming the higher end of the expense guidance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, on two businesses in particular, Mortgage and Brokerage and Trading those have a pretty direct link
into the expense base. But those are really the two that you see that tight connectivity.
And then, just generally on expenses we'll continue to make investments in the IT space. And so the fees, the
third-party fees and the data processing costs, you might see some variability there. And then, as you kind of
know the mortgage expenses, those are seasonally low in the first quarter and those are predictably a little higher
than the other three quarters. But those are the only things I'd point out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So, I noticed that unfunded commitments ticked down in the quarter. So, I was wondering if you could provide us
any context behind that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
The only thing we've really seen is we've been able to generate new business, and a lot of it is not being actively
used yet. We're in the construction piece of it that has to fund up over time. And on the commercial side, we've
just seen utilization stay flat while we've added new customers. So, the unfunded commitments is a reflection of
just increased commitments overall and stable utilization rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Other than the commercial real estate...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then – and lastly, for me just in regards to commercial real estate, could you give us an
update on what you're seeing in regards to extensions for loans that come up for maturity and just where
customers are at as far as their request?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think it's kind of business as usual for the most part. I mean, I think that as loans mature or come close to
maturity we work through that just like we have in any typical cycle. I think that, at least, thus far, it just doesn't
appear a whole lot different than any kind of normal course of business.
Borrowers have the option for us to do some kind of mini-perm financing. So, where you would put it on an
amortization schedule if it's through the construction phase, and if the permanent market isn't accepting at that
particular point in time, they can do what we call a mini-perm with us. The loan amortizes, and typically, a three-
year type term. And then, they can kind of wait for the capital markets or the permanent financing markets to get
in a better place.

But really, what we've seen, and I mean, we've got a very healthy portfolio. I mean, the first quarter we had really
good payoffs in the commercial real estate book, which we really attribute to kind of having a healthy portfolio.
And so, it doesn't – we're not seeing anything that's kind of out of the ordinary there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. The payoff levels that we saw this quarter were much higher than the last couple of quarters and almost felt
like just normal course of business repayment rates in that portfolio, which, like Stacy said, indicates just a pretty
healthy underlying portfolio.

Stacy C. Kymes A

We said from the very beginning, commercial real estate, there's two things that matter geography and recourse.
And I think that that's really bearing out. And so, the fact that we have 90% of our commercial real estate loans
have some form of guarantor support and recourse is a differentiator here. And we're really seeing that show up in
our portfolio.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, largely permanent financing sources. So, Lifecos anywhere that you typically see a longer term non-

other banks.
