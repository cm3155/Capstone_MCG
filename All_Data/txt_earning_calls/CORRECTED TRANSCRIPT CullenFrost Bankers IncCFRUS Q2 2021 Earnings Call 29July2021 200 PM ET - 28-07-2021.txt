Phillip D. Green
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, AB, and good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review second quarter results for
Cullen/Frost, and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, will also provide additional comments before we open
it up to you for your questions.
In second quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $116.4 million or $1.80 a share compared with earnings of $93.1 million or
$1.47 a share reported in the same quarter last year, and compared with $113.9 million or $1.77 a share in the
first quarter. In the current environment, our company is in a strong position to benefit from the rebound in
economic activity. And we will continue our organic growth strategy while taking steps to enhance Frost's
experience for our customers and our employees.
As expected, economic conditions have continued to weigh on conventional loan demand. Overall, average loans
in the second quarter were $17.2 billion, a decrease of 1.7% compared to $17.5 billion in the second quarter of
last year. Excluding PPP loans, second quarter average loans of $14.6 billion represented a decline of 3%
compared to second quarter of 2020.
However, we're seeing evidence of loan growth beginning to materialize as a non-PPP loans trended up in the
month of June and that upward trend has continued into July. Average deposits in the second quarter were $38.3
billion, an increase of more than 22% compared with $31.3 billion in the second quarter of last year. Our return on
average assets and average common equity in the second quarter were 1.02% and 11.18% respectively.
We did not report a credit loss expense for the second quarter. Our asset quality outlook is stable. And in general,
problem assets are declining in number. New problems have dropped significantly and/or at pre-pandemic levels.
Net charge-offs for the second quarter totaled $11.6 million compared with $1.9 million in the first quarter.
Annualized net charge-offs for the second quarter were 4 basis points of average loans.
Non-accrual loans were $57.3 million at the end of the second quarter, a slight increase from $51 million at the
end of the first quarter and primarily represented the addition of three smaller energy loans which had previously
been identified as problems. A year ago non-accrual loans stood at $79.5 million.
Overall delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the second quarter were $97.3 million or 59 basis points of
period-end loans and were at manageable pre-pandemic levels. We've discussed in the past $2.2 billion and 90-
day deferrals granted to borrowers earlier in the pandemic. As of the end of the second quarter, there were no
active deferrals.
Total problem loans which we define as risk grade 10 and higher were $666 million at the end of the second
quarter compared with $774 million at the end of the first quarter. I'll point out the energy loans decline as a
percentage of our portfolio falling to 6.98% of our non-PPP portfolio at the end of the second quarter as we
continue to make progress toward a mid-single digit concentration level this portfolio over time.
Our teams continue to analyze the non-energy portfolio segments that we considered most at risk from pandemic
impacts. As of the second quarter, those segments are restaurants, hotels, and entertainment, and sports. Of
these portfolio segments, the total excluding PPP loans represented $675.1 billion at the end of the second
quarter. And our loan loss reserve for these segments was 8.6%. The credit quality of these individual credits in
these segments is currently mostly stable or better compared to the end of the first quarter.

We also continue to add to our customer base. Through the midpoint of this year, we added 7% more new
commercial relationships than we did in 2020, which included the outsized second quarter of 2020 when PPP
activity was so strong. Looking at recent trends, our new commercial relationships were 511 in the fourth quarter
of 2020, 554 in the first quarter of this year, and 643 in our most recent quarter. So we're seeing good momentum
in this area.
We're also seeing good momentum in the insurance business, particularly, in the benefits and property and
casualty segment, we're up about 6% in both of those in terms of new customers. And also as many others, we're
seeing good growth in wealth management from assets under management with these good markets, but we've
also seen an increase of around 3% in new customers.
In the time since we began our PPP efforts, just under 1,000 new commercial relationships identified our
assistance in the PPP process as a significant reason for moving to Frost. New loan commitments booked during
the second quarter, excluding PPP loans, were up by 9% compared to the second quarter last year, and up by
45% on a linked-quarter basis. Our current weighted pipeline is 12% higher than one year ago, 17% higher than
last quarter and 38% higher than the same time in 2019. The increases are mostly due to C&I.
Our current weighted pipeline is as high as it's ever been. So we hope this points for a good third quarter for
booking new loans. At the same time, it has to be said that competition is intense. In total, the percentage of deals
lost to structure of 56% was down from the 75% we saw this time last year. But that's really more a factor of the
increase in price competition rather than more market discipline around structure.
We were extremely proud to have completed our 25 branch Houston expansion initiative in the second quarter
and we continue to be very pleased with the results. It represents a tremendous achievement for our outstanding
staff.
Let me update you where we stand through the second quarter and it excludes PPP loans. Our numbers of new
households were 141% of target and represents almost 11,000 new individuals and businesses. Our loan
volumes were 215% of target and represented $310 million in outstandings and about 80% represented
commercial credits with about 20% consumer. Regarding deposits, at $433 million, they represent 116% of target
and they represent about two-thirds commercial and one-third consumer.
Once again, I hope that we've shown that the character of the business we're generating through the expansion is
very consistent with the overall company. And its profitability is weighted towards small- and mid-sized
businesses and complemented by consumer as well as other lines of business including wealth management and
insurance.
Consumer banking also continues to see outstanding growth. In just the first six months of this year, we've
already surpassed our all-time annual growth for new customer relationships. This represents about 13,500 net
new checking customers. Our previous high was 12,700 for full year 2019 and it's all organic growth. We worked
hard to lower barriers to entry for potential customers with improved product offerings and our geographic
expansion. Houston accounts for about one-third of this relationship growth. Their annual growth rate for
consumer customers is up over 13%.
That compares to 4% in 2018 before we started the expansion.
We were excited to announce this month that we launched a new feature called Early Payday which gives
customers access to direct deposits up to two days before the money arrives in their account. And we put this in
4


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
place in time for customers to see the effect from the IRS Child Tax Credit Payments. And we've already heard
great comments from customers who've used Early Payday to pay bills. This makes a difference in the lives of
people who live paycheck to paycheck, and that was on top of our $100 overdraft grace feature that we rolled out
in April.
Also earlier this month, we reached an ATM branding partnership with Cardtronics that will result in us having
more than 1,725 ATMs in our network across Texas. That is by far the largest ATM network in the state. But just
as important, it gives us the largest ATM network in the Dallas-Fort Worth region as we began our expansion in
Dallas early next year.
I mentioned PPP earlier and how our efforts help thousands of small business. And we closed out second round
of PPP with more than 13,000 loans for $1.4 billion. And combined with the first round, that gives us a PPP
program total of more than 32,000 loans and $4.7 billion in outstandings.
The historic effort that Frost Bankers put into helping borrowers get PPP loans is now shifted to the forgiveness
process because borrowers for the first round are approaching payment dates if they don't apply for forgiveness.
We've increased our communication to them and worked on ways to make the forgiveness application process
simpler. We've already submitted 21,000 forgiveness applications and received approval on nearly 19,100 of
them or $3 billion, that's close to the entire first round total.
We continue to be optimistic about the economy and what lies ahead. We have the best team in the financial
services industry, and thanks to them, we'll continue to grow and extend our unique value proposition to more
customers.
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, for some additional comments.

Thank you, Phil. Looking first at our net interest margin, our net interest margin percentage for the second quarter
was 2.65%, down 7 basis points from the 2.72% reported last quarter. The decrease was impacted by a higher
proportion of earning assets being invested in lower-yielding balances to Fed in the second quarter as compared
to the first quarter, partially offset by the positive impact of the PPP loan portfolio.
Interest-bearing deposits at the Fed averaged $13.3 billion or 31% of our earning assets in the second quarter, up
from $9.9 billion or 25% of earning assets in the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of PPP loans, our net interest
margin percentage would have been 2.37% in the second quarter, down from an adjusted 2.59% for the first
quarter with all of the decrease resulting from the higher level of balances at the Fed in the second quarter.
The taxable equivalent loan yield for the second quarter was 4.28%, up 41 basis points from the previous quarter
and was impacted by an acceleration of PPP forgiveness during the quarter, which accelerated the recognition of
the associated deferred fees. Excluding the impact of PPP loans, the taxable equivalent loan yield would have
been 3.80%, up 3 basis points from the prior quarter.
To add some additional color on our PPP loans, forgiveness payments received accelerated during the quarter,
totaling $1.3 billion compared to the $580 million received in the prior quarter. As a result of the accelerated
forgiveness, interest income including fees on PPP loans totaled about $45 million in the second quarter, up
significantly from the approximately $30 million recorded in the first quarter. Given our current projections on the
speed of forgiveness of the remainder of our PPP loans, we currently expect that the interest income on PPP

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
loans recognized in the third quarter would be less than one-half of the $45 million recorded in the second
quarter.
Total forgiveness payments through the second quarter were approximately $2.7 billion. In total, PPP loans at the
end of June were $1.9 billion, down from the $3.1 billion at the end of March. At the end of the second quarter, we
had approximately $38 million in net deferred fees remain to be recognized and we currently expect a little over
70% of that to be recognized this year.
Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged $12.3 billion during the second quarter,
up about $46 million from the first quarter. The taxable equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was 3.36% in
the second quarter, down 5 basis points from the first quarter. The yield on the taxable portfolio which average
$4.2 billion was 2.01%, down 5 basis points from the first quarter as a result of higher premium amortization
associated with our agency MBS securities given faster prepayments.
Our municipal portfolio averages about $8.1 billion during the second quarter down $104 million from the first
quarter with a taxable equivalent yield of 4.09% flat with the prior quarter. At the end of the second quarter, 78%
of the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF insured. The duration of the investment portfolio at the end of
the second quarter was 4.4 years in line with the first quarter. Investment purchases during the quarter were
approximately $680 million and consisted of about $400 million in municipal securities with a TE yield of about
2.30% and about $190 million in 20-year treasuries with the remainder in MBS securities.
Regarding noninterest expense. Looking at the full-year 2021, we currently expect an annual expense growth rate
of around 3% from our 2020 total reported noninterest expenses. And regarding income tax expense, the effective
tax rate for the quarter was 11.3%, up from the 6.4% reported in the first quarter as a result of higher earnings but
also impacted by lower tax benefits realized from employee stock option activity in the second quarter as
compared to the first. We currently are projecting a full-year 2021 effective tax rate in the range of 9% to 9.5%.
Regarding estimates for full-year 2021 earnings, given our second quarter results and recognition of lower PPP
accretion for the remainder of the year, we currently believe the current mean of analyst estimate at $6.33 is
reasonable.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

Truist Securities. Your line is open.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Good afternoon.

Hi, Jennifer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
I'm just wondering if you could talk about the branch expansion and kind of the deposits and loan balances in the
new offices at this point in Houston? And how many offices you expect to open in Dallas and over what
timeframe?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Okay. As I mentioned, the character of the business that we're generating the branches looks pretty close to what
we do in the overall company. It is about two-thirds commercial at this point on deposits, about a third consumer.
That's a little bit higher than our bank totals on commercial consumer mix were probably somewhere between
55% and 60% on the commercial, if you look at the total company, I think that's pretty close.
And if you look at your loans, 80% commercial and 20% consumer. If you look at the 80% commercial number, I
think the biggest component of that is going to be traditional C&I loans. Second largest would be owner-occupied
real estate of that type of thing. I can tell you, Jennifer, that we've been seeing the size of loan that we're doing in
the expansion branches has been increasing, but it's still deeply core. I think the latest numbers I saw, only had
like three relationships that had loans of $10 million and more. So, this is really good core business for us. And I
think the last number I saw is the average loan size about $1.2 million.
And if you go back several months that would been probably more like $750,000 in really round number. So,
we're seeing those numbers get a little bit larger but we're not elephant hunting. And I think that's good for us. And
I think that it really shows that two things. One, I think the economy is improving, so you get a little bit more
demand. But I also think that the new bankers are becoming the custom to our systems and our underwriting and
our offerings and they're also being more successful prospecting.
So, that's what we're seeing on the loan side there. I'll tell you that in Dallas, I really believe it's going to be very
consistent with what we see in Houston market. You can't argue that Dallas might have even a little bit more
7

diversified economy than Houston because of the impact of energy on the Houston market. Dallas, I think is
known for in general business. I think it's got over 10,000 corporate headquarters there, from an old number that I
remember hearing. And I think that our, kind of, business banking is going to resonate very well there. And it has
already – I think Dallas has had a pretty good year so.
I think we'll see pretty much the same kind of impact. I was really glad for us to be able get the opportunity to
create that number one ATM network in the DFW market. That has been – as good as our network has been in
the state, I think we might have been number three before, two or three. We were probably four or so maybe five-
ish in terms of ATM network in DFW, particularly Dallas. And this really takes that barrier to entry off the table and
I think puts us in a really strong position as we move forward in that market beginning in January.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So what are you seeing in terms of wage pressure right now? And what are you seeing in terms of – there seems
to be a war for talent out there. So I'm just wondering what you guys are experiencing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
We are experiencing it. I keep going back to this conversation I had with our Director of HR. This has been at
least a month ago now but she came in and we were talking about cellphone customer service operators. I think
she said we've got about 50 applications a week, typically, for that position. And I think she said that as of last
week, we got three. This shows you how much competition there is not just from other businesses but at that
point in time, there was the government benefits, which were also frankly a competitive factor.
So we're seeing from our customers, everyone we talk to talks about wage pressure and talk about the inability to
hire people. And that's on top of the supply chain issues that are out there. So we're experiencing it. It's a little bit
worse in some markets but it's bad in all of them, maybe a little bit worse in Dallas and Austin. But, again, it's bad
in all of them. So it's tough.

Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, cash as a percentage of average earning assets just keeps going up for you guys. I mean, it's now 31%. And I
know earlier this year, we had talked about Frost potentially using some of that cash to deploy into the bond book.
But as we've seen, the long-end of the curve has gone down here. So maybe just updated thoughts on when you
feel is the right time to start putting some of that cash to work in a higher earning asset?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Brady, I think we've been pretty consistent. What we said last quarter was that our plan wasn't to make any major
purchases until late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter. That's still, currently, our expectations.
Obviously, we'll keep an eye on the market and we do every day. It's something we're talking about all the time
but we did some purchases at municipals as I mentioned during the quarter.
We were somewhat opportunistic though as yields had been coming down and we saw the ability to get in there
early, so we did accelerate a couple of hundred million of purchases there. But at this point, we're more focused
on late into the third. And I'm really thinking early in the fourth as we begin to see the deferred fees associated
with [ph] PPP (00:28:06) start coming off the books.
As we said, they're accelerated in there. We saw a big chunk of them this quarter and they'll continue pay-off
through the rest of this year. So that's our current thought process. Obviously, we'll keep an eye on the market if
something comes up. If we have an opportunity, we'll jump in. Did we like the market, the yields 45 days ago
better than we do today, most certainly.
But I think given what we see and our expectations, we still believe that inflation is out there. It's not just
temporary, sort of, conversation that's going on. It's still mentioned even on the salary side that we talk about. So
we're being consistent at this point. I haven't seen anything that's made us change our thought process too much.
But again we'll be conscious of when it's time to pull the trigger as to what it makes sense to do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. And then, what do you think about the magnitude of these purchases? As you mentioned, your bond
book is around $12 billion. How much growth could we see beginning this year and into next year? Is it going to
be significant or is it just going to be modest?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
Well, you mentioned, kind of, looking at cash as a percent of earning assets and even cash as a percentage of
total assets. And obviously, we're way above any level that we've been here within the recent past. So you know
us and you followed us for a long time. We're pretty conservative and have been on the amount of balances that
we typically have at the Fed. But given the fact that I think this morning we had $14 billion in balances there, we're
looking to make significant purchases. It's not going to be all at once, obviously, but the thought process today is
that we would utilize a significant amount of that liquidity in 2021 and into 2022 as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then my last question just on the deposit side, your deposit growth has been amazing. You had 27%
last year. First half of this year, you're still at over at 20% annualized pace. Do you think that eventually some of
these deposits will move back out of the bank? How do you think about sustaining all of this notable deposit
growth we've seen over the last year or so?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. It was a – I have to admit, I was amazed looking even at the linked-quarter growth. If you look at it
annualized, it was even stronger than the year-ago growth. I think Phil talked a lot about our focus on new
relationships, and we continue to do well when we look at our 12-month rolling average of what's going on with
our deposit base.
We still see, obviously, that augmentation of our existing customers is, I think, something north of 70%, say 72%.
But we're still getting growth from new customers about 28%, which is still a good chunk. But what we've also
seen is we're seeing a lot of our larger commercial accounts increasing their deposit balances as well and it's
been at some of the higher level.
I think that given the rate environment that we're in right now, given what you're seeing out there as far as
investment is concerned, I think it's really hard to gauge when we might see those deposits leave. At this point,
we continue to feel like the deposit level that we saw through the end of the second quarter, it was pretty
consistent in July, that sort of level growth. So we haven't really seen any sort of runoff.
In our projections right now, don't really have us growing a lot more from here and a lot of it is really more due to
the uncertainty as you said. So, I think we've been really impressed with where we're at and the growth that we've
seen both from existing customers and from our new relationships. But you're right, there's still a lot of uncertainty
out there, a lot of liquidity out there. And hopefully as some of the economy starts to take off, you'd expect that
some of those dollars, both on the consumer side and on the commercial side will probably be spent and probably
would be a good sign for the economy and for what's going on. But at this point, we're not projecting it to go much
from here. But I haven't seen any indication as of today that would indicate they're moving.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. I don't what happened before. First, I just want to drill down a little further into the commentary around
deposits. If you guys look at the non-PPP loans you said trended nice up in June and up so far in July, for those
customers that are starting to draw their lines on the commercial side, are they working their deposits down at all
first or are they just concurrently bringing deposits to you and then also drawing on their lines further?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, Steve. That's a good question. It just depends. I see so many anecdotal stories. I talked to customers
who've just had game-changing experiences with PPP or with grants. I mean, complete reduction of debt on
balance sheets. We've all got stories that we see there. So there and I think one thing that we're seeing is we've
got – probably, we've got C&I opportunities but we've got a fair amount of CRE opportunities. The CRE is
probably a different deal than the scenario you described. I think what you're talking about is mainly C&I, regular
C&I lending.
So and it's just hard to pinpoint a dramatic trend either way. I just think it depends on the business. A lot of
businesses just didn't get any PPP funds. So they're really been dependent upon what they're seeing in the
economy or in the C&I activity, now they're willing to expand. So I think that's probably driving most of that same
time as I said. There've been some really game changing balance sheet changes that have happened for some
companies with regard to their liquidity and debt loads and also I wish I had a good answer for you. I just don't
know.

Yeah. A bit perplexing but okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Steven, the one thing I will say is early on and you're probably aware of this a lot of us were saying that
when PPP first started last year, the deposits – the loans would be made and the deposits would stay, right. The
money wasn't spent immediately. And so a lot of the conversation was around the inflation and the deposits, if you
will, were just the fact that that customers got a PPP loan and then just park the money. And we're not really
seeing that being the case. We've seen movement of most of those. And again, you can't tag that specific PPP
loan to a deposit and then just stay, be able to follow it completely. But when we look at the activity within those
11

accounts, really it looks like those dollars were spent. So it doesn't look like we are in that same situation that we
were at say 9 to 12 months ago.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got you. Okay. And then I wanted to drill down on the 13,500 new net checking accounts you opened in the
quarter. What's the base? In other words, what's the growth rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. So if you look at our customer growth, overall, that's about a 6.2% annualized growth. And I'm thinking it's
round numbers, 400,000 – 400,000, 500,000. But we could divide that. But I mean that's – I mean to – that to me
is amazing, honestly. I mean we've had – we have had goals to grow that number. I think our goal was to maybe
get the 4% one day because you're talking about a large base there. And for us to be at over 6% now on the
entire base, I mean I'm just – I'm really excited about that and that's not an accident. That can't be an accident.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So what portion of those are coming through digital channels versus the traditional branch and does it very much
in use than just given your opening new branches there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I'm thinking that 35-ish percent comes through digital. But I saw that number two hours ago and I just don't
have it here handy. But a significant amount – hang on, maybe I got it. I would say about 30-ishpercent in round
numbers. It looks like not a bad number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess just – just wanted to clarify. Jerry, around your PPP numbers, you mentioned about $45 million, I think, in
the second quarter, $30 million in 1Q. That implies an NII of about $235 million quarterly for the first half. Just
wondering, it sounds like you're managing the securities book with an eye on the NII outlook. Is that [indiscernible]
(00:38:13) ex-PPP around $235 million the right way to think about where you might be in the back half of the
year and where you would look to grow from as you look to redeploy cash into securities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I do think that it looks like, the NIM percentage might've hit the floor there. But again, a lot of it's going to be
dependent on if and when we pull the trigger on the investment portfolio purchases as you said. So, that's
obviously a big driver of it. So, and again, that's the level of deposits. We really don't know what's happened.
The level of growth that we've had is really been a lot more obviously than we expected. And keeping that liquidity
at the Fed has really had a downward pressure on that NIM percentage. So, it's going to be dependent on those
things, you're right. But I think at this point, I think you're thinking about it, right? We, kind of, feel like we're at the
bottom of that. It was nice to see the loan yields up a little bit even on a linked quarter basis even ex-PPP.
But I'm going to tell you that there's a lot of pricing pressure, a lot of competition there. And obviously, we've said
and we continue to say, we're relationship bank and we don't want to lose relationships for a few basis points. So
we're really saying that we want to be competitive there. So we could feel a little bit of pressure there. We'll
continue to feel pressure there. I shouldn't say that we won't because we will. And it's going to continue from
everything that I hear. So we'll feel some pressure on that loan yield. But I think, knock on wood – given all things
being equal, I think we may have hit bottom there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:39:52) cash deployment into securities, is that more a function of the interest rate goal? Or is it
a function of how quickly PPP runs off? Like what's the bigger driver of your thought process [indiscernible]
(00:40:04) the cash?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No. It's not really related to the PPP runoff. I mean obviously we're aware of it. So it's not like we can look in our
financials and not realize it. But, no, that's not really – not going to be the thing that pulls the trigger. I mean we'd
already been talking about before the acceleration of the forgiveness that we were talking – I think Phil mentioned
in the call last quarter that we were talking about late third, most likely early fourth. So again, we don't like the
market. We have the right to not pull the trigger if we don't think it's where we want to be but where we're headed.
I mean that's the thought process at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And I guess just a separate question. Phil, you have talked about this in the past. You introduced
the Early Payday, the $100 grace period on deposits. Just talk to us in terms of the retail side of the bank. You
shared some [indiscernible] (00:41:01). What are you seeing in terms of customer behavior [indiscernible]
(00:41:05) about acquiring [ph] plans (00:41:07). And of the 13,000 checking accounts that you talked about, what
13

percentage are truly translating into customer, where you see them as being [indiscernible] (00:41:18) to ones
where you might [indiscernible] (00:41:20) on the road. Just talk to us in terms of how many of these 13,500
account [indiscernible] (00:41:29) relationship for Frost?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Okay. Ebrahim, you're breaking up. I apologize a bit but let me answer what I think I heard your question. Of the
13,500, I think you ask about accounts how many relationships with Frost. Just one point of clarification, those are
not accounts, those are new relationships. So – and we don't count it a relationship unless we get a checking
account, okay. So these are not – we could go on and advertise higher rates on CDs or higher rates on money
market deposit accounts and bring in a bunch of rate shoppers or whatever. These are relationships.
The account number is consistent. So I really believe that all these represent solid relationships from us. And
another thing we keep an eye on, you have to keep an eye on is what is attrition look like. And our attrition year-
over-year has been really good. I think our closed accounts were up only 0.5% year-over-year quarter in the
second quarter. So we're doing a good job there. I mean, and when you look at the value proposition, I mean,
we've got a really great comparison with our new overdraft raise and with our – you know, the early payday. And
another thing to keep in mind is about 70% of our customers were the primary relationship where we have their
direct deposit.
So I think that also speaks well of what our – how sticky and how deep these relationships are. But I apologize.
Again, there was some breakup when you were asking the question. If I've missed something, please guide me to
where I should be going.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

Great. Thank you. Just want to clarify really quick in terms of the 3% expense growth. Is the base that you're

wondering...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then in terms of provision expense, obviously, a couple of quarters in a row, zero. Is it
fair to assume that you're going to try to stay at zero on a go-forward basis or – I know other banks have
obviously been releasing a lot more reserves based on their CECL model, but there's also some subjectivity to
CECL modeling? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Right. Yeah. I think you're right. At this point, we haven't recorded any provision for the year, and a big part of us
– of our allowance calculation need, if you will, is associated with the overlays, right. Because the models itself
and we'll release our 10-Q this afternoon and we gave quite a bit of detail on how that CECL worked.
The models did actually recalculate, if you will, lower reserve requirement. But what we've said is given all the
uncertainty that we continue to see associated with the pandemic and the effects it has on certain parts of the
economy and again given all the uncertainty that we've seen here recently with the variant, we feel that it really
was not the time to release any reserves. We obviously feel real comfortable about our reserve coverage but
thought there was too much uncertainty in the market for us to release reserves.
At the end of the day, we got to look at it every quarter and see where we're at. I know there are some thoughts
that the September-October timeframe will be interesting given that you've got a lot of employers requiring or
requesting employees to get back to work after Labor Day. You'll have the kids back in school. Obviously, the
variant conversation that's going on currently is starting to highlight other issues with the mask again.
So, we think that come September-October, I think it'll be interesting to see where we're at. I don't expect and
maybe this is a given, I don't expect this to have provisions for the rest of the year given where we're at. But as far
as any discussion about would we be releasing reserves that really be dependent on what we're seeing at the end
of the third quarter, at the end of the fourth quarter. Right now, I think there was just too much uncertainty given
what we were seeing to release reserves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. That makes sense. And I certainly understand the variability around the Delta variant. But just, I guess, if
the economy does get better, let's say, the Moody's models get better in 3Q but there is still that concern. I mean
do you have enough flexibility that you can continue to add to the qualitative reserves like for the next couple
quarters? I'm just wondering if there's a limit to where you're unable to just to keep adding qualitative if that make
sense?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I know it does. And obviously, the thought process there is I think my take on it would be the more – the
bigger percentage of your allowance that is related to overlays of qualitative factors, the more quantitative, those
qualitative factors will have to be if that makes sense. I'm not going to be at a point where I can say the – and it
would never be the case but like have an extreme where the models would say I needed $10 million, let's say,
and I had a $90 million overlay to get you a $100 million reserve. That's never going to be the case.
And so again I think given where we're at, I think our overlay you'll see what's significant compared to the models
this quarter. We feel comfortable with that. But I think to answer that question is could we not or could we grow
our qualitative reserve as a percentage of the total allowance for the rest of the quarters? I think that's a difficult
15


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
question to answer. If we did, let's say, we got to that point. I think what you'd find is that the support for that
would be a lot more quantitative in nature even if it's a qualitative adjustment if that makes sense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey, good afternoon, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey, Dave.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey, back on your expense guide, it seems like that would imply a pretty decent step up in the expense run rate in
the back half of the year. Maybe to that 2.25% level quarterly, just to hit that 3% roughly. Any color as to what
lines you're expecting will drive that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. Well, I'll just talk about a couple of things there. We've really – I think I have said this last time and we were
having a meeting with the head of our marketing group. We've really been light for the first half of the year on
marketing expenses. So, we are projecting a pretty big increase in marketing-related expenses especially in the
fourth quarter. So, that's going to take a big bite out of that increase.
In addition to that, we're going to have additional expenses with that Houston expansion in the second half
because as we've got more and more settle there, you'll see that rise. And as we've talked about, we're going to
do future expansion there. And also the Dallas expansion, we'll see a little bit of that. You won't see a lot but it's
going to run through our numbers here.
We also have incentives that get paid in the fourth quarter that are one-time [ph] hedge (00:50:06) or discrete to
that quarter. So, that's also going to affect the line items there. Phil mentioned some salary pressures. We
continue to have that. And then also, really we've got open positions that we're trying to fill. There are a lot of
requests for – a lot of desire for some talent that's not that easy to find. And so we're projecting that we can fill
those positions but it's taking us longer to do that than we had expected.
16

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 29-Jul-2021
And so – and then generally, I think just in the other expense category, it's been a little bit slower starting out the
year. I think now that we started cranking up and people are in the office and we're starting to visit with customers
again, you'll see just an increase, if you will, in this general sort of meals and entertainment sort of category of
items than we've had in the first half of the year.
I will say that we continue to focus on expenses. I mean to tell you if we are able to beat that 3% growth I'm going
to be happy about it. But at this point, given what I'm seeing that's what it looks like right now. And there's some
specific things like I mentioned that I can put my finger on that are going to drive that increase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay, great. Appreciate all the color there. Maybe just switching to the margin, you mentioned loan pricing
pressure a bit on the call. Was just curious what the front book, back book differential is now, on new loan yields
versus the roll off rate at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
What I saw was 28 basis points on the weighted for commercial portfolio, decreased on the new business in the
quarter versus the back book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. And then you guys mentioned still feeling comfortable about making the securities purchases a few months
from now. I was just wondering if the curves at that point looks like it does today, are you still okay with that and
would you still plan to accelerate those purchases?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
It's hard to say – I think everybody hates this market and a few people understand what the tenure is doing when
inflation is growing like gangbusters and it continues to go down. So I mean, we'll do all we have to do. I mean,
we sit for a long time really all year long that we look at the late third, fourth quarter to be when we thought we'd
be pulling the trigger on this stuff. Obviously, we thought rates would be higher that point in time and inflation
would have reared its head and the market would have responded well, half of that happened. Inflation is reared
more than its head and the market has really responded on it.
We also said during that time that we might miss the peak and we have at least at this point, but then we're still
going from 10 or 15 basis points to 125 basis points or 175 basis points. So there's still a lot of operating leverage
that we'll bring to the party when we decide to do it. But I would love to see – clearly, there's been volatility in the
market as relates to yields. We've got some time based on our timeframe to see that play out in the marketplace.
I'd love to see some variability happen and be able to take advantage of some of it on the high side. We'll see. I
know that's not definitive, but no one's got the answer to that question right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Right. Great. And maybe one last on capital, those ratios continue to grow. Just in general CET1 ratio is inching
up to 14%. How do you think about that? Do you expect those to continue to grow from here? Are you thinking
about buying back some shares to stabilize that? Any thoughts there would be great.

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
We've said repeatedly and you saw us increase our dividend this quarter. Our focus is really on ensuring we can
pay that dividend. That's what our primary focus is on. I'm sure you saw on our balance sheet that and we talked
about earlier in the call, I mean, assets are going like crazy given all the deposit growth that we're seeing. And if
you look at our leverage ratio, we're probably a little low compared to peers. And we've been coming down there.
So we keep an eye on that. So, really, Dave, right now, I'd say that we're more focused on ensuring that we pay
the dividend more than we are on the stock buyback.
