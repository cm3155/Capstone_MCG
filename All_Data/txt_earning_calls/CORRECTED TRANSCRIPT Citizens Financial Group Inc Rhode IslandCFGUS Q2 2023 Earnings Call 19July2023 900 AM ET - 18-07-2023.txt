Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Second Quarter 2023
Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alan, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a
listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder,
this event is being recorded.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may
begin.

Kristin Silberberg
Head-Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
First this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods will provide an overview of
our second quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of
Commercial Banking are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our second quarter earnings
presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions.
Our comments today will include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may
cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page 2 of the
presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures. So, it's important to review our GAAP results on
page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix.
And with that, I'll hand over to you, Bruce.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today.
The turbulent external environment continued in the second quarter, but we continue to navigate well and we
delivered solid financial performance. In particular, we're pleased with the strong results we achieved around
capital, liquidity and funding. Our CET1 ratio grew by 30 basis points to 10.3% in the quarter, and we were able to
repurchase in excess of $250 million in stock. We grew spot deposits by 3% or $5.5 billion, and our spot loan to
deposit ratio improved to 85%. Our Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings dropped by $7 billion to $5 billion, and
contingent liquidity grew by 20% to $79 billion.
For the quarter, we posted underlying earnings per share of $1.04 and ROTCE of 13.9%. NII was down 3%,
reflecting higher funding costs in line with our expectations. Noninterest income grew 4%, slightly less than
expected as capital markets saw a few deals pushed to the third quarter. Expenses were broadly stable as
expected, and credit costs continue to be manageable.
One of the highlights of the second quarter was the opportunity to secure a significant influx of talent, largely from
the First Republic platform to meaningfully augment our Citizens Private Bank and wealth management business.
While expense investments will lead revenues in 2023, we project the business to be accretive in 2024 and

significantly profitable in the medium term. In our presentation this morning, we will highlight this initiative in more
detail. And we'll also review several other compelling initiatives that we believe will lead to strong medium-term
outperformance. Execution of these initiatives continues to be strong.
We're setting up a non-core run-off portfolio as a centerpiece of intensified balance sheet optimization efforts. We
expect around $9 billion of loan run-off, largely in auto, by the end of 2025. This capacity will be utilized to fund
more strategic loan portfolios, to pay down high-cost debt, and to build cash and securities. In parallel, the Private
Bank will grow loans over this period by $9 billion, which will be funded by $11 billion of incremental deposits. The
net benefit of all of this is a better deployment of capital, along with positive impact on earnings per share,
ROTCE and liquidity.
We've also included more detail on our CRE loan portfolio. Our general office reserve is now at 8%. While we
continue to see increases in criticized assets and charge-offs in this particular portfolio, we believe losses are
manageable and readily absorbed by reserves and our strong capital position.
Looking forward, we anticipate that the environment, while stabilizing, will continue to be challenging. Our net
interest margin will decline again in Q3, given higher funding costs. We expect our terminal beta to reach 49% to
50% at year-end. Our fees continue to grow sequentially. Expenses will be well controlled and credit should be
broadly stable. We will further build our CET1 ratio, while continuing to repurchase shares.
Overall, we're holding in okay on current period performance with mid-teens ROTCE in 2023, while making the
investments to deliver a stronger franchise, attractive growth and returns and a fortified balance sheet over the
medium term. We continue to build a great bank and we remain very excited about our future. Our capital strength
and our attractive franchise position us to attract terrific talent and to take advantage of opportunities as they
arise.
With that, let me turn it over to John to take you through more of the financial details. John?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone.
Let me start with the headlines for the second quarter referencing slide 5. For the second quarter, we generated
underlying net income of $531 million and EPS of $1.04. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 13.9%. Net
interest income was down 3% linked quarter and our margin was 3.17%, down 13 basis points with funding costs
outpacing the increase in asset yields. We delivered very strong deposit growth in the quarter, reflecting the
strength of the franchise, with spot deposits up 3% or $5.5 billion. Period-end loans and average loans were down
2% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the impact of our balance sheet optimization efforts, including our ongoing run-
off of auto. These dynamics improved our period-end LDR to 85% and our liquidity position remains very strong.
We reduced FHLB borrowings by about $7 billion to approximately $5 billion outstanding at quarter-end. And we
increased our available liquidity by 19% to about $79 billion.
Our credit maximum and overall position remain solid. Total NCOs of 40 basis points are up 6 basis points linked
quarter as expected, primarily reflecting higher charge-offs in CRE general office. We recorded a provision for
credit losses of $176 million and a reserve build of $24 million this quarter, increasing our ACL coverage to
1.52%, up from 1.47% at the end of the first quarter with the increase directed to the general office portfolio. We
repurchased $256 million of common shares in the second quarter and delivered a strong CET1 ratio of 10.3%,

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
up from 10% in the first quarter. And our tangible book value per share is down 2% linked quarter, reflecting AOCI
impacts associated with higher rates.
On the next few slides, I'll provide further details related to second quarter results. On slide 6, net interest income
was down 3%, primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin, which was down 13 basis points to 3.17% with the
increase in asset yields more than offset by higher funding costs, given the competitive environment and
migration from lower-cost categories. With Fed funds increasing 500 basis points since the end of 2021, our
cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta is 42% through the second quarter, which has been rising in response to
the rate and competitive environment and is generally in the pack with peers. Our asset sensitivity at the end of
the second quarter is still approximately 1%, which is broadly stable with the prior quarter. Our receive fixed cash
flow swap position is similar to the prior quarter as we held off on adding further protection as rates continued to
rise during the quarter.
Moving on to slide 7, we posted solid fee performance in a challenging market environment. Fees were up 4%
linked quarter, the card fees showing a seasonally strong increase from higher transaction volumes and increases
in wealth and mortgage banking fees. FX and derivatives revenue was modestly lower. Capital markets fees were
stable, with market volatility through the quarter continuing to impact underwriting fees, largely offset by increased
syndications and M&A advisory fees, despite a few deals being pushed into the third quarter. We continue to see
good strength in our deal pipelines and are hopeful that deal flow picks up in the second half. Mortgage fees were
slightly higher as production fees increased with market volumes, partially offset by lower margins and lower
servicing fees. And finally, wealth fees were also up slightly, reflecting growth in AUM.
On slide 8, expenses were broadly stable linked quarter as seasonally lower salaries and employee benefits were
offset by higher equipment and software costs, as well as higher advertising and deposit insurance costs.
On slide 9, average and period-end loans were both down 2% linked quarter reflecting balance sheet optimization
actions in C&I, as well as the impact of planned auto run-off. Education was lower given the rate environment, but
this was offset by modest growth in mortgage and home equity. Commercial utilization was down a bit as clients
looked to de-leverage given higher rates, and we saw less M&A financing activity in the face of an uncertain
economic environment.
On slide 10, period-end deposits were up $5.5 billion or 3% linked quarter with growth led by Consumer up $3
billion and Commercial up $2 billion. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 47 basis points, which translates
to a 101% sequential beta and a 42% cumulative beta. Strong deposit flows and a very successful auto loan
collateralized borrowing program initiated during the quarter contributed to reducing FHLB levels by about $7
billion. Given our BSO objectives, we grew deposits which drove a favorable mix shift away from wholesale
funding. As a result, our total cost of funds was relatively well-behaved, up 38 basis points.
Next, I'll move to slide 11 to highlight the strength of our deposit franchise. With 67% of our deposits skewed
toward Consumer and highly diversified across product mix and channels, we are able to efficiently and cost-
effectively manage our deposits in a rising rate environment. We increased the portion of our insured and secured
deposits from 68% to 70% linked quarter. And when combined with our available liquidity of $79 billion, our
available liquidity as a percentage of uninsured deposits increased to about 150% from around 120% in the first
quarter. As rates rose another 25 basis points in the second quarter, we saw continued migration of lower-cost
deposits to higher-yielding categories, primarily in Commercial with noninterest-bearing now representing about
23% of the book. This is back to pre-pandemic levels and should stabilize from here.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Moving on to slide 12, we saw good credit results in retail again this quarter and higher charge-offs in
Commercial. Net charge-offs were 40 basis points, up 6 basis points linked quarter, which reflects an increase in
the general office segment of commercial real estate, partly offset by a slight improvement in retail primarily due
to the strength in used car values. Nonperforming loans are 79 basis points of total loans, up 15 basis points from
the first quarter, reflecting an increase in general office, which tends to be lumpy. It's also worth noting that overall
delinquencies were lower sequentially with retail and Commercial both improving slightly. Retail delinquencies
continue to remain favorable to historical levels.
Turning to slide 13, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We increased our allowance by $24
million, which includes a $41 million increase in CRE general office even after covering charge-offs of $56 million.
Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.52%, which is a 5-basis-point increase in the second quarter. The run-off of
the non-core portfolio, primarily auto, facilitated the reallocation of reserves to CRE. The reserve coverage in
general office was increased to a strong 8%.
On slide 14, you'll see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level, which we
feel represent a fairly adverse scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns. As
mentioned, we built our reserve for the general office portfolio to $313 million this quarter, which represents
coverage of 8%.
In addition to running a number of stress scenarios across the general office portfolio, we continuously perform a
detailed loan-level analysis that takes into account property-specific details such as location, building quality,
operating performance and maturity. We have a very experienced CRE team who are focused on managing the
portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis and engaging in ongoing discussions with sponsors to work through the property
and borrower-specific elements to de-risk the portfolio and ultimately minimize losses. Our reserves reflect this
detailed view of the portfolio, as well as the key macro factors we set out on the page.
The property value, default rate and loss severity assumptions we are using to set the reserve are adequate for
the risks we currently see and are significantly more conservative than what we see in previous CRE downturns.
It's worth noting that the financial impact of any further deterioration beyond what we expect would be very
manageable given our strong reserve and capital position.
On the following slide 15, there are some additional disclosures we are providing this quarter to give more detail
on the type and location of the general office portfolio. You can see out of the $3.9 billion general office portfolio,
94% is Class A or B with a majority in suburban areas, which seem to be performing better than central business
districts.
On the bottom left-hand side of the page, it highlights that the portfolio is quite diversified across geographies, as
well as the top 10 MSAs listed on the bottom right-hand side. Broadly, for New York MSA, we are starting to see
return-to-office trends picking up, and more than 80% of the portfolio is outside Manhattan, where property
dynamics tend to be more favorable. Washington, D.C. is 100% Class A and B and 95% suburban.
Moving to slide 16, we maintain excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.3% as we look
to add capital given the uncertain macro and regulatory environment. We returned a total of $461 million to
shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Turning to slide 17, you'll see that our CET1 ratio is among the highest in our regional bank peer group. This
strong capital level reflects a relatively conservative approach since the IPO in maintaining robust capital levels. If
you incorporate the removal of AOCI opt-out, our adjusted CET1 ratio would be 8.5%, and we also expect that
6

(CFG) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
this would place us near the top of our peer group again this quarter. We expect to maintain very strong capital
levels going forward with the ability to generate roughly 20 basis points of CET1 ratio post dividend each quarter
in 2H 2023 before share buybacks.
So, as you see, we've been focused for a while on playing really strong defense with a focus on capital, liquidity,
funding and maintaining a prudent credit risk appetite. And that's been job one even long before the turmoil we
saw in the first quarter. But we also recognize the need to continue to play offense. We need to be selective,
investing in initiatives that will grow the franchise where we have a right to win. Over the next few slides, I'll
spotlight a few of the exciting things we are doing to make sure that we can deliver growth and strong returns for
our shareholders.
First, on slides 19 and 20, we were excited to announce a few weeks back that we have hired about 50 senior
private bankers and 100 related support professionals who were with First Republic. As many of you know, for a
number of years, we've had an interest in growing our wealth business both organically and inorganically. So, we
made a number of investments on the organic side, hiring financial advisors and converting that business from a
transactional business to a very customer-centric financial planning approach that's going to slow and steady
build over the years. And then we supplemented that with the Clarfeld acquisition a couple of years ago, and
that's gone incredibly well.
So, with our customer-centric culture, our financial strength and the full range of products and services we offer,
we were the perfect fit for these bankers. We really admire their approach to delivering the bank and their
customers in a unique way with white-glove service. This is really a coast-to-coast team with a presence in some
of our key markets like New York, Boston, and places where we'd like to do more like Florida and California. In
fact, we think the overlap with JMP in San Francisco is extremely complementary. These bankers serve the types
of customers we are seeking to attract to the bank, high and ultra-high net worth individuals and families, often
with strong connections to middle market companies with a particular focus on private equity and venture capital
firms serving the innovation economy.
We have a great deal of work ahead of us to integrate these teams and to ensure that they are positioned to
deliver the bank and their clients. We plan to open a few private banking centers in key geographies and build
appropriate scale in our wealth business with Clarfeld as the centerpiece of that effort. We think this is going to be
extremely attractive from a financial perspective. These teams and their staff, about 150 people in total, on-
boarded late in the second quarter with revenue beginning to ramp in the fourth quarter.
Financial impact for the second half will be $0.08 to $0.10 of EPS, plus an initial notable cost of about $0.03 for
2023. These bankers have hit the ground running and are out working to build their book of business and we
expect the effort to break even around the middle of 2024. By 2025, we expect EPS accretion of roughly 5% with
2025 year-end projections of about $9 billion in loans, $11 billion of deposits and $10 billion of assets under
management. So, overall, a very exciting advance for us.
Now, let's go to slide 21 and I'll walk you through how we'll be managing our balance sheet over the next few
years. Since the IPO, we've prudently grown our balance sheet while managing the mix of assets and funding
with an eye towards maximizing returns. With the increase in rates since the end of 2021, plus the advent of
quantitative tightening and more recently, the heightened competition for deposits, we are entering the next stage
of the journey with a plan to focus on attractive relationship lending while lowering our LDR, which will improve
our liquidity profile and benefit returns.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
In order to make this effort clear and show the benefits we expect, we've established a $14 billion non-core
portfolio, which is comprised of our $10 billion shorter duration indirect auto portfolio and lower relationship
purchased consumer loans. This portfolio will rundown fairly quickly with about $9 billion of run-off expected by
the end of 2025.
Moving to slide 22 and 23, you'll see that as the non-core loan portfolio runs down, this allows us to pay down
higher-cost funding and redeploy capital into more strategic lending and our investment portfolio. We will also be
growing relationship-based lending through the Private Bank and raising deposits to self-fund that growth. Despite
the size of the run-off portfolio, we expect to see modest loan growth in 2024, picking up in 2025, driven by
opportunities across retail and C&I, as well as our Private Bank effort. The net result of these actions is an
improved liquidity profile with a better loan and funding mix and higher returns.
Next on slide 24, a quick update on our entry into New York Metro, where some really exciting things are
happening. With the branch conversions behind us, we have full steam ahead working to serve our customers
and capitalize on opportunities. We continue to be encouraged by our early success. We've seen strong sales in
the branches as we leverage our full customer service capabilities to drive some of the highest customer
acquisition and sales rates in our network. Most importantly, we've seen a steady improvement in our Net
Promoter Scores.
On the Commercial Banking side, we've got a strong new leadership team in place with local talent joining from
larger firms, and we are seeing some early success leveraging our new visibility to build pipelines for middle
market firms. And we are looking forward to what we can do with our new private banking capabilities in the
market.
On slide 25, we have a great opportunity to build on Citizens Access, our national digital platform that has been
focused on deposits for the last few years. We've moved to a modern, fully cloud-based core platform and we
plan to add checking capabilities later this year. Down the road, we plan to converge our legacy core system with
this modern platform. We are confident that a single integrated platform will be more cost efficient and flexible in
meeting our clients' needs. We aim for this to be a complete digital bank experience to serve customers
nationwide with a focus on the young, mass affluent market segment.
And on the right side of the page is Citizens Pay, where we have been very innovative in creating distinctive ways
to serve customers. Citizens Pay has been the top customer acquisition engine for the bank with very high
Promoter Scores, and it has been a great performer from a credit perspective. We've had some fantastic partners
on the platform for a while, such as Apple, Microsoft, Best Buy, BJ's and Vivint. And we are always very excited to
welcome new partners like Peloton, Trek, The Tile Shop and Wisetack to the platform.
On slide 26, I'll highlight how we are positioned to support the significant growth in private capital. Over the last
several years, private capital fundraising has led to record deal formation, M&A activity and substantial fees. Deal
activity has been relatively muted recently, and many sponsors have not deployed meaningful amounts of capital.
So, there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for M&A and capital markets activity. We have been
executing a consistent strategy to serve the sponsor community with distinctive capabilities for the last 10 years.
And we've done a great job moving up to the top of the sponsor league tables, particularly in the middle market.
We've made significant investments in talent and capabilities, including five advisory acquisitions since 2017, and
our new private bankers significantly expand our sponsor relationships and capabilities. Our success supporting
private capital has been a large part of our strong capital markets performance over the last few years, and we
are poised to capitalize on the next wave of sponsor activity as the path of the economy becomes clearer.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Let's move to slide 27 for an update on our TOP program. Our latest TOP 8 program is well underway and
progressing well. Given the external environment, we have decided to augment the program to protect returns, as
well as ensure that we can continue to make the important investments in our business to drive future
performance. We have increased our targeted benefit by $15 million to $115 million by accelerating some of our
efforts to further rationalize our branch network and reduce procurement costs. We have also begun planning for
a TOP 9 program, looking for efficiency opportunities driven by further automation and use of AI to better serve
our customers. We are also looking at ways to simplify our organization and find even more savings in
procurement. Continuous improvement is part of our DNA, and I'm very confident that we'll continue to deliver
these benefits to the bank.
Moving to slide 28, I'll walk through the outlook for the second quarter for Citizens, which excludes the impact of
the Private Bank, and I will also provide some comments for the full year. The outlook takes into account another
rate increase followed by Fed on hold through the remainder of this year. For the third quarter, we expect NII to
decrease about 4%, noninterest income to be up by approximately 3%, noninterest expense should be broadly
stable. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable to up slightly. Our CET1 is expected to rise modestly
from 10.3% with additional share repurchases planned, which will depend upon our ongoing assessment of the
external environment.
Relating to the full year, our liquidity position is quite strong and given the BSO actions I discussed earlier, we will
continue to build on this targeting an LDR of low-to-mid 80s by the end of the year, positioning us well for
anticipated regulatory changes. Worth noting, we already are fully LDR compliant with Category 3 bank
requirements. Based on the forward curve, we are expecting a terminal interest-bearing deposit beta of 49% to
50%. Our net interest margin should begin to stabilize in Q4 as the Fed is expected to reach the end of the rate
hike cycle. We are off to a great start in building out the Private Bank and we expect the EPS impact of this to be
$0.06 in the third quarter and $0.02 to $0.04 in the fourth quarter. So, we really think of this as a capital
investment.
To wrap up, our results were solid for the quarter as we continued to navigate a turbulent external environment.
We are focused on positioning the company with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position, which will serve
us well as we continue to navigate a challenging environment ahead. Our balance sheet strength also positions
us very well to focus on our strategic priorities, to continue to strengthen the franchise for the future and deliver
attractive returns.
With that, I'll hand back over to Bruce.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: And thank you. Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the conference
call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first question is just on the sort of accretion
to the margin from the balance sheet optimization. Do you have a sense for what sort of a steady state margin
from Citizens might look like after that is completed, I guess, doesn't necessarily have to be a specific number, but
just in your view, how powerful is that accretion from these activities? And I appreciate that sort of the backdrop of
the 4.2% yield versus the 5.5% funding cost.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I'll go ahead and start off, Scott. Thanks for the question. I mean, I think broadly, we're seeing the impact of
the rate environment on our net interest margin. We're managing it quite well as the Fed is continuing on its hiking
cycle. And as you get into the end of the year, taking into consideration all of the balance sheet optimization
activities, we see NIM flattening out and kind of holding in around 3% or so as you get to the end of the year. The
tailwinds from balance sheet optimization are meaningful and will continue to build into 2024. And so, those are
the big drivers there. I think that also contributing to that NIM stability would be the fact that we think that balance
sheet migration is starting to stabilize. And also, you can't ignore the fact that the Private Bank itself, as you get
out into 2024, will start to deliver accretive NIM. So, we're feeling good about the profile after we get through this
last hike from the Fed here in July, watching that NIM starts to stabilize as you get into the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then is it possible to put sort of a finer point on the, I guess, $0.08 to $0.10 of
cumulative expected EPS drag from the Private Bank initiatives? Certainly, appreciate sort of the loan and deposit
and asset management – or assets under management outlooks, but maybe any broad sense for dollar value of
expected revenues and expenses as we look into the second half?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, and it's a little bit front-end loaded as the expenses will come in and drive, probably, more in the
neighborhood of $0.06 of that $0.08 to $0.10 happening in the third quarter with the $0.02 to $0.04 really into the
fourth quarter. And it's primarily expenses in the neighborhood of $40 million or so, as you get into the 3Q and 4Q,
but the loan book starts to build later this quarter and into 4Q. So, that gives you the – yeah, the [indiscernible]
(00:31:18) $0.08 to $0.10 into 3Q.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
The one thing I would say to that, Scott – it's Bruce – is this is a very sound approach to scaling up the wealth
business. We've been looking for acquisition ideas and it's been very expensive with very long, tangible book
value earn-backs many times would be over five years, which is beyond our appetite. So, to actually do this in a
10


Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
(CFG) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
kind of a de novo build-up basis, you incur some capital expense in the short run, but it's almost the same as if
you kind of equate it to an outlay that ultimately starts to generate revenues. And the nice thing about this is that
it's accretive already in the second year and the kind of earn-back on this thing is under two years.
So, we look at it really less as a driver of how does it affect the near-term EPS. But, look, there's a – that capital
outlay which we burned some expense dollars to get it off the ground. And then all of a sudden, it's making us
money and it really ramps very nicely and can achieve something like a 5% accretion in 2025, which is kind of
within two and a half years, in the second year of doing a deal. If you compare that to some of the other
transactions that we've done, including the bank acquisitions, it's pretty darn powerful. So, very excited about this
opportunity.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. John, I was just wondering if you could help us with lots of the moving pieces that's sort of
unfurling in front of us. So, just, I guess, the first question is you noted stability at the 3% level. Does that mean
that fourth quarter 2024 will be at about the third quarter level? I'm just wondering sort of how those dynamics
play out in terms of what you expect for the – how the balance sheet trend for the rest of the year or sort of the
run-off continue to pressure it at that level. And what does that fourth quarter NII about look like from a range
perspective?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

...yeah, no, I heard you reference 2024 – but the answer is actually a little bit similar. But what we do see is after
the Fed hikes here in July and that the impact of that get burns in in the third quarter, that we do see NIM
flattening out there between 3Q and 4Q, having a more flat profile as you get into the end of the year, around 3%.
So, maybe a touch higher in 3Q net interest margin, but seeing that profile begin to flatten out, and I think that the
key drivers of that and the pieces and parts, as I mentioned, we're starting to see a deceleration in deposit
migration – a negative deposit migration. So, that's a good early green shoot that's consistent with the fact that
our DDA levels are basically where we were back to pre-pandemic. And so, that ends up being an expected
landing zone as you get into the end of the year.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
So, we'll see that flattening out. You'll see that the tailwinds from the run-off book start to kick in, the reallocation
of that capital and liquidity into relationship lending and the ability to pay down some higher-cost funding as you
get into the end of the year. And so, that starts to bolster net interest margin, which we do think carries into 2024.
And we think that there are a number of positive developments in 2024 that would allow us to hold that NIM out
into even beyond the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And I would comment, Erika, that this was a really important quarter for us to kind of get the deposit level where
we wanted to get the Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings lower and really take a big step in lowering the LDR.
And so, we paid up a little bit to achieve that and the impact of that full quarter effect affects the third quarter
guide. But I think at this point, we feel that we don't need to continue to really aggressively grow deposits. We can
have a more stable deposit profile, which as John indicated, less migration from noninterest-bearing to interest
bearing. And so, there won't be kind of a full quarter impact of an aggressive plan that affects Q4 from Q3
because we'll be kind of looking at a more stable profile in Q3.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And so, thank you for that, Bruce. So, as I think about the fourth quarter, is it fair then to say that your
guidance implies NII of $1.52 billion for the third quarter? So, do we assume that we're at or around that range for
the fourth quarter? And as we think about the puts and takes of 2024, and John, I have to bring this up because a
few investors were noting, I think now it's slide 31 where you have some swaps rolling off that have very heavy
weighted average fixed rate that you're receiving. So, as I think about $1.52 billion perhaps as a starting point plus
or minus, I assume that the – your guide for down 100 basis points NII for full year down 1.2% is still valid if we
assume rate cuts next year and includes the swap roll-off. So, that's sort of the first question.
And the second is how does balance sheet optimization impact that sensitivity. So, I'm assuming that's
extraordinarily static. And I'm assuming that from both sides are paying off more debt next year as you were
waiting for these loans to come on, and then your – as you wait for these loans, you're also putting it in higher-
yielding – in cash. So, if you could just help us think through the moving pieces as it relates to that original
disclosure because I think investors are thinking about the potential for rate cuts next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And maybe I'll just start off in a couple of areas. Just when you think about NII, some of the numbers that you're
throwing out there are probably a little lighter than where we would see them come out. I think our NII will be a
little better than that. And in the fourth quarter, I think we have some opportunities, too, if interest-earning assets
are going to be stabilized, as Bruce indicated, and net interest margin is stabilized. So, we think the NII is also
stabilized at solid levels. So, that was, I think, the first question that you had.
I mean, I think the...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Just to put a point on that, too, is that any swap impacts are in our forward guidance, Erika. So, we've already
contemplated that. So, there's nothing – and they didn't really move. We didn't do any adjustments in the second
quarter.

John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, there's very limited adjustments. Things do roll off and come on. But broadly, our asset sensitivity profile
was pretty stable quarter-over-quarter, meaning we were still asset sensitive. So, a rate rise, which we're about to
get from the Fed, does actually contribute to NII and net interest margin for us. So, from that perspective, all of
that has been built into the commentary that we've been giving you in terms of swap roll-off and our ongoing
positive asset sensitivity.
Again, when you think about net interest margin over kind of the next several quarters, we have a number of
tailwinds. You've got flattening out noninterest-bearing migration, so that's no longer expected to be a big
headwind. You've got the run-off book that we talked about, and that run-off book is going to be rotated into
relationship lending at higher yields. So, the run-off...

Bruce Winfield Van Saun A

Paying off high-cost debt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
...and paying down high-cost funding, right, so that we have a negative kind of spread situation there. We already
mentioned the fact that the Private Bank is going to start contributing to the balance sheet later this year and that
the net interest margin on that is actually accretive to the overall legacy bank.
The other thing I'd throw out there is that, just the front book/back book dynamics where you basically have
originations in the front book. Just in the securities portfolio alone, there's 300 basis points plus positive front
book/back book in terms of them – we're actually creating a bigger securities book, but we're doing it at the right
time where securities yields are actually historically quite favorable. And so, we're putting a lot away from that
standpoint. And we're seeing back into the loan book spreads on our front book originations higher than they
were. And for example, in C&I, spreads are up 50 basis points over the last year, year-over-year. So, that's also a
tailwind. And all of those things are the things that are going to help us manage the fact that – manage the rate
environment and the other items that we have.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
So I think what John described, Erika, is a number of tailwinds that should be positive. So, if the Fed is cutting
next year, that potentially is a negative, but we'd have these positive things to offset that, which gives us kind of
that stable view on the NIM into 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And just to wrap it up, just because I got a few emails to clarify and I'll step aside, it sounds like your
sensitivity hasn't changed. Whatever that fourth quarter number is, which is stable to third quarter, the down 1.2%
on down 100 basis points is still valid, but then the balance sheet optimization will get you closer to stable despite
Fed cuts.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, agreed. So, balance sheet optimization, plus the fact that when if the rates were – rates begin to fall, if they
do, we don't have that happening in the fourth quarter, by the way, we have that happening in 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
We have the Fed on hold for the rest of the year and we have the Fed just based on the forward curve, right,
having the Fed ending around 4% in 2024, so it's really until 2024 where you see those down rate scenarios. And
in the down rate scenario, I mean, that's where deposit betas start working for you rather than against you. And
so, then you start getting some of that coming in, as well as the fixed loan portfolio that creates a buffer when
rates start to fall. And so I would just add those two things to all the other tailwinds I already articulated as to why
we feel like we can hold a stable NIM.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I'd just close and you got an extended period of time here, Erika, and we're very interested in NII and NIM,
which I'm sure is on a lot of investors' minds, but kind of bigger picture as we're kind of transitioning the loan book
to things that are more strategic and offer better returns on capital and better opportunities for cross-sell and
deepening with customers. And so, we're kind of working through a transition period this year and even into next
year. It's a little hard to give you a full guidance at this point, given a lot of uncertainty still in the market. We're
giving you our best instincts at this point on that.
But I feel quite confident that as we kind of emerge through 2024 and then even look out to 2025 that kind of with
the liftoff of this Private Bank effort and the kind of rundown of these less strategic portfolios that we're going to
get a lot of benefit from this. And we're really poised to do quite well, I think, looking out into kind of back half of
2024 into 2025.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Hi, good morning. This is Nate Stein on behalf of Matt O'Connor. Just one question for me. So, the capital build
was good this quarter with the CET1 rising to 10.3% from 10% and guidance calls for this to increase again in 3Q.
Just wanted to ask, how high are you willing to let the ratio get to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
It's Bruce. I think by the end of the year, we could see it getting to 10.5%, which is a bit above our – our stated
range had been 9.5% to 10%. I think given all the uncertainty that's out there in the economy, plus direction of
travel from regulators, that managing it up like that is sensible. Having said that, we're still generating quite good
returns, which gives us the ability to kind of nudge that up from here in terms of the ratio, but also repurchase our
stock, which we think is a great value at the current pricing. So, that's how we're looking at it.
And then as we go through 2024, at this point, our early thoughts would be kind of more of the same that we can
at least hold that 10.5% and maybe build on it based on what we see from regulators. But we have the
wherewithal to be in the market buying our stock on a consistent basis and holding or building that ratio further.

Bruce and John, can you guys share with us – obviously, Vice Chair Barr has come out with a speech last week
talking about RWA increases that will lead to higher capital levels for all banks over $100 billion in assets. Have
you guys given some thought on where you could be most impacted by the new Basel III Endgame rules that
maybe will come out next week?
And then second, as part of this, this week, Bloomberg reported that there may even be some RWA increases for
residential mortgages, which really hasn't been discussed. And how are you guys approaching what could be
coming possibly as soon as next week?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Let me start and I'll quickly flip it to John, but, clearly I would say there's mixed views on whether that's a sound
proposal at this point. And I think the industry itself has acquitted itself very well through the pandemic, through
this period of turmoil in the first half of the year. And I think many folks have commented that the industry has
strong capital. And so, in response to three idiosyncratic bank failures, is it appropriate that the thing that needs to
be fixed is more capital in the banking system. I don't know, it's a question whether that's appropriate and we'll
see how it plays out. I think there'll be lots of dialogue around that.
I think from our standpoint, by moving our capital position higher, we're anticipating any of what could come down
the pike is something that we can absorb. We're in a very strong position relative to our SCB, which, by the way,
we're still have some questions about how this landed where it did. But nonetheless, we're well above that and
we're well above if the AOCI filter goes away, we already have sufficient capital to meet our new proposed SCB.
So, we're in a position of strength, Gerard. I think we can still deliver the kind of returns we aspire to over time as
we get through this transition period and hit our medium-term financial targets. But I would kind of at least
comment that I'm not sure that that's the answer when we had a series of management, supervisory failures and
poor asset and liability management, that really was the problem that caused this turmoil, not a lack of capital in
the banking system.
So, I'll get off my soapbox and I'll pass it over to John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Agree with all of that. And I think the issue is I think credit RWA versus operational risk RWA, Gerard. So, I
think there was a view that there would be some puts and takes on the credit risk RWA and maybe it wouldn't be
much of an increase expected at the regional bank level. But we did see those reports on residential mortgages.
We'll see how it all plays out.
But on the operational risk side of things, with a complex fee-based sort of businesses where a lot of that is
directed, and it's not just we don't have as much of exposure to that as maybe some other banks in the industry
do. So, broadly, we felt like that we would be impacted, possibly, a little less than most. And we're sitting with
capital a little more than most. And so, from that perspective, we feel pretty well positioned for the uncertainty of
the regulatory, rule making process, and as you heard from Bruce, we're growing capital into the end of the year.
And I think something in the neighborhood of 10.5% CET1 is a pretty strong mitigant to anything that might come
down the road from the Fed.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the strategic remixing and wondering, can you give us
some color on the types of loans and deposits that you think will come over as part of those new hires in the
Private Bank, I mean, obviously, the First Republic mix had been kind of low-rate mortgages and high-rate CDs. I
would expect that's not the type of NIM you're looking to be adding. So, just wondering just what those producers
you're expecting to bring over and also kind of we could see it in your AUM expectation, but it looks like it'd be
more NII delivering as opposed to fees.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Turn that over to Brendan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So, yeah, we are really excited, obviously, about this initiative and it's a very strategic acceleration of our
wealth management business. But to your point, it does come with scaling up the bank as well. While we are
aiming to recreate a lot of the customer experience magic that existed in these private banking models, where we
are going to make some structural changes to make sure that the profile of the business that we get is accretive
at the top of the house.
So, what you can expect from us is disciplined credit pricing that while we'll be competitive, we're not going to kind
of lead with undercutting the market in pricing to make sure we have the right margin. We will have incredibly
disciplined credit appetite. We don't expect to take a step forward or step in the wrong direction in terms of credit
risk profile. In fact, we think this will enhance the credit risk profile with very low risk loan generation. We are
going to ensure that we're driving lendable deposits on the balance sheet that we put out relative to the Private
Bank that we're getting core operating deposits, whether that's from individuals or from businesses, it's really
important that we maintain a sound liquidity position in this growth.
And lastly, from a compensation perspective, we're going to – so, rationalize the compensation model best we
can within the confines of a private bank to ensure that both the combination of those factors give us a return
profile that can be accretive at the top of the house on overall ROE, but also on things like NIM.
So, the balance sheet on the deposit side certainly will have a mix of cash management, operating deposits, as
well as interest-bearing. But we are going to tether all relationships to being primary banking, whether it's
corporate or whether it's personal. So, you can expect low-cost DDA to be mixed in with interest-bearing for a
healthy profile primary banking relationships. On the asset side, I'd say we're expecting about a 50-50 mix of what
I would call sort of consumer, personal, retail lending and small business and corporate lending. And on the
personal lending side, really, the large asset classes are going to be mortgage, home equity and eventually
partner loan program where we're putting capital out to individuals to engage as a partner in a higher-end
consulting firm or private equity firm, very traditional low-risk assets that dislodge the operating deposits and
ultimately lead you to AUM.
And on the business side, as was mentioned earlier, the profile of the team we got over does have a bent towards
the innovation economy. So, we're expecting capital call line lending to dislodge operating deposit relationships
with private equity and venture. And a small segment where it's appropriate relationship-wise on a potentially
multifamily in a very high credit environment where we can also secure the personal wealth relationship.
All of our balance sheet usage will be oriented around full end-to-end customer relationships that include deposits
and ultimately AUM growth. So, it's a very integrated end-to-end business model and we feel like we've got the
17

right recreation of the service strategy, married with the right corrections to the business model to ensure we get
better profitability, and also a stable business model that can withstand the test of the time. And we think we can
get really good growth around this, but we will control the growth with a guardrail of adequate profile of the
business that will be healthy and profitable over the long haul.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great color. Thank you, Brendan. And just one more question on the other side of the BSO. John, obviously,
talking a lot about the Consumer side of the non-core portfolio here. Can you just dig in and just let us know – you
previously had done a lot on the Commercial portfolio. And I'm just wondering, have you done – and you currently
deep diving into the CRE book as you've talked about on the credit side, what might there still be to do on the
Commercial side of the portfolio in terms of BSO from that perspective? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I mean, I think and as you know, in this portfolio that we've set up, it's entirely a retail portfolio in terms of
that $14 billion. But there are nevertheless in parallel BSO activities continuing in the Commercial side, and let
Don talk about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So, we've been at this for probably three or four years now as we've just thrown out relationships where we
haven't been able to achieve the cross-sell that we thought we were going to achieve when we were going into
the credit several years ago. So, it's really an ongoing effort. It's been running about $1 billion a year, and we
probably will be running about that same pace. The good news is we've been able to replace some of that with
growth in places like New York Metro, where we see a good amount of opportunity on a full wallet basis,
particularly in the middle market as we bring on these new hires.
On the CRE side, as everybody knows, there's not a lot of liquidity, but there is some liquidity and we're actually
moving some of our exposures out through the agencies and through some private capital also. So, we'll try to
liquefy particularly multifamily over the next couple of quarters, couple of years to the best we can and bring those
overall exposures down even though they're performing pretty well.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I would say that is something we felt comfortable with in Q3. We were going through the – or Q2, we were
going through the CCAR process at the time, but we saw the opportunity to build, kind of have our cake and eat it
too, build the ratio while also repurchasing shares. And I think we'll still be in that position. So, we still have non-
core kind of rundown working for us, which is releasing RWAs. So, you should again have a chance to somewhat
have your cake and eat it too, both in Q3 and Q4.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thank you, Bruce. And then on the noninterest-bearing mix stabilizing at the 23%, near the 2Q level. Now,
what gives you confidence in the stabilization? I know you mentioned you're not pushing as aggressively. You
don't see the need to now on competition, on pricing. Is there anything, though, beyond that in terms of depositor
behavior that you're beginning to see that gives you that confidence that this is where it's bottoming?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I think there's two items that we look at. One is just the – as we are getting back to the historical place that
the platform generated noninterest-bearing pre-pandemic, and so that's been sort of a foundational spot that we
think creates some solidification of the operating accounts in both retail and consumer. So, that's one really
important spot. So, around that 23% level is about how we see it.
And then the second item is that in the second quarter, we started to see some deceleration for the first time in
several quarters, we started to see the turn and deposits kind of migration decelerating. And then we have a
number of, I would say, activities on the product and low-cost strategy front that we're seeing some really positive
uptick on in retail in particular and so.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, couple of quick points. Just a quick recall. As we've talked over the last bunch of quarters, the consumer
portfolio has been under a five to six-year transformation for quite some time and is in a very, very different
starting point to the beginning of the cycle than ever before for this franchise with significant improvements in
things like customer primacy, growth in households, our mass affluent mix has improved and low-cost deposit
profile has moved up. So, coming into the cycle, we were very confident that we'd be more peer like or maybe
19


Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
(CFG) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
outperform and data that we're seeing with benchmarking suggests and in the consumer bank we are indeed
better than average versus peers right now on all dimensions, interest-bearing cost, beta, as well as low-cost
control.
So, we feel pretty good how we're performing against the peers, it is starting to stabilize. So, the excess surge
deposits have burned down maybe by about 60%. So, there's still a little bit out there, but a lot of those are
starting to be sticky and turn into wealth creation. If you dissect the various different segments, the wealthier
segment is still having some modest outflows and rotation into interest-bearing, as well as rotation outside of the
banking industry. So, year-over-year, the wealthier segment is down about 10%. We're seeing the mass affluent
segment in deposits on a per customer basis about flat and the mass market portfolio has actually increased in
net deposits. And that's a function of a lot of our strategies that we've put in place to really drive primacy and
activity and engagement. And so, we've seen a bit of a bottoming at the lower end in terms of DDA balances.
What we had done to drive that is a lot of product innovation. So, we did things like get your paycheck two days
early. It doesn't seem like a big deal. It's actually an incredibly big deal and it's driving a lot of primary banking
behavior. We've got technology we put in place that when you open a new DDA, you're automatically porting over
your direct deposit. It seems very operationally oriented, but it actually is a dramatic improvement that things like
primary banking behavior, which drives low-cost deposits. We've made overdraft reform through our Peace of
Mind, 24-hour grace program and a variety of other things, which has also driven a lot of primacy. And we're
starting to really rev up the engines on household growth.
Overall, all of those things contribute to some controllables. So, I think we're outperforming peers on the market
given our starting point in the cycle and we're continuing to invest to try to further outperform through all of these
different initiatives and strategies. It is the long game. These are driving primacy and low-cost deposits, takes a
while to build up scale. But I feel like we've got a lot of the right things in place in addition to outperforming on our
back book to win the game on controllables where we're at right now.

So, while you're two-thirds of the deposit base and have all these great strategies you've done, you've also been
investing in payments capabilities and some new products like sustainable deposits, maybe you could just offer...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, that's right, I mean, we've been broadening out our deposit base quite nicely. And as Bruce said, it's a
combination of just the growth in the cash management business overall and bringing on more clients on the cash
management side. As I said, in New York Metro, the things that we're adding are really full wallet, full cash
management relationships, those bring really nice deposits. And then on the product side, we've done a lot
around green deposits and carbon offset deposits in our ESG strategy. Those have proved to be quite profitable.
We've built out escrow products and bankruptcy products. So, there's a variety of product development things
which are attracting nice operating deposits with some [indiscernible] (01:03:21).

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay, great. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. I appreciate all the detail on the office book. It looks like you have a pretty conservative
assumption baked into your CRE office reserve levels of 8%. I guess the question is what would you need to see
to take that up even more or over the next few quarters, as some of your office portfolio comes up for renewal,
should we expect the reserve levels go down as you have more normalized NCOs in that portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Let me start and John or Don can add, but we feel quite good about A, the overall nature of what we have; and B,
then so there's good diversification, good quality characteristics. We have some really good people that are really
focused hard on this and they're monitoring this loan by loan. They see the upcoming maturities. They get way in
front of those. So, we're having good dialog with borrowers. And I'd say we did a good job – relatively good job in
the first half of absorbing some of the maturities. And probably about 30 loans, I think, came up for maturity, which
is about the number that we're going to have in the second half. And it's about the number that we're going to
have in the first half of next year. It's about the number that we're going to have in the fourth quarter next year.
And if you look at the net result of that, while we have an increase in criticized, we have an increase – this quarter
was a little lumpy in NPAs in the sector, and that probably levels off, I'd say, we were able to build our reserve and
absorb charge-offs. So, we took $56 million in charge-offs. So, that's another, and a 1.5% loss content. If you look
at the 8%, it's effectively higher by what we just absorbed.
And so, could we go for another few quarters with absorbing charge-offs kind of on a pay-as-you-go basis with
what we're providing and hold the reserve flat? Yeah, possibly that could happen. And then at some point, does
that tip over? And then you don't need as much reserve because you've burned some of those losses through
your charge-off line. So, anyway, that's just a little color about how we think about it.
John, I don't know if you want to add anything, or go direct to Don.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I'll just reiterate the fact that, as you mentioned, we took $56 million. That's 1.5%. So, that we've got 8.5% –
we've got 8% set aside. So, that implies a 9.5% coverage for the losses through the cycle. And we think that's
pretty darn adequate, as a matter of fact, very strong. And so, I think that you also mentioned NPLs flattening out
and charge-offs kind of getting into run rate rather than step change from here, which I think is important to
reemphasize, and maybe just turn it over to Don.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
No, I think you guys have said it was 26 loans. So, you're pretty close to 30. That's pretty good. You know that.
But I think the thing I'd emphasize is we've literally gone through every single loan one by one and everyone is
21

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
different. It's property specific, it's MSA specific, it's rent roll specific, it's sponsor specific. And we're starting to
see outcomes, and outcomes are – a property gets extended and renegotiated with the sponsor. You might have
a little bit of equity injected to improve interest carry, and you might charge it off. So, and I think that we have a
pretty good eye to the path of the book as we look forward. And things could always change. But I think we feel
pretty comfortable that we've been very conservative based on what we see.
And I will emphasize, I mean, we're not originating anything really of any scale in origination. So, our whole
origination team, in addition to our credit team, in addition to our [indiscernible] (01:07:30) team, is focused on
working with our sponsors to basically...
[indiscernible] (01:07:36)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And by the way, the rest of the real estate, both multifamily, industrial, datacenters, I think looks like it's holding up
extremely well. We're really not seeing any weakness that concerns us at all in the rest of the real estate book.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
That's very helpful. Thanks for the fulsome answer. Just to move on to capital, is there any color you can share on
what drove the increase in the stress capital buffer this year? I know the mortgage was something that was a little
bit of a headwind for the whole group. But any other information you've gleaned from your conversations with the
Fed and then maybe what you need to do to bring that down in future years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, we haven't really had the full debrief. So, we're getting that set up, so we can go through and kind of
understand their models better. I think that's been one of the concerns of the industry that it's not that transparent
to us, but kind of when we look at the results, there's a couple of things that could have been a factor. So, one is
the build of the allowance. When we took relatively high charge-offs, we had a significant build was built into their
models which we didn't have in our models. And that alone probably cost us 30 basis points of the 60 basis points
increase or something like that.
So, that's one thing that we'll want to talk about and understand better and then, questions about, we did a deal
and did the onetime expenses get incorporated, or we've done a lot of hedging in the falling rate scenario. Are our
hedges getting full benefit? So, we just have some questions we want to poke at. But in any case, I think the
bigger point here is that we can roll with this, the 8.5%, and we have plenty of capital and we have a appreciable
buffer versus that capital. So, it really doesn't affect kind of our capital management strategies. But we would like
to see it, get kind of back into line. We think it's a bit elevated relative to where it should be. And we'll be having
those conversations with the Fed in the coming weeks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think that as you get past this year where we had those integration expenses and there's a hypothesis that
that will roll off as you get into next year. We'll have another bite at the apple next year, given the fact that we're
going to be doing this again. And, in the end, the SCB is not our constraint. Our constraint is our own view of what
capital we need to be prudent to support our business and, frankly, where the Fed and regulators are headed with
22

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
required kind of levels outside of the SCB is going to be our constraint. So, we're going to be, as Bruce mentioned
earlier, about 200 basis points over the SCB by the end of the year and probably heading towards earlier
compliance with whatever the Fed comes out with at most. So, we're feeling pretty darn good about the capital
position, notwithstanding the SCB.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And the BSO should have a positive impact on your risk-weighted assets. Should that also have a positive
impact on the SCB?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Well, it might. I mean, I think more importantly, it gives us the flexibility to rotate RWA capital into relationship
lending and return that capital to the extent that there was front book opportunities are not there. We probably
have the opportunity to do both where we rotate that capital into relationship lending and provide an ability to buy
back, doesn't have a direct impact on the SCB.

Operator: And your next question – one moment, please. Your next question will come from the line of Vivek
Juneja. Go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thank you. Just a follow-up on the First Republic banker question. Bruce, Brendan, what requirements do you
– what are your pricing assumptions? You said you're planning to bring the pricing to yours, but then what are the
assumptions for what the bankers need to deliver to be able to recoup their or earn their guarantees? And
secondly, given that this was a white-glove service, which is obviously very expensive, what changes are you
planning to make to that to be able to get to your hurdle profitability targets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Yeah, thanks for the question. We already prior to the lift-out of the private bankers had a relationship-
based pricing in play in all of our asset classes including mortgage. So, when you bring heavy levels of deposits
and AUM, we price down modestly for that. So, we don't have any intention of changing what we already do. And
so, our new private bankers will have access to the same relationship pricing grids that we've had in place for a
while. So, as you think of our pricing and yields of things like mortgages or even some of the small business,
commercial lending, we're not expecting a dramatic different profile in terms of profitability or yields from legacy
Citizens and how we operate the business to make sure that we're considering the full relationship and that we're
really competitive in pricing, but we're not undercutting the market by a material amount that will deteriorate either
lending, return...

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
And I think the corollary to that is that the teams that came over understand that...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
They do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
...and so, I'd say the one thing that they won't have in their arsenal is deeply discounted mortgages. But I think
they come in with their eyes wide open on that. And quite honestly, the deeply discounted mortgages are
probably now back on your balance sheet because people aren't refinancing those at a good clip. So, they'll
probably sit there for a long time. But anyway, we will kind of do business in a commercial way. And again, the
bigger the relationship, the better the pricing generally. And so, I think the team coming over is very comfortable
with that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And then a question around expenses implied in the comments that John and Bruce both made around
breakeven inside of 2024 is the team's production covering kind of [indiscernible] (01:14:20) to come over. So,
we've been really thoughtful about how we do that. But obviously, we've got the way these folks get paid, it's on a
book of business model and they're going to go out and develop a lot of business and we're going to give them
the runway to do that. We had a lot of debate with them on the appropriate timing to make that happen, and make
sure the operations excellence is available here at Citizens. With that the cost of that is considered in all of our
guidance and commentary we made about the profitability of the business and we're already well underway on
tinkering with the way the bank works to make sure we're creating the conditions for them.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And I'd say there we'd probably have the brakes on a little bit to make sure that we get it to the level because you
kind of get one shot with some of these customers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And so, we've got a full effort on making sure that we get to the standards that we need. I would say one other
silver lining from that also is that, that'll help us up our game in customer experience more broadly, the kind of
initiatives that we're taking to make sure that we make this a great experience. There'll be some things that spin
off from that, that we can move to other parts of the bank without a question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. And a follow-up for just Don. Don, what are you seeing on the whole sponsor side given with
high rates in the market? What level do you expect it to come back to even in 2024, say, just given if rates stay
24

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
high? Yes, some cuts, but I don't think anybody is expecting it to go back to where we were a year and a half ago.
So, any thoughts on what level of activity do you think we get back?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. We'll see high level our pipelines are about 30% higher than they were at this time last quarter. So, we're
seeing the pipelines build. The sponsors are certainly engaging in conversations whether they can get to actual
transactions or not, although there have been some – there was a [ph] Worldpay (01:16:20) transaction that was
announced a few weeks ago. So, we're beginning to see some transactions. Remember, one of the things that we
benefit from, and I've said this a couple of quarters, is we tend to play in smaller deals, right? So, we're $100
million to $750 million to $1 billion in terms of deal size, whether it be advisory or financing. We were number one
in the middle market leverage finance league tables in the last quarter. Volumes were down, but we were the
number one institution playing. So, we're gaining share for what's available.
So, do I think we're going to be back to 2021 levels? No, but I think if you get stability in rates, it's the beginning of
deal formation will happen and it'll just depend on valuation dynamics between sponsors and sellers and there's
just a lot of companies in our portfolio that just need to sell. They want to sell for generational reasons. So, there
are things that are available. Deals may get over-equitized just to keep the interest burden down, value doesn't
come down, but we're starting to see a lot of conversations going. So, I don't think we're going to be off to the
races, but I think it's going to continually build. And I think 2024 could be a pretty good year.
