Curtis Chatman Farmer
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, we reported second quarter earnings of $206
million or $1.49 per share, outperforming the first quarter on both a reported and an adjusted basis. Although
average loans declined, our targeted focus on responsible growth drove an inflection in balances throughout the
quarter.
In an uncertain economic and political environment, customer sentiment appeared slightly less optimistic than last
quarter. However, a number of our businesses saw positive momentum, and we believe our pipeline supports our
group outlook. As expected, net interest margin started to rebound and both noninterest income and noninterest
expenses improved. Credit quality remained strong, reflecting our prudent underwriting discipline. Being a
responsible company is deeply embedded in our culture. And in June, we published our 16th annual Corporate
Responsibility Report detailing our commitments to this important topic. We remain proud of our efforts to
prioritize our employees and communities.
Once again, U.S. News recognized us as one of the best companies to work for, and we were named one of the
50 most community-minded organizations. We feel responsible business is a good business, and we take pride in
the unique role we play in supporting our markets.
Second quarter financial highlights are on slide 4. Average loans were impacted by muted first quarter demand,
but balances increased consistently throughout the quarter. Our deliberate first quarter reduction in brokered time
deposits drove a majority of the decline in average deposits. However, we also continue to see pressure on
noninterest-bearing balances, as we near what we believe may be the peak of the rate cycle. The decline in net
interest income reflected both lower Fed deposits and average loans. Charge-offs remain below historical
averages at 9 basis points, and our loan loss reserve declined modestly.
Even excluding the net benefit from lower notable items, both noninterest income and noninterest expenses saw
favorable trends. Taxes increased due to higher income and less of a benefit from discrete items. And our
estimated CET1 of 11.55% remained above our 10% strategic target.
While we remain in an elevated rate environment, we think the favorable customer-related trends, coupled with
the expected structural benefit to net interest income in the coming quarters, positions us well.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim to review our second quarter financial results in more detail. Jim?

Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 5. Trailing effects of rationalization efforts, coupled
with soft demand at the start of the year, impacted average loan balances in the second quarter.
Low utilization trends persisted in Equity Fund Services, although balances rebounded in June and elevated rates
continue to impact Wealth Management loans. Commercial Real Estate utilization trended higher. However,

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
period-end balances remained flat to the first quarter. We have been purposefully managing commitments and
originations in this space for several quarters, and we expect to begin to see growth subside in this business.
Total loan balances grew consistently throughout the quarter, with period-end loans up over $1 billion. National
Dealer Services contributed to quarter-end growth, with elevated balances due in part to the cyberattack that
impacted dealerships nationwide in June, but we also saw increases across most business lines. Our pipeline
remains strong and supports our expectation for continued growth.
Moving to slide 6. Average deposit balances declined $2.3 billion, but almost 70% of the decrease was attributed
to lower brokered time deposits. Pressure on noninterest-bearing balances increased relative to trends we
observed in the latter half of the first quarter, as customers utilize funds to support ongoing business activity or
reduce borrowings.
Tax-related seasonality impacted select businesses such as municipalities. While we saw some deposit remixing
at the customer level, it did not appear to be the biggest driver. Even with noninterest-bearing balance trends and
ongoing success in winning new interest-bearing deposit relationships, we believe our noninterest-bearing mix
remained peer leading, averaging 40% for the quarter.
Interest-bearing deposit cost improved 5 basis points, driven by lower brokered time deposits, and increases in
customer deposit pricing continued to flatten. As rates decline, we expect to see an inflection point in deposit
balances, mix and costs. In the meantime, we remain encouraged by our success in growing interest-bearing
deposits and continued pricing discipline.
Period-end balances in our securities portfolio on slide 7 declined with continued paydowns and maturities, as the
mark-to-market adjustment remained relatively flat. We expect continued decline in balances through at least the
end of the year.
Turning to slide 8. Net interest income decreased $15 million to $533 million, driven by lower Fed deposits and
loan balances, partially offset by decline in wholesale funding. Impacts from the BSBY cessation drove $6 million
of the decline, as we recognized a $3 million noncash loss in the second quarter compared to a $3 million
increase in the first quarter. As a reminder, you can find the expected future BSBY impacts in the appendix to the
slides. Normalization of our cash position drove an increase in net interest margin for the quarter.
As shown on slide 9, successful execution of our interest rate strategy and the composition of our balance sheet
positions us favorably for a gradual 100 basis points or 50 basis points on average decline in interest rates. By
strategically managing our swap and securities portfolios while considering balance sheet dynamics, we intend to
maintain our insulated position over time.
Credit quality remained strong as highlighted on slide 10. Net charge-offs of 9 bps decline for the second
consecutive quarter and remain well below our normal range. Although customers continued to navigate high
borrowing costs and inflation, we saw an improvement in criticized loans, concentrated in our core middle market
businesses.
Non-accrual loans ticked up slightly, but still remained below historical averages. We did not observe any new
emerging pressures and metrics within our incrementally monitored portfolios remain relatively consistent. With a
reduction in the allowance for credit losses to 1.38% of total loans, we continue to believe ongoing migration will
remain manageable.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
On slide 11, second quarter noninterest income of $291 million increased $55 million, although a majority of the
increase was related to the impact of BSBY cessation in the first quarter, we were encouraged to see growth
across most customer related categories. Capital markets income grew in each product, including M&A advisory
services as a result of the new team we put in place last year.
Fiduciary income saw seasonal tax related increases and brokerage income benefited from investments in our
new platform for Comerica Financial Advisors. We were pleased to see successful revenue growth associated
with our strategic focus on noninterest income and continue to prioritize these key investments.
Expenses on slide 12 improved $48 million over the prior quarter. Salaries and benefits declined $25 million, with
seasonally lower stock-based compensation as the biggest driver. FDIC expense came down due to the large
special assessment in the first quarter. Other expenses declined, including consulting, operational losses, and
asset impairment costs associated with real estate rationalization, partially offset by seasonally higher advertising.
Overall, expense management remains a high priority as we continue to seek opportunities to drive positive
operating leverage and efficiency.
As shown on slide 13, higher profitability coupled with conservative capital management, drove increases across
all of our key capital ratios. Our estimated CET1 grew to 11.55%, and adjusting for the AOCI opt-out, our
estimated CET1 remained above required regulatory minimums and buffers.
Despite volatility throughout the quarter, at quarter end, AOCI remained relatively flat. As we think about ongoing
capital management, we need to continue to monitor AOCI movement, our loan outlook and regulations as they
evolve.
Before moving to the outlook, as indicated on slide 14, we recently received preliminary notification from the
Fiscal Service that Comerica Bank was not selected to continue serving as the financial agent for the Direct
Express prepaid debit card program following the expiration of our contract early next year. This process remains
fluid as contract negotiations are not yet final, but at this time we do not expect that Comerica Bank will retain the
business long-term.
As detailed on the slide, we recognized noninterest income and card fees, but that is generally offset by expenses
associated with managing the program. The financial value has been in the noninterest-bearing deposit balances
related to monthly benefits funded on the cards which have grown over time and averaged $3.3 billion in the
second quarter. As we have discussed in the past, there are various potential scenarios with regards to the timing
and mechanics of the deposit transition and we expect more detail in the coming quarters as terms become final.
However, our experience with this program leads us to believe this transition may be longer than shorter and we
do not currently anticipate an impact to 2024 deposit balances, noninterest income, or expenses. While we have
been honored to manage this important program, we see this as an opportunity to refocus and reprioritize
resources towards targeted deposit strategies more aligned with our core relationship operating model. Several of
these key initiatives are listed on slide 15, and leverage proven expertise coupled with strategic investments, with
the goal of driving core deposit growth and consistent funding over time.
As an example, we have been leaning into our competitive position as the leading bank for business to expand
our focus within small business. Expected growth in this space should enhance the granularity and consistency of
our deposit profile. And we were encouraged to see our investments drive favorable customer trends for the
quarter.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
Select talent acquisition and business optimization activities in treasury management and payments have been
designed to further capitalize on our strong core product set and should allow us to deliver more comprehensive
liquidity solutions to our customers. Through our experience with Direct Express, we have developed competitive
card capabilities that we are already leveraging to win new relationships. Online enhancements within retail were
intended to further improve the user experience while expanding our customer reach.
Finally, we see opportunities to leverage our existing delivery model, strong product set, and industry knowledge
to further target deposit rich customers, which should help drive stable funding opportunities. In short, we are very
excited about the deposit initiatives we are executing on and look forward to continuing to prioritize deposit growth
as a key strategic focus.
Our outlook for 2024 is on slide 16. We project full year average loans declined 4% or grow 2% point to point from
year-end 2023 to 2024. Trailing effects from our strategic optimization efforts and muted demand across the
industry dampened our outlook slightly. However, our strong pipeline and momentum still supports broad-based
growth expectations in the second half of the year.
Full year average deposits are projected to be down 3% from 2023 or down 2% point to point. We expect average
brokered time deposits to be relatively consistent from full year 2023 to full year 2024. Although we anticipate
some level of continued cyclical pressure on noninterest-bearing balances and ongoing success in winning new
interest-bearing deposits, we expect to maintain a favorable deposit mix in the upper 30s.
The combination of noninterest-bearing deposit trends and lower average loans impacts our net interest income
outlook as we now project a 14% decline year-over-year. On a quarterly basis, we expect those same deposit and
loan pressures and the negative impact from BSBY cessation to drive a 2% to 3% decline in net interest income.
Adjusting for BSBY, third quarter net interest income is only expected to decline a modest 1% as we believe we
are at the cyclical low point. We also believe deposit costs will continue to increase slightly until rates begin to
decline.
Credit quality remains strong and successful recoveries helped drive lower net charge-offs this quarter. With
persistent elevated rates and inflationary pressures, we believe modest migration is possible. However, we expect
it to remain manageable. Given our strong results to date, we forecast full year net charge-offs to approach but
remain below the lower end of our normal 20 to 40 basis point range.
We expect noninterest income to grow approximately 1% to 2% on a reported basis, which would be down 1%
year to year when adjusting for BSBY and the impact of the Ameriprise transition as detailed in the appendix.
Third quarter noninterest income is expected to decline 3% to 4%, driven largely by lower projected noncustomer
income. Within the second quarter, we recognized a $6 million gain due to our derivative related to the Visa Class
B exchange program, and benefited from smaller valuation adjustments accounted for in other income.
We project lower FHLB dividends consistent with lower wholesale funding, and we expect risk management
income to decline based on the forward curve and our hedge position. Despite these noncustomer trends, we
remained very encouraged about our customer-related momentum and investments to grow fee income over
time.
Full year noninterest expenses are expected to decline 2% to 3% on a reported basis to grow 4% after adjusting
for special FDIC assessments, expense recalibration, modernization and the accounting impact from the
Ameriprise transition.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
Third quarter noninterest expenses are expected to increase 3% to 4% over the relatively lower second quarter
levels, as we intend to reinvest savings from our expense calibration efforts into head count aligned with our risk
management and strategic priorities. We also expect to see elevated occupancy expense associated with
transitioning our corporate facilities and seasonally higher taxes, maintenance and repair.
With an ongoing focus on expense discipline, we continued to seek opportunities to offset or self-fund emerging
pressures. Even with the strong projected loan growth in the second half of the year, we expect our CET1 ratio to
remain well above our 10% strategic target through year-end. We will continue to monitor AOCI and the
regulatory environment as we take a conservative approach to share repurchases in 2024. Despite some near-
term cyclical pressures, we expect continued momentum in the second half of the year to position us well for
2025.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Curtis Chatman Farmer
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. We are proud of our second quarter results and find the more recent loan and fee income growth
trends, coupled with our overall earnings trajectory, to be compelling.
As highlighted on slide 17, we feel we have a unique value proposition, and it starts with our strong foundation of
credit, capital and liquidity. From that foundation, we execute on a diversified strategy across select markets and
businesses designed to mitigate risk and deliver enhanced returns over time.
Tying our strong foundation together with our differentiated strategy, we feel we are well positioned for future
growth. We expect meaningful structural tailwinds to net interest income due to anticipated maturities and
repayments within our swap and securities portfolio. Our strategic investments are designed to drive consistent
capital-efficient income and we saw encouraging results from those investments this quarter.
Finally, we believe our balance sheet is well positioned for responsible, profitable growth as we leverage our
demonstrated strength as a commercial lender and prioritize our targeted deposit initiatives. While the market
remains focused on the timing and magnitude of rate cuts, we feel we have positioned our balance sheet to drive
long-term value regardless of the rate environment.
We appreciate your time this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question today is coming from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys. Look, I'd like to follow up on the Direct Express and just ask you, you mentioned
that it could be delayed to some point. So, I'm just wondering if you can walk us through the steps from here.
When do you think you'll know when that start point is? And then, I think the most important is the $3.3 billion of
average deposits. What would be the natural trajectory of time for those to kind of go to zero in the scenario you
actually don't keep them all, even under the transition at start point? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Ken, it's Peter. So, at this point, all of this indication from the Fiscal Service is preliminary. So, what the
next few months looks like will sort of be to be determined. And we hope over the next couple of quarters to get a
little more clarity on what the transition does look like. I would tell you, our focus is on working really closely with
the Fiscal Service to make sure that this is a very smooth transition for the customer base here. That's really
important to us. And I know it's important to them as well. And so, we want to be sure that we're able to execute
on that for them.
And as far as the timeline of what the deposits look like and when they leave, as we have said for quite a while
now, we believe that to be a longer time period rather than a shorter time period. That's about as much clarity as I
can give to you on it, because we just don't really know. I would tell you that our experience, having managed this
program for a very long time now, is that this is a significant transition. There is 4.5 million cardholders and that
this would take a long period of time. So, that's going to be something that we will learn hopefully in the coming
quarters. And as we get more clarity on it, our intention would be to provide that clarity to you as well. And I would
tell you also that, we continue to be very focused on running our playbook for our relationship model. As Curt and
Jim have said in our comments, we feel like we've got a whole lot of ways to manage this on a go-forward basis
for the company and feel like we'll be able to redirect these resources to be more focused on what we really do as
a leading bank for business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. And then just bigger-picture question, in the scenario where you don't keep it and even if there is a
long tail, it still could be a decent hit to earnings power. How much does this change just overall, if at all, strategic
thinking about where the company is going in terms of adjusting to a different potential earnings power level?

James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Ken. It's Jim. I would start out by saying that it is absolutely our intention to replace these deposits
over time. As I look at it, short-term, of course, there'll be no effect. We do think it will be somewhat of an
elongated transition. Long-term, we do expect to replace these deposits and we expect to replace them with core
customer deposits that as Peter and Curt said, probably better fit our business model. Medium-term, we'll wait
and see how the transition goes. But over time, it is our expectation to replace these with core deposits and
minimize the impact, potentially no impact over the long-term. Having said that, to the extent there is a bit of a
transition in the medium-term, we do start with a great balance sheet, low levels of wholesale funding, low loan-to-
deposit ratio. We don't think it affects us strategically. And I would just emphasize that it is our intention over time
to replace these deposits, to remove any impact to long-term profitability.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Just following up on the question, thinking about how the balance sheet you may react with
your balance sheet, you've got a bond portfolio that throws off a lot of cash. Is one – I'm trying to get a better
handle on, is that scenario replace the deposits with interest-bearing over time which is a hit or selling perhaps
low yielding bonds, which would perhaps be less of an impact? Any color on that would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Chris. It's Jim. We do think the bond portfolio will continue to run down through the end of the year
and generate cash. The way I think of it as, that bond portfolio will essentially fund our loan growth between now
and the end of the year, perhaps early next year. I wouldn't necessarily lean on the bond portfolio for anything
related to the Direct Express program, which is really again, a longer-term issue. And, we'll certainly be buying
securities by the time we have some type of longer transition for Direct Express. So, I view the bond portfolio as
more of a shorter-term tactic to fund our loan growth at this point.

Peter L. Sefzik A

Yeah, Chris. This is Peter. You know, quite candidly, we really can't comment and don't plan to comment on sort
of what the decision process was or wasn't that the physical service made. What we can tell you is that we did
submit what we felt like was a very competitive bid with our full understanding of this program, like I said, for a
long period of time. And the complexities that come with it. So, we're very proud of how we've managed this all of
these years, and we felt very good about what we submitted as being the right thing for both parties and including
the consumers. And at the end of the day, the decision process is sort of left up to the Fiscal Service and not one

Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, guys. Good morning. Could you talk to your interest rate sensitivity analysis on page 9 of the deck? You're
liability sensitive and the forward curve assumptions have changed since 1Q. And I wanted color on your
underlying assumptions. Just how we kind of think about it in the forward. And then just I know you've kind of
outlined about $100 million benefits from less drags and swaps in 2025, and wondering if there are any updates
there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning, Bernard. It's Jim. Yes, we are. We are modestly liability sensitive. That liability sensitivity
has increased slightly from the last quarter. I do think of this as largely interest neutral, but the liability sensitivity is
growing just a little bit, which I think is a great position to be in at this point of the cycle. Obviously, the rate cuts

that occur according to the curve in 2024 will be more back ended. So, while it is a little bit of a lift for the 2024
projection, it's not a huge lift. It's really going to be more of a 2025 play. We did assume the June 30 curve in the
outlook, though, frankly, if we had updated that curve after the CPR report came out, it really wouldn't have
moved the overall outlook materially. And again, that's because so many of these cuts are occurring late in the
year.
Regarding, the maturing swaps and securities. And we do have a slide in the appendix on slide 23 that outlines
the maturing swaps and securities. I have talked in the past about the fact that we expect to get about $100
million uplift from those maturities in 2025. Now, that's a very simple calculation assuming rates were to stay
constant. If rates were to move, number one, it depends when rates move. We may take some of that benefit in
2024. So, obviously that will reduce the lift in 2025. But in an absolute sense, you'd still be getting it. And at all,
that $100 million also assumes these maturities and rate movements occur in a vacuum. And as we know,
nothing occurs in a vacuum. If rates do move down, other parts of the balance sheet are going to be impacted,
including all the swaps and the swaps that are currently on the books that are not maturing they would certainly
benefit. So, you have this $100 million of maturing swaps and securities in a vacuum, but all these other factors
get rolled into what amounts to our modest liability sensitivity.
And I would just say that if the balance sheet and rates perform as expected, we would probably get a little less
than $100 million for those maturing swaps and securities, but you would likely make that up with our modest
liability sensitivity. So, you really get it one way or the other, assuming, the balance sheet responds as we model
it. But of course, we'll wait and see how things actually play out. But I think big picture, we feel pretty good about
that number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay, great. And then just maybe following up on the noninterest-bearing deposits, I think it was mentioned,
obviously, there is continued typical pressure. But, the narrative changed maybe a bit recently and just wanted to
get your sense on, would you expect like outflows to continue would be migration, would you potentially be
slowing once, you know, three, four cuts kind of occur? Because obviously, the rate differential is high. And, even
if we get three, four cuts, it still remains relatively higher than it has been over the past several years. So, just
want to get some thoughts on how you think that that could migrate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Sure, Bernard. We have been saying that as long as rates stay higher for longer, we do expect to see some
modest pressure on noninterest-bearing deposits. I think that's natural with rates being at this level. I'll reinforce
that we are at the apex of the cycle at this point. So, this is probably where you are – we're seeing this maximum
pressure and it's a little uncomfortable, but we do expect it to turn as rates move downwards in the latter part of
the year.
In terms of, the overall outlook, you see that our average deposits in Q2 were about $25.5 billion. We do think Q3
is likely be slightly more than $1 billion lower than that. So, that's just slightly below where we ended up on June
30. And we think that's the low point. We do see noninterest-bearing deposits for both seasonal reasons as well
as, rates moving down. We actually see a slight increase then in Q4, and we would expect to see those continue
to increase, as we move through 2025. So, we absolutely seem to be at the apex of the cycle with maximum
pressure on noninterest-bearing deposits. But we do see that turning later this year.

Hi. So, you said you have industry-leading noninterest-bearing deposits to a total of 40%. I think that's about
double peer average. But that might be going lower. Just remind us why is that so far ahead of peer. And what's
in the range, what's been the low point of that over the last two decades and what's been the high point, and
where do you think that settles out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Mike. It's Jim. Yeah, we are very proud of that ratio. I would point to the fact that we have been
very focused, really for the last decade-plus on payments and treasury management services. And we believe
that is a huge driver and something that really differentiates us. I would put that as the largest factor. Certainly,
our commercial orientation helps a little bit because we have noninterest-bearing deposits. But, of course, we do
offer a bit of an ECA or ECR on that, which is somewhat of a pseudo-interest rate. But it's really part of our
business model. We absolutely emphasize noninterest-bearing deposits when we extend credit, we expect to get
the deposit, we expect to get the treasury management services, and those noninterest-bearing deposits tend to
accompany those services.
Now, where we've been in the past? Yeah, we've been much lower than that in the past, before some of the
treasury management initiatives had ramped up. I would also say that in the past we had a very high loan-to-
deposit ratio if you go back to pre-financial crisis, as many banks did throughout the industry. And so, as a result,
we were offering much higher interest rates, which created a little bit more migration. We don't think we're going
to lean on brokered deposits anywhere close to that as we did in the past. We expect our loan-to-deposit ratio to
stay maintained. But I would say, in essence, it's our business model and it's what we emphasize as we go out
and solicit new business.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And just to follow up, the competitive environment seems as tough as it's ever been for regional banks with a lot
more bank expanding nationally. How do you see that competitive environment as it relates to the deposits and
your deposit guide and your loan guide? Is this cyclical and how much of this might be structural and at what point
would you consider buying other bank or combining with other banks, given the change in these strategic
environments? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Mike, this is Peter, and I'll comment first, and I'll let Curt maybe comment on the strategic part of it. But I think
from a competitive standpoint, we actually feel that's where the diversity of our model is just terribly compelling. A
number of regional banks are expanding nationally. We've been national for a long time. We've been in California
for a long time, in Texas, Michigan. We're expanding in the Southeast. But I think our national presence has been
very helpful when it comes to competitiveness on deposits. So, what you're trying to raise deposit-wise in
Michigan versus California versus Texas gives us lots of options. We also have a number of businesses that
really are national businesses like our TLS business, our Financial Services Division, where we're able to attract
customers and deposits in different ways that don't necessarily tie us to, let's say, CD rates in the small part of
Texas, for example, we've got a lot of handles that we're able to pull.
So, I totally agree with you, that's about as competitive as we've seen it in a long time, not just on deposits, really
on loans and pricing and structure across the country right now. It's picked up a lot in the last quarter. But I think
that, again, the diversity of our model, as we've tried to continue to communicate, is just terribly compelling and
gives us a lot of advantages in competing with regional banks, community banks and the larger banks.
And so, Curt, I might flip to you for...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Mike, thank you for that question. And on the strategic side, we have been a very patient acquirer, where
we have done one acquisition in the last 20 years, have continued to lean into our organic growth model. And the
last couple of years, we've seen nice growth on the asset side from the lending perspective and just expansion of
our customer base. And we think we continue to have really good opportunities to grow in all the markets that we
operate in, as well as the markets that we've expanded into more recently.
We'll have to wait and see how the environment unfolds. Thus far, it's been an environment with not a lot of M&A
occurring because of a lot of uncertainty around regulation and economy, et cetera. But certainly, it's something
made strategic cultural sense for us, and with a good fit, we would take a look at it in one of our primary
geographies. But again, that would not be our primary focus. Our primary focus continues to be on organic growth
and we think we have really good opportunities there.

Manan, good morning.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Apologies if I missed this in your prior remarks, but can you comment on your conversations
with customers on, when loan demand can really start to come back, right? So, I think, pipelines are pretty robust.
But across the industry, loan demand has been weak. Is it low rates that are going to bring back that demand? Is
it some of the uncertainty with the elections, et cetera, going away. Can you just talk about what your
conversations with customers have been?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Manan, it's Peter. I guess the answer to your question is probably a little bit of all the above. I think in our
surveys with customers, we get the sense that the number one driver of loan demand impact right now is interest
rates. And, we believe that to the extent that we start to see some reduction in rates that would impact loan
demand or lead to hopefully some more loan demand. And then, I would acknowledge, and I believe that, when
you talk to customers, there's just sort of a, I'd call it a wait and see a little bit as to what, how the year is going to
unfold when it comes to, as Curt said, the regulatory environment, get through the elections. And I just I feel like
historically that's a theme I've heard during presidential election years, for a long time, that most of your owner-
managed businesses kind of want to wait and see what things are going to look like after November. And then
they start to make decisions. So, to your point, and I know a number of banks have been talking about this, we
feel like, we've got a good outlook for the second half of the year. We're still showing positive point to point loan
growth for 2024 overall. But I think probably real demand doesn't pick up until you start to see interest rates come
down and we get through the election.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And maybe on the credit side, I know nothing notable to call out this quarter, criticized assets moved lower.
But you know that the investor conversation has pivoted to, some concerns around credit on the C&I side as
opposed to CRE. Anything specific you're seeing there, anything you're hearing from borrowers, and I think if as
growth starts to slow in the economy, how do you think that impacts the credit of the portfolio overall?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
Melinda A. Chausse A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Manan, it's Melinda. Yeah, obviously, we posted a pretty nice quarter and honestly in the C&I book was really
where we saw the improvement. It was pretty broad-based across a number of different industries that are sort of
embedded in core middle market. So, at this point, I'm not seeing, we're not seeing any trends in any one
particular segment. Now, having said that, customers that are exposed to the consumer, so B2C type companies,
service type companies are a little bit more challenged and probably going to are a little bit slower to show some
improvement if they're in that non-pass category.
But we feel really good about C&I, and quite frankly, they have navigated this high rate environment by, quite
frankly, managing cash flow really tightly. Honestly, utilization is low. So, that's probably where some of the
deposits have gone, quite frankly, because they want to utilize cash in the most efficient way, and that is to pay
down high cost debt. So, I feel pretty good about the C&I portfolio. That does not mean that we're not going to
continue to see some manageable level of migration and there could be some idiosyncratic event that impacts a
particular customer.
Commercial real estate, obviously, in a lot of focus, but our portfolio continues to perform quite well. It was very
stable this quarter. We continue to experience no delinquencies and no losses in our senior housing portfolio,
which was stressed because of rates, but also just the environment for housing coming out of COVID is very
elevated from a non-pass credit perspective, but is very stable at this point. So, I'm not seeing any major cracks
filled. As long as the economy continues to sort of chug along at that soft landing strategy, I think we'll be okay.
And we're well reserved, if there is any issues that arise.

Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the loan demand and loan growth commentary a little bit. So, I'm trying
to square what you said about how November is sort of the key catalyst here. And at the same time, [ph]
obviously, the guide (00:41:10) sort of assumes that the second half, there is a ramp-up in loan demand. So,
could you just help us understand, I guess, how much of the expected sort of demand pull through is 4Q or is
there something in the pipelines that you already see that makes you comfortable that we could see something
happen in the third quarter as well?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
Peter L. Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Sam, I think I would still say, though, that probably the number one factor is interest rates. And I think that
November would be the secondary factor to that. And I guess I would just say that as we see our pipelines, as we
sit right now, that's kind of where we're coming up with this 2% point to point loan growth. We had a great quarter
of $1 billion and point to point loan growth. And so, what we see for the rest of the year is that that should be able
to continue. And we're encouraged by what we see. And I would tell you, it's pretty broad-based across our
businesses, that growth, last year we had a number of businesses that we were sort of rationalizing, if you will,
getting through everything that occurred in 2023. And much of that is now picking back up and I think that as we
get into the second half of the year, the realization of that pipeline growth will start to be there. But I don't think it's
going to really, really pick up, as I said, until we do start to see some interest rates come down. So, as we sit right
now, [ph] our managers' (00:42:38) forecast, we feel really good about how the second half of the year looks on
the outlook that we're showing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thanks for that color. And just my follow-up is around the noninterest-bearing deposits and maybe a bit
more looking into 2025, I just wanted to get a better sense for what would need to happen in your mind to actually
see meaningful dollar balances move into the bank. I'm trying to get a better sense for that. Is it just simply rate
cuts or are there some increased leverage components that we would need to see before the dollars flow back
into these accounts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Hi, good morning, Sam, it's Jim. Of course, we're not offering any specific 2025 guidance at this time. But I would
say, it's really a function of three things. One, the rate environment, we typically do see noninterest-bearing
deposits grow all things equal as rates start to come down. So, that's certainly a factor. Business activity, again,
going back to answering Mike Mayo's question, noninterest-bearing deposits are certainly a point of emphasis for
us. And then just overall, economic growth, as GDP grows nominally and it does look like we're going to have
some decent nominal growth in 2025, you typically expect money supply, working capital levels within middle
market businesses to grow proportionately with that. So, we do think a number of factors are pointing the right
direction for noninterest-bearing deposits to start growing again, inflect later this year and then start growing in
2025. So, we feel like, again, we're going, right now, we're somewhat in the apex of that cycle, but we see some
real strong tailwinds for us and any really Commercial Bank as we move through 2025.
