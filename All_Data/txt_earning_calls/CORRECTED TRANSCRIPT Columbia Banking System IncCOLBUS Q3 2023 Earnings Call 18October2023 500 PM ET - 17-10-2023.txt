Jacquelynne Bohlen
Senior Vice President & Investor Relations Director, Umpqua Bank
Thank you, Valerie. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we review our third quarter 2023
results, which we released shortly after the market close today. The earnings release and corresponding
presentation, which we will refer to during our remarks this afternoon, are available on our website at
columbiabankingsystem.com.
With me this afternoon are Clint Stein, President and CEO of Columbia Banking System; Chris Merrywell and
Tory Nixon, the Presidents of Umpqua Bank; Ron Farnsworth, Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Namdar, Chief
Credit Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will take your questions.
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and are
intended to be covered by the safe harbor provision of federal securities law. For a list of factors that may cause
actual results to differ materially from expectations, please refer to slide 2 of our earnings presentation, as well as
the disclosures contained within our SEC filings. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures alongside
our discussion of GAAP results. We encourage you to review the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations provided in
our earnings release and throughout the earnings presentation.
I will now turn the call over to Clint.

Clint E. Stein
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thanks, Jacque. Good afternoon, everyone.
Columbia's third quarter results reflect our associates' emphasis on activities to generate business and drive
efficiencies for our franchise. Our focus on balanced growth resulted in relationship-driven expansion in our loan
portfolio and higher non-interest income. Despite industry headwinds, we continue to see stabilizing deposit
trends. Integration activities are winding down as we are now in our eighth month since the merger closed. I'm
pleased to report we achieved $140 million in annualized cost savings through quarter-end, surpassing our
originally announced target of $135 million. These savings are net of franchise reinvestment, which included
investments in talent, products, technology and strategic locations in de novo markets.
While our formalized cost savings objectives related to the merger are coming to an end, our focus on efficient
growth is not. We will continue to seek out offsets to our investments, driving our business forward in an efficient
manner, while enhancing shareholder value. Our talented associates, expanded footprint and customer focused
business model provide us with the resources and opportunities to profitably grow market share throughout the
west. Our future is bright and I look forward to providing updates on these objectives in subsequent quarters.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
I'll now turn the call over to Ron.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Okay. Thank you, Clint. And for those on the call who want to follow along, I will be referring to certain page
numbers from the earnings presentation.
Slide 4 lays out our Q3 performance ratios, noting stability in the NIM, our operating efficiency ratio at 52% and
our return on tangible common equity just over 20%. These are five-quarter views and recall we closed the
combination at the end of February this year.
Slide 5 shows our summary balance sheet, noting that our $0.8 billion of deposit growth exceeded net loan
growth resulting in the loan to deposit ratio falling back to 89%. We also reduced our short-term Federal Home
Loan Banks borrowings this quarter by $2.3 billion, which lowered our on-balance sheet interest-bearing cash
position to $1.9 billion.
On slide 6, we highlight the income statement trends. GAAP earnings were $0.65 per share, impacted by
declining merger expense as we complete the integration along with fair value changes due to higher interest
rates. On an operating basis, we earned $0.79 per share in Q3, about flat with Q2 as the increase in provision for
loan loss was offset by declining non-interest expense as we realized cost synergies. Operating PPNR was up
6.5% to $259 million in Q3.
Turn to slide 7, we break out Q3 GAAP earnings to help investors understand the non-operating and merger-
related impacts on results. First column represents our Q3 GAAP fully combined results with net income of $136
million or $0.65 per diluted share and return on tangible common equity of 17%. The second column includes our
non-operating designation for income statement changes again mostly related to fair value swings along with $23
million of merger and exit and disposal costs, including non-interest expense, which are further detailed out in the
appendix. These net to a $28 million reduction in Q3 earnings, resulting in the third column for operating income.
And again, our operating income for Q3 was $164.3 million or $0.79 per diluted share with our return on assets at
1.2% and return on tangible common equity at 20.5%.
We added pages to the appendix with trending on each of these columns. The discount accretion will be a steady
and reliable source of interest income over time, as the majority is driven by rate, not credit, providing us with a
steady build of capital over time. And recall, the CDI amortization does not impact tangible book value, so the
$0.17 per share from merger accounting was the equivalent of $0.28 per share added to tangible book value in
Q3. We'll continue to highlight and trend here to aid investors in valuing all our earnings streams and our tangible
book value excluding AOCI increased $0.45 during the quarter to $17.48 per share.
Moving to the next slide on section 9, we highlight net interest income and margin. Our NIM was steady from Q2
at 3.91%, resulting in $481 million of net interest income. The NIM, excluding merger accounting, was 3.28%.
We've reduced excess liquidity and cash late in Q3, which should have a positive effect on our NIM in Q4. Both
measures were at the upper end of our prior guidance, driven by the increase in customer deposits this quarter.
Slide 10 breaks out the repricing and maturity characteristics of the loan portfolio, noting 42% is fixed, 29% is
floating and 29% are adjustable.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Slide 11 provides an updated view of our combined interest rate sensitivity under both ramp and shock scenarios.
We've taken proactive measures to reduce the balance sheet sensitivity to a future declining rate environment.
You can see here the trending over the past year where our rates-down risk has been reduced significantly. And
noted below, we calculate our cycle-to-date funding basis, which are calculated on a combined company basis
over the periods presented for comparability.
As of the third quarter, our interest-bearing deposit portfolio [ph] has priced in (00:07:35) 37% of the Fed funds
rate increases. Notable here is the cost of interest-bearing deposits, which was 2.01% for Q3 and 2.18% for the
month of September. And again, the lift this quarter was influenced primarily by the additional broker deposits
which were used to pay off maturing Federal Home Loan Bank advances for a relatively neutral impact on our
funding costs. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 2.77% for the month of September and 2.78% at
September 30th, relatively in line with the 2.72% for the entire quarter.
Slide 12 breaks out non-interest income items, noting we had continued growth in service charges and card-
based fees due to higher revenue from customer-related products. The change in loans held at fair value at the
bottom was a direct result of the increasing long-term yields this quarter.
Next up on slide 13, we're happy to report we've exceeded our original cost synergy target of 12% or $135 million.
As of quarter-end, we've achieved $140 million in annualized go-forward cost synergies as we finalized our
integration. We expect that will lift to $143 million by year-end. Again, these amounts are net of reinvestments
made in various areas. Normalized in the month of September expense ex-CDI was $81.3 million, which would be
$245 million for the quarter in the middle of our prior Q4 guidance range, which we reiterate at $240 million, $250
million. Note on the right side of the waterfall from the prior quarter, this reduction is driven by lower comp,
occupancy and contract costs.
To better help investors given the combination accounting and moving forward on slide 14, we provided an
updated outlook for 2023 on several key financial statement items. Our current outlook is consistent with last
quarter's update with a tighter band around the margin as the third quarter's results came in at the upper end of
guidance, given favorable customer deposit flows.
Moving ahead to the next section on the balance sheet, on slide 16, we detailed out the investment portfolio. The
table takes you from current par to amortized cost to fair value, noting the difference between current par and
amortized cost is the combined net discount, which will be accreted to interest income over time. The decline in
market value this quarter, of course, resulted from higher market yields across the curve. As you can tell, I'm
excited about this portfolio as it gives us a significantly higher and stable earnings stream with greater optionality.
And the overall book yield was 3.61%, with an effective duration of 5.7 as of quarter end.
Slide 17 covers our liquidity, including deposit flows during the quarter. For comparability, we presented the table
on the left as we were combined for all periods presented. Total deposits increased $0.8 billion or 1.9% in the
third quarter, and customer accounts increased $89 million and again, we used the brokered, along with excess
cash, to fund a portion of the Home Loan Bank borrowing reduction. The upper right table details our off-balance
sheet liquidity, with $12.2 billion available as of quarter end. And below that, we had cash and excess bond
collateral not pledged [ph] for loans (00:11:10) to arrive at total available liquidity of $19.1 billion. This represents
142% of uninsured deposits as of quarter end.
Slide 18 provides the loan roll forwards, noting we sold $159 million of marked non-relationship resi loans in Q3.
Our loan portfolio increased 3% on an annualized basis from the sale of [indiscernible] (00:11:35).

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Turning now to slide 19, we present the remaining balance of discount marks as compared to the prior quarter
and at closing. For the AFS portfolio, the acquired discount was reduced $23 million via accretion to interest
income. And our earnings release detail, we include this $23 million, along with $19 million of higher bond interest
income from the portfolio restructure we completed post-close to arrive at the $42 million total accretion for loans.
On the loan side, we had $29 million of rate accretion and $6.4 million for credit. The total marks declined $93
million in Q3 through a combination of accretion to interest income and the loan sale.
And finally in the back on slide 26, we highlight our regulatory capital position, noting our risk-based capital ratios
increased roughly 25 basis points as expected in Q3. We expect to quickly approach our long-term capital target
of 12% on total risk-based capital, which will provide for enhanced flexibility to return excess capital to
shareholders.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Frank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Ron.
Slides 20 through 22 provide select characteristics of our loan portfolio, including the composition of our
commercial books and an overview of our office loans that highlights this diversified granular portfolio, primarily
supported by properties located in suburban markets.
Moving on, slide 23 displays our reserve coverage by loan category. Additionally, the remaining credit discount on
loans provides a further 23 basis points of loss absorbing capacity. The $37 million provision expense recorded in
the quarter accounts for several factors, including shifts in the loan portfolio mix and trends in credit migration.
The slight uptick in non-performing loans during the quarter suggests a move toward a more standard credit
environment following a phase of exceptionally high quality.
Slide 24 provides an overview of our consolidated credit trends. In general, our credit performance is and has
remained positive, excluding the anticipated trend in FinPac charge-offs. FinPac charge-offs remained elevated
during the third quarter, still centered in the trucking sector of the portfolio. However, the plateau and related
early-stage delinquency trends we discussed on last quarter's call resulted in a reduction in FinPac net charge-
offs which react on a lag to delinquencies. Excluding FinPac, charge-off activity at the bank remains at a very low
level.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris.

Christopher M. Merrywell
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Frank.
Turning to deposits. Slide 25 highlights the quality of our granular deposit base. As Ron noted, customer deposit
balances increased during the quarter, despite the continued effects of market liquidity tightening and inflation.
Our teams remain active in their markets and are focused on customer acquisition and retention resulted in net
deposit increases throughout many of our business lines. Strategic expansion also supports our business
generation activities. We opened our first retail branch in Utah during the third quarter, supporting our intention to

big businesses, their owners, their employees and any others in the communities we serve throughout our eight-
state western footprint.
We also selectively added to our talented associate base, including the addition of two key bankers in Northern
California, one in commercial and one in wealth management. We continue to capitalize on opportunities our
expanded customer base provides and our commitment to our relationship-focused model. I'm pleased to
announce our wealth management team had the best quarter in our company's history. We are positioned well
throughout our markets to win business and drive balanced growth.
I will now turn the call back over to Clint.

Clint E. Stein

Thanks, Chris.
Our regulatory capital position is outlined on slide 26. We remain above both well capitalized and our internal
threshold targets. And as Ron discussed, we expect capital to continue to accrete quickly in the coming quarters,
providing us with ample flexibility for future shareholder return.
This concludes our prepared comments. The team is now available to answer your questions. Valerie, please
open the call for Q&A.

Wanted to kind of look at that margin guidance you got for the full year. Looks like you hit the low end of the
3.85% for the full year. You've got to be – it looks like you've got to kind of really tank in the fourth quarter in terms
of margin. What would, I guess, if you could kind of frame up the environment of how you hit the low end of the
guidance for the full year on margin?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Jeff, it's Ron. Hey, good morning or good afternoon. That'll be similar to what we saw last quarter, right? So, it
depends on customer deposit flows. If we're on the upper – if we're positive on that front, we'll be on the upper
end and if we're negative on that front, we'd be on the bottom end. Feel pretty good about that at the end of the
quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. So, again, all right, it seems pretty – well, I'll move on. On the credit side, maybe just on the increase in
non-performers, could we kind of breakout what type that was in and perhaps where within the footprint?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
It was really centered in two commercial accounts with the bank, both of them had been struggling for quite some
time. And one of them just decided to cease operations. And so, that one migrated into non-performing and the
balance of it is really associated with – in terms of non-performing assets is that slight escalation in the 90-day
plus in residential construction. In terms of geography, they were located – one of them was located in Portland,
kind of the Pearl District of Portland. And another one was located in California.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Got it. And I guess the expectation, if we kind of track FinPac losses, like you said, kind of a lagging
indicator on and tied to delinquencies, is that still the case that we've seen that plateau and if we follow
delinquencies, that continue to come down on that end?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
It is still the case. I mean, I will say that things – the third quarter has a few holidays in it that impacts collection
activity, any impact to collection activity really hampers obviously reducing those past dues. And we had that in
the third quarter. Had we not had that in the third quarter, we would have seen some further improvement. But
that trend should continue, obviously, into the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter is usually another difficult one for
collection activity, but we make sure that we're staffed up to handle it. So, we feel we're continuing to be on track.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. One last one on the expense front, I don't know if it's possible to launch a 2024 expense growth
expectation, yeah, it's a big year of cleaning up and you got a little extra on the cost savings on the deal in the
fourth quarter. But if – and maybe not, if you can't go into a figure, just talk about kind of big picture. I think you
kind of spoke to, Clint, sort of continuing to optimize is sort of the message, but any big picture sort of branch
consolidation or larger investments that may come in, in 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. We're always looking at how can we become more efficient and I do think that there's opportunities for us
to do that as we've already started, we're well into our 2024 planning process. So, that's what I was alluding to.
There, we're going to continue to invest, especially in our de novo markets and Chris and Tory have made some
strategic hires in existing markets, in Chris' prepared remarks, he mentioned California, Northern California. So,
8

we're going to continue to be opportunistic within legacy markets, but also invest in those newer markets, in those
high-growth markets. But we're going to challenge ourselves to do that by finding offsets and efficiencies in other
parts of our organization as opposed to just simply letting expenses ramp up. In terms of kind of a launch-point for
modeling purposes, I'm going to only defer to Ron on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. And Jeff, we'll talk about that with an updated guide in January as we look into 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And just curious on the – you said that cost saves are net of investment. Is there a ballpark number that
you'd pass along in terms of what you think you invested against the cost saves of $140 million?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, Jeff, this is Ron again. Yeah, it's actually a specific number, $21 million. So, we've got gross of $164 million
then down to $143 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
I was hoping maybe we could just touch on the funding side and specifically focusing on the core funding side,
exclusive of the broker deposit increases that we talked about earlier. I'm just curious what you're seeing there as
we dig in, it sounds like core trends are stabilizing that you're actually having some success attracting new clients,
which may be difficult for us to see in some regard, just given clients utilizing excess liquidity. I'm just curious
some of the underlying trends that you see there within your core deposit franchise where you're seeing the most
opportunity to drive core deposit growth and attract those new deposit clients and how new core deposit pricing is
trending.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
David, hi. This is Tory Nixon. I'll talk a little bit on the commercial side of the house and let Chris kind of chime in
on the consumer side of the house. For commercial banking, I mean, you're seeing just a few different things.
One, folks are using excess cash to invest in their companies when and where appropriate, rather than borrow.
So, the borrowing side is just less robust than it was a year ago. Folks are also kind of looking for yield where they
can with any excess deposit. We have done, I think, a really nice job connecting with our existing customer base
and just looking holistically at their relationship, and with that in mind, kind of focusing on where they may have
funds at other places and talking about bringing those funds to Umpqua Bank and have a lot of success with that.
That will continue without a doubt. We've had a lot of success this quarter with it. And we've got I think a really
nice pipeline as we kind of move into Q4. So, Chris?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, pretty much the same piece on that, David. I would add that on the new side, our rates are very competitive
in the market, but where we're really seeing the opportunities to deepen relationships is in talking with the
customers, taking them through our relationship model, asking questions about what else they have out there and
we continue to source deposits from other institutions. As well, the teams have really kind of moved towards –
there's still some minor integration, but not technology types of things. And our teams are out jointly calling
together in all of our markets and winning new business just with their outward-bound efforts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Sounds good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, David. Tory again, I thought I'd just add one more thing on there. One of the things kind of going on in our
marketplace is tremendous disruption from other financial institutions. And we're looking – we've got – it gives us
a lot of opportunity. And so, we're working hard in the markets in our footprint to talk to anybody and everybody do
we think that's the bank and having some success with that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
You bet. That's great. And maybe stepping back a bit, it seems like we're going to be in a higher-for-longer
environment for some time. I'm just curious maybe – and look, I know it's still early, but I'm just curious how you
10


Columbia Banking System, Inc.
(COLB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
think about maybe the margin trajectory and the business performance more broadly in a higher-for-longer
environment and how you're looking to manage the balance sheet and the business for that kind of environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, David. It's Ron. And again, I'll come back to comments we talked about earlier. Do we see continued
customer deposit growth? And I feel really good about where we're at in a higher-for-longer environment. I think
maybe in terms of 2024 specifically, we'll definitely give you an update on that in January and our view as we look
into the year. But it's going to be the basic blocking and tackling you heard Chris and Tory talk about continued
customer deposit growth, we'll look there on that front.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then last one from me, you guys have been accreting capital at a rapid pace, you're getting close to
your 12% total risk-based target. I'm just curious, as you approach those targets, how do you think about capital
management? Is there any interest in potentially returning capital maybe early next year or at this point in the
cycle, would you primarily be focused on capital preservation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, I think, our focus is we always want to be good stewards of capital. And we have our long-term targets and
we've spoken about those and been very consistent with those even on a standalone pre-merger basis our
thoughts around capital levels were pretty consistent. And so, essentially, at 150 basis points to whatever the
criteria is to be considered well capitalized and that's our long-term target. You know total risk-based capital has
been the constraint, you mentioned the 12%. Absolutely, we're going to look at all capital deployment
opportunities. I don't think that as soon as we hit like 12.01% or something that we're going to look at a major
shift, but if we're accreting 25 bps, 30 bps of capital a quarter, it happens pretty quickly, where then suddenly or
50 basis points, 75 basis points, 100 basis points over that target and still growing capital. We've mentioned that
with our forecast and expectations and the earnings power of this company that there's not a level of what we
think would be prudent organic growth that would absorb all of that capital. So by default, yes, we will be looking
at capital return and how we do that as we manage those ratios. Now, I don't think you should expect it next
quarter necessarily, but I do expect that it will be a nice problem that we'll have as 2024 progresses.

Okay. And then I guess as you look at your borrowing position, where is that today relative to where you want it to
be? And as that continues to mature, maybe just give us a schedule of how that matures and if the expectation is
to replace that with additional brokered?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. And again, the Home Loan Bank advances are also in that two to four-month tenor. So, they're all repriced
in that, call it, mid-5 area as well. And that just gives us the most flexibility, right? And back to your second
question, we're obviously sitting on more borrowings than we would like. It's in response to, of course, what's
happened with just liquidity drain in the overall system over the past year. Ideally, over time, deposit growth
continues to exceed loan growth. Customer deposit growth exceeds customer loan growth and we're able to pay
those down [indiscernible] (00:31:00).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And so the first question, it seems like the low end of the margin guide seems fairly
conservative. And I'm just wondering, as we look at NII, is that also kind of 50-50 for an inflection point next
quarter or even though there is some stability in the NIM, we could see another quarter of NII compression prior to
that higher-for-longer really kicking in and benefiting the top line in 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, specific to that question in Q4 and the guide, if we're talking about material move, it's going to
coming down again to customer deposit growth. I feel good about – you're not going to see a significant – you
should not see a significant change in the net interest income dollars, if we do have continued customer deposit
growth in the fourth quarter.

Okay. Okay. And then the FinPac early-stage plateauing last quarter, charge-offs still somewhat elevated this
quarter. So, focused on trucking, I guess, does that – is that more of a [ph] quarter one event (00:32:07) where
that pretty much subsides going forward? Or is that going to be more of a tail where this lingers for a couple of
additional quarters prior to subsiding?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A

It's going to be a slow reduction over time over multiple quarters to my best estimation.

Ronald L. Farnsworth A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And then the $515 million of prepayments, I just want to ask kind of like what was the success rate in kind
of maybe converting those into new originations this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. This is Tory, Brody. So, I'll be just real quick on that. I think the success rate is very, very high. That's what
we want to do. We had growth in the commercial side and our C&I teams of about $40 million or $50 million and
then growth in the CRE teams at about $180 million. So, a lot of success in the rollover of that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. And then could I ask just a generic question on the loan portfolio? What portion of it is shared
national credits? And then of that, what do you lead on?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
So, our total commitments in the SNC portfolio is around $3 billion. Our outstandings are roughly $1.8 billion. We
lead a couple deals today, but most of them are just a participation with ancillary business and it is not a part of
the organization that we are growing really at all. We have really strict guidelines of what we want to be in and
what we're going to do and it obviously has got to have significant ancillary business, including deposits, to even
consider.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And maybe just on the office portfolio, you give great detail there. But I was
wondering if you happen to have what the ALLL for the office portfolio was.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Brody. We choose not to provide that much detail surrounding ACL on that
portfolio, we feel that there's enough detailed information provided elsewhere for the group to really ascertain the
quality of our loan portfolios, which is high, very good quality.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Cool. And then I did want to ask – this was more of interest for me, just on the multifamily originations this
quarter, I just noticed that there was like a big difference I think between the debt service coverage ratios that you
had originated last quarter. I think they were like 1.7% and this quarter they were 1.32% and like that's still
healthy, but it was just a big difference. And so, I just want to know if there is anything specific that kind of caused
that.

Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Nothing specific, Brody. Without having that detail in front of me, it's hard for me to say. But what I would intimate
from this is that we had extremely strong sponsorship on those deals, and they were relationship-based
opportunities. So, we had the banking relationship and knew the client.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then I just have a couple last quick ones for you. Just on the non-accruals that I wanted to understand,
was any of that included in the delinquencies just because when I looked at the buckets that you disclosed on
page 20, I noticed that the DQ rates had kind of moved higher for owner occupied and C&I and mortgage and
then FinPac as well. I just wanted to make sure, was there any kind of overlap between the non-accrual moves
and the DQ moves?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Explain DQ moves.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
The delinquencies. So, the mortgage went from 0.43% to 0.59%, the C&I went from 0.3% to 0.6% on the total
delinquencies, owner occupied from 0.23% to 0.51%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Brody Preston Q

Okay. And then this is my last one, on the one that you talked about earlier where they just decided or I guess you
said they had been struggling for a bit and then they ceased operations, what was the collateral that was backing
that specific loan? And I guess, like, how does the workout process evolve here from when a business just
decides to shut down, kind of what are the steps look like?

That was an owner occupied commercial real estate piece of collateral. What we do initially obviously is we
downgrade it. We then get the property reappraised which did come in and I've said on these calls historically
about our lending discipline and our aversion to leverage. Well, it played out in this case because we got the
property reappraised. We still have equity in the property. And we continue to work with the borrower on trying to
structure an orderly way out of this. We will not take a loss on this piece of property.

Great. Thanks. Ron, I'm starting on slide 10, the rate disclosures. So, I think somebody had asked before about
higher-for-longer, you do have, I guess, a back book narrative. So, I guess I'm interested in a little bit more color
in a higher-for-longer environment, your views like in terms of the opportunity to defend margin, I guess, is the first
question. The second question is, I know you provided the spot deposit rate, do you have the September margin?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yes, September margin was within a couple of bps of the Q3 margin. And just back to the first part of the
question, again, I think it was around the loan replacement maturity schedule, higher rate environment for longer,
et cetera, again, [ph] the seasonal downtick (00:39:53) and we continue to be successful at growing customer
deposit balances. That is going to be one of the single biggest drivers in terms of where our [indiscernible]

Hi, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
A question for you on just the deposit flows during the quarter. It seems like deposit growth is back and so, Ron,
I'll take the over on customer deposit growth. But what was the difference between Q3 and Q2? I think some of us
were disappointed in the Q2 deposit growth and this is obviously rebounded. But what's driving these increases,
is it rate driven or something else?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I think there's a little bit of both in there. As far as the market has calmed down somewhat, as far as the rapid
increase in rates, we didn't see as much of that in the third quarter. We're farther past our initial conversion and
things of that nature where I'll just say it again that our teams are out in the markets, winning new business, using
the expanded capabilities that we have. And when you put those things together, the value proposition really
comes to play of we've got great bankers that are externally oriented and they're doing it in a collaborative
manner and that allows us to keep our deposit costs down, but we're also winning business. And when you win
operating accounts, it helps keep it down as well. But some of it is just, say, it's the stability of the rate
environment and that it – yeah, we start seeing increases during the quarter and move past some of the issues
that happened in March as well. And I won't say business as usual, but it's a whole lot calmer.
And Tory, I don't know if you want to add anything.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No. I think that's very well said. I think it's all those things and it's a real outbound focus by all of our teams to
connect with our customers and connect with prospects and bring business into the bank and realizing that the
most important business we bring in the bank is on the deposit front.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. The other thing I'll add to that is there is an element of seasonality and it's a little murky, more so than what
it has been historically in terms of isolating the seasonality. But I do believe there was some seasonality and it's
pretty easy for us to track new relationships that we're bringing in, in particular on the commercial side. But the
seasonality aspect I think also played a role, and then kind of as a continued headwind is consumers are still
pressured and the impact of inflation and I'm not sure, necessarily what this translates to where you're at, Jon. But
I filled the car up the other day and it was $6.50 a gallon, so you think about $175 to fill your SUV up, that takes a
bite out of a lot of consumers. And so, I think we're still seeing the impact of inflation on that aspect. Fortunately,
we lead a lot with the commercial and the operating account side. And we're seeing great success in winning new
business and bringing in additional aspects of existing relationships on that front.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. That's very helpful. I don't know if this is you Clint or Tory, but can you comment on the overall
lending pipeline? Are they changing at all? And what's a comfortable pace of loan growth for the company?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. This is Tory. The loan pipeline is down just a touch from last quarter, but it's actually pretty strong still and
fairly robust. So, I feel good about the mix in the pipeline and actually the size of the pipeline throughout the
footprint. I think Clint mentioned earlier our de novo offices of Utah, Colorado and Arizona. We've got some really
nice pipelines there, which is great to see. And I feel good about that. I think we're still probably a low to mid-
single digit in loan growth for the bank. Pipelines for deposits are nice and the fee income is really strong, which is
kind of an, I think, connection to the conversation that Chris and I both said about connection with clients and
prospects and looking at a bunch of different solutions to solve – to help customers thrive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. The one thing I don't think that the pipeline, the absolute level of the pipeline tells the whole story because
of we're being very disciplined and focused on the types of loans and the types of relationships that we're
pursuing, and so where maybe in outside of a quantitative tightening environment, we might have done more in
terms of real estate and things like that. So the types of jump in here, Chris or Tory, if you feel differently, but the
types of loans that we're really interested in the pipeline and the activity that our bankers are servicing is really,
really solid.

Good afternoon.

Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Ron, just a quick one on the cash balances. Should we expect any more normalization from this, call it, $1.9
billion level? Or is this kind of the right level to think about the cash balance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Again, that'll come down to customer deposit flows as I talked about earlier. So ideally, you're going to see us
continue to more normalize that to a lower level, probably somewhere in the mid-1 range, but not sure if that will
occur by Q4 or not, but that's ultimately where I'd expect it to settle.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then on the deposit flows specifically within the quarter, on the non-interest bearing side, do you see
most of the balance contraction occur earlier in the quarter or was it pretty ratable throughout the quarter? And
then just to put a fine point on the margin and the customer deposit balance discussion, if we see 4Q deposit
trends from a core perspective look similar to 3Q that would put you at the top end of the full year margin
guidance, correct?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
On the first question, yeah, that was ratable over the course of the quarter. There was no specific shock. And I
think again, back to – Clint talked about earlier on the consumer side, driven by just continued inflation, the
majority of that decline there. In terms of Q4 in the guide, you're spot on, right? So, if we do better on that front in
Q4, we're in the upper end, a little less than [indiscernible] (00:48:50), but feel good about where we're at ballpark
going into it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then on the FinPac portfolio, it looks like the delinquencies in that book moved from, I think I recall,
nearly 6% last quarter down to low 4% this quarter. I guess, should we expect to see the commensurate kind of
move lower in charge-offs heading into the fourth quarter? I guess just like magnitude-wise or I guess, do you
think they'll hang around this 5% kind of charge-off level for a while?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I think in the fourth quarter, I think it's going to be pretty stagnant. That's what I would say. Again and fourth
quarter is historically the most difficult quarter to collect in that business and that just coupled with the – just the
overall economic headwinds that truly impact these most susceptible companies. I think it's going to be pretty
stagnant in the fourth quarter, but I think the trucking will continue to gradually decline. It's just going to take a
while. It's going to take a few quarters to get to more normalized level in that space.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. Got it. And then the last question I have is just following up on the SNC discussion, I think you said
you've got a $1.8 billion outstanding in syndicated loans. And I realize some of the rationale there, it sounded like
was the rationale for participation was deposit driven. Do you have a similar level or I guess is that $1.8 billion of
SNCs fully funded with deposits generated by those relationships or is there a greater deposit sponsorship that
comes with it? Or is it less? Just any more color there would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. No, this is Tory. Just by nature of that part of the borrowing apparatus, there's less deposits associated with
that than there is loan outstandings. So it's just a byproduct of participating in a large credit. But with that in mind,
I mean, what we do have, we've had for a longer period of time and we have a very strong connection to
management and to the companies, and we have, in almost all cases, ancillary business, whether that's some
sort of fee income business and/or deposits.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, good afternoon, all. Just a couple of questions on credit, classified up 15 basis points I think to 1.28%. And it
looks like you built reserves, C&I reserves by about $22 million. Just want some additional color behind the
increase in classified and then not only that, but just the increase in C&I related reserves.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, Matt. The increase in classifieds was really driven by a migration from special mentioned into the
classified loan status. And it's really centered in the commercial book of business. And again, these are the two
properties that – not properties, but the two commercial borrowers that I mentioned that just continued to struggle
and we had to downgrade them into classified status and that's the bulk of that change. And as far as the building
of the reserve, I mean, the you see the FinPac continues to have elevated charge-offs. We've got the increase in
classified loans and the Moody's baseline economic forecast continues to move in the direction that warrants
building of the reserve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Okay. Yeah. I was actually speaking to the $16 million, not $22 million, $16 million increase in C&I. Okay.
And then just on the overall reserve, I think last quarter, there was an expectation that maybe reserve coverage
kind of trends lower toward 1%, but went the other way this quarter. Just any updated thoughts and obviously
macro assumptions change and the environment changes. But any updated thoughts on the overall reserve
coverage going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
