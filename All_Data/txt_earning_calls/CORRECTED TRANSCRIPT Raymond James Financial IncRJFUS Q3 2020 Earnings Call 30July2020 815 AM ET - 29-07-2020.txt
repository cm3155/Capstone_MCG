Paul Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thanks, Kristie, and good morning, everyone, and thanks so much for joining us. This is our second call during
the COVID crisis, and with the first one we were a little more geographically scattered, so technology and
Internet's willing and able, we're hopeful to have a good call here. I'm really proud of how the firm has performed
during this period with the COVID crisis, the social justice issues, our associates and advisors have been
amazing.
The advisors have focused on their clients, growing their business with great net new asset numbers, our
associates have really worked hard to support them and all of Raymond James has come together to discuss and
make commitments on the social justice issue. In August is Raymond James' Cares month to see how we're
helping those needy and smaller groups [ph] virtually is (00:03:03) really inspiring.
In getting into the numbers, despite lower short-term interest rates and economic uncertainty associated with
COVID-19, I'm really pleased with the results for the third quarter. Fixed income generated record revenues and
pre-tax income, PCG assets in fee-based accounts increased 16% sequentially and we continue to recruit
numerous high-quality financial advisors, reaching a new record of 8,155, up 251 over June of 2019.
We recruited 113 financial advisors domestically during this quarter alone, which represents $71 million of trailing
12 production at their prior firms, all of this during the pandemic and with our offices closed for much of that
period. We are also entering the fourth quarter of a healthy investment banking pipeline. Even with these market
changes and uncertainty, we are continuing to focus on servicing our advisors and clients, and growing all of our
businesses.
We generated quarterly net revenue of $1.83 billion, which was down 5% as compared to prior year's fiscal third
quarter and 11% compared to the preceding quarter. The year-over-year decline in quarterly net revenues was
largely driven by the impact of short-term interest rates as we all know, both on net interest income and RJBDP
fees from third-party banks.
Sequentially, quarterly net revenues declined due to both short-term interest rates and lower asset management
and related administrative fees, which were primarily based in the Private Client Group entering the quarter with
fee-based accounts so lower. We generated quarterly net income of $172 million or $1.23 per diluted share,
which was down 34% compared to net income in the prior year's fiscal third quarter largely due to the bank loan
loss provision of $81 million during the quarter compared to a $5 million benefit in the prior year's fiscal third
quarter.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 30-Jul-2020
Despite a sequential decline in quarterly pre-tax income, net income increased 2% sequentially as significant non-
taxable gains in the corporate-owned life insurance portfolio reduced the effective tax rate to 13.1% for the quarter
from 29.3% in the preceding quarter. On an annualized basis, our return on equity for the quarter was 10% and
return on tangible common equity or ROTCE was 10.9%.
Moving to slide 4, as equity markets rebounded from the March lows, client assets under administration grew 13%
sequentially to $877 billion and PCG assets in fee-based accounts grew to 16% sequentially to a near record
$443 billion which will provide significant tailwinds for asset management fees in the fiscal fourth quarter.
Following the surge in March, client cash balances remained relatively stable ending the quarter at $51.9 billion.
And despite the continued disruption caused by travel restrictions and office closures, we reached a record
number of PCG financial advisors of 8,155, 251 over June of 2019 and 7 over March of 2020. This is a good
result compared to many firms which experienced a net decline.
We accomplished this despite many of these offices being closed during the quarter and we've had many
advisors commit – push their commitment dates back waiting for the offices to reopen. Net bank loans of $21.2
billion grew 3% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter, but declined 3% compared to the preceding quarter. The
sequential decline includes proactive sales of corporate loans totaling $355 million which we'll discuss in more
detail in the call. The bank continued to experience healthy growth in residential mortgages and security-based
lending to our private client group clients.
Moving to segment results starting on the slide 5, the Private Client Group generated quarterly net revenues of
$1.25 billion. Quarterly net revenues declined 8% compared to prior year's fiscal third quarter and primarily due to
lower RJBDP fees from third-party banks, a decline in net interest income and lower brokerage revenues.
The 16% sequential decline in quarterly net revenues was attributable to the aforementioned items as well as
lower asset management fees and related administrative fees which were primarily based on Private Client Group
assets and fee-based accounts being lower at the beginning in the quarter.
Quarterly pre-tax income for the segment was down $91 million, down 35% on a year-over-year basis and 46%
sequentially. PCG assets increased along with the equity markets and while recruited production increased
sequentially, the net addition of financial advisors was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, which
disrupted a lot of the transitions particularly in the employee channel due to office closures and slowed the net
addition of trainees as testing centers were closed during the quarter, but are now open.
It's also important to note that in the net number, a number of advisors leaving for retirements, leaving the industry
or moving to a RIA channel affect the total net advisor count. But we've retained almost all of those assets during
those transitions. The net advisory growth in the independent channel remains strong and is tracking closely with
our fiscal 2019 results. As home office visits for perspective advisors have transitioned to 100% to virtual, advisor
recruiting activity has continue to recover and the pipeline remains solid across all of our affiliation options.
Over the past four quarters financial advisors representing approximately $290 million of trailing 12 productions
and nearly $43 billion of assets with our prior firms have affiliated with Raymond James domestically, which is a
very strong result.
Moving to slide 6, the Capital Markets segment generated record revenues driven by higher fixed income
brokerage revenues, debt underwriting revenues, which more than offset lower M&A revenues. The 71% year-
over-year increase in fixed income brokerage revenues and the record results for our fixed income really reflect

our leading position in the small to mid-sized depository client segment, which has experienced an increase in
activity. Meanwhile, M&A revenues declined due to economic uncertainty and decreased activity across certain
industries. However, clients remain engaged and the fourth quarter pipeline looks good.
On the next slide, the Asset Management segment generated net revenues of $163 million and pre-tax income of
$60 million during the quarter. Financial assets under management grew to $145.4 billion, increases of 2% on a
year-over-year basis and 13% sequentially, primarily attributable to the higher equity markets as the S&P index
appreciated 20% during the quarter, which was partially offset by net outflows for Carillon Tower Advisers.
On slide 8, Raymond James Bank generated net revenues of $178 million or 15% decline from the preceding
quarter largely attributable to the 73-basis-point decline in the bank's net interest margin during the quarter,
reflecting the rapid and significant decline of LIBOR. Pre-tax income of $14 million declined 90% to the prior fiscal
third quarter and was flat sequentially. The year-over-year decline in the pre-tax income was primarily due to the
$81 million bank loan loss provision during the quarter.
On slide 9, we can look at the history of Raymond James Bank's key credit metrics during the financial crisis. You
can see that Raymond James Bank, consistent with the entire banking industry, enjoyed several years of positive
credit trends since the financial crisis. While non-performing assets declined during the quarter net charge-offs
were $72 million including $61 million related to proactive sales of corporate loans during the quarter.
The other $11 million of charge-offs were attributable to one corporate loan. The allowance for loan losses as a
percentage of total loans increased to 1.56% from 1.47% in the preceding quarter. And for the corporate
portfolios, the allowance for loan loss as a percentage of C&I loans ended the quarter at 2.4% and for CRE loans
2.8%. If economic conditions continue to deteriorate we would expect adding to these reserves, but certainly the
outlook is uncertain.
Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on slide 10, we generated record net revenues of $5.91 billion during the
first nine months of the fiscal 2020 up 3% over the same period. Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset
Management segments generated record net revenues and Capital Markets and Asset Management segments
generated record pre-tax income during the first nine months of the fiscal year.
Again these results highlight the advantage of our diverse complementary businesses. Earnings per diluted share
of $4.33 declined 18% compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower interest rates and
higher bank loan loss provisions.
And now for more detailed review of the financials, I'm going to turn it over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?

Paul Shoukry

Thanks, Paul. Starting with revenues on slide 12. As Paul stated, we generated quarterly net revenues of $1.83
billion which are down 5% on a year-over-year and 11% sequentially. I'll touch on a few of the revenue line items.
Asset management fees were down 1% on a year-over-year and 14% sequentially, commensurate with the
sequential decrease in fee-based assets in the [Technical Difficulty] (00:14:19 to 00:14:24) the fiscal third quarter
which will be reflected in the fourth quarter as these assets are built at the beginning of each quarter based on
balances at the end of the preceding quarter, but remember the Asset Management line is also driven by financial
assets under management which increased 13% sequentially.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 30-Jul-2020
Account and service fees of $134 million declined 27% year-over-year and 22% sequentially, primarily reflecting
the decrease in RJBDP fees from third-party banks due to lower short-term interest rates which I'll detail shortly.
And jumping down to other revenues, they were up substantially from the preceding quarter as the second quarter
included valuation losses of $39 million associated with our private equity investments, largely due to the equity
market decline last quarter.
Moving to slide 13, clients' domestic cash sweep balances which are the primary source of funding for interest
earning assets and the balances with third-party banks that generate RJBDP fees, ended the quarter at $51.9
billion, representing 6.6% of domestic PCG client assets, as client assets increased substantially while cash
balances remained relatively stable throughout the quarter following the surge in March.
And as we've mentioned on the prior quarter's call, we've shifted about $4 billion of cash balances from Raymond
James Bank to third-party banks in April. But as we look forward, we will likely redeploy a portion of these
balances back to the bank over time as we plan on continuing purchases of agency-backed securities which
ended the quarter at $5.6 billion and we will also resume corporate loan growth when there is less market
uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.
On slide 14 the top chart displays our firm wide net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks on a
combined basis as these two items are directly impacted by changes in short-term interest rates. As you can see
the rate cuts totaling 225 basis points since August of 2019 have put significant pressure on these revenue
streams which on a combined basis are down $120 million compared to the prior year's fiscal third quarter despite
loan growth at Raymond James Bank and a significant year-over-year increase in client cash balances. Given
that these revenues are not directly compensable the significant decline has created headwinds for a
compensation ratio and pre-tax margins as we will discuss on the next few slides.
On the bottom of slide 14, it shows our bank's NIM decreasing to 2.29% this quarter. This sequential decline was
predominantly caused by the rapid decline in LIBOR which is about lower now than it was during the last earnings
call. Based on LIBOR at the current level, we would expect the Bank's NIM to decline to 2.1% to 2.2% over the
next quarter or two which will also be impacted by how quickly we grow the securities portfolio at Raymond James
Bank.
On the bottom right portion of the slide you can see that the average yields on RJBDP fees from third-party banks
fell to an average of 33 basis points during the quarter as we expected. We would expect average yields to
remain close to 30 basis points over the near-term. So, when we think about bank NIM going forward as we shift
more cash from third-party banks to Raymond James Bank to [Technical Difficulty] (00:17:47-00:17:54) even
though we would earn more on a consolidated basis.
For example, today, we earn around 30 basis points with third-party banks as I just described. And we are earning
around 1% on new securities purchases at the bank, so somewhere around a 65-basis-point pickup for the firm,
net of FDIC insurance expense. But of course we are taking some duration risk and tying up some capital in
return for that benefit.
Moving on to expenses on slide 15; first, compensation expense, which is by far our largest expense. The
compensation ratio increased sequentially from 68.8% to 69.6% during the quarter. The compensation ratio was
negatively impacted by a higher proportion of compensable revenues as lower interest rates negatively impacted
the non-compensable revenue streams we discussed on the last slide. Partially offsetting that negative impact
was a lower compensation ratio in the Capital Markets segment, thanks to very strong fixed income brokerage
revenues.

On to non-compensation expenses; non-compensation expenses during the quarter of $359 million decreased
sequentially due to a lower loan loss provision and lower business development expenses as travel and
conferences were halted by COVID-19.
Taking a step back for a moment, when we entered the year, we were well-positioned for market and economic
disruptions and continued to effectively serve advisors and clients throughout the pandemic and resulting
economic disruption. Our success weathering this difficult period has been enabled by the significant investments
in our infrastructure over the past several years. However, the unexpected swing in interest rates and the
uncertainty that comes with a global recession require us to evaluate ways to reduce costs and find efficiencies to
remain well-positioned for future growth and success.
To that end, we are currently engaged in a firm-wide process of evaluating both compensation and non-
compensation expenses to improve efficiency, while maintaining our high service standards. Importantly, we plan
to continue making growth investments during this period. For example by recruiting financial advisors and other
revenue generating producers, we also continue investing in our support platform, robotic automation and
integrated and paperless processes to continue enhancing the advisor-client experience.
Based on lessons learned during this crisis, we also anticipate our real estate needs will evolve as we consider
more flexible strategies over the long-term. So while we are far along in this process, we are not prepared to
provide any efficiency targets, guidance or timelines on the call today. But the goal is for these initiatives to yield
significant efficiencies for the firm which is critical so that we can continue investing in growth.
Slide 16 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. Pre-tax margin was 10.8% in the fiscal third
quarter of 2020 negatively impacted by lower short-term interest rates and the large bank loan loss provisions.
On slide 17 at the end of the fiscal third quarter, total assets were approximately $45 billion, declining 10%
sequentially. This decrease was primarily attributable to shifting client cash balances from the bank to third-party
banks following the surge in March as I discussed earlier.
Our liquidity remains very strong. Cash at the parent was more than $2 billion and we also have an undrawn $500
million unsecured committed revolver which doesn't mature until 2024. So right now we have about $1 billion of
excess cash at the parent over our conservative targets, but we are intentionally maintaining even more cash than
we typically hold given in the high degree of market uncertainty. So with cash at the parent of more than $2 billion,
a total capital ratio of 26% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 14.5%, we have substantial amounts of capital liquidity
with plenty of flexibility to be both defensive and opportunistic.
Slide 18 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters where we returned approximately
$709 million back to shareholders through dividends and repurchases under the board's authorization. Share
buybacks have been suspended since mid-March and $537 million remains available under the board's previously
disclosed repurchase authorization.
With our strong capital and liquidity position, we plan on maintaining our current dividend and we also likely will
resume share repurchases of up to $50 million per quarter just to offset the share-based compensation dilution,
but we will still wait for more market clarity before we do a larger amount of opportunistic repurchases.
On the next two slides we provide additional detail on the bank's loan portfolio. Slide 19 provides some detail on
Raymond James Bank's asset composition. In the pie chart, you can see we have a really well-diversified portfolio

with a focus over the past few years to really grow residential mortgages and securities-based loans to Private
Client Group clients as well as significantly increase the size of the securities portfolio.
We have not yet set a new target, but we do plan on continuing purchases of these securities which are mostly
agency-backed. So we have a much more diversified portfolio now than we did before the last financial crisis. And
within each category we have a significant amount of diversification as well as you can see on this slide.
As we talk about on the next slide, our concentration in some of these COVID exposed industries have decreased
sequentially as we proactively sold certain loans. This slide includes some other facts and statistics on other loan
categories, but in summary we feel good about the bank's loan portfolio. With that being said, it is important to
remember that we are still in the middle of a global pandemic. So as confident as we are about the composition of
the loan portfolio and our loan underwriting and monitoring processes, we have to acknowledge that we could
experience significant credit deterioration if economic conditions continue to deteriorate.
Moving on to slide 20; during the quarter, we opportunistically sold $355 million of corporate loans associated with
industries that we believe are most vulnerable to the COVID-19 crisis. Having a secondary market to proactively
reduce credit exposures is a real advantage of our C&I lending strategy. The average selling price of these loans
was round 82% of par value which resulted in charge-offs of $61 million during the quarter, but we believe
proactively taking that hit to reduce our credit exposure and downside in the most vulnerable sectors over the
long-term is prudent given the high degree of economic uncertainty.
We plan to continue selectively selling corporate loans in the secondary market to further reduce our exposure to
certain sectors. Thus far in July, we have sold approximately $100 million of corporate loans in these sectors at
an average price of 93% of par value, as prices in the secondary market have continued to improve significantly.
Before I turn it over to Paul for his closing comments, I want to remind everyone that after much consideration, we
postponed the analyst Investor Day again. Given the continued economic and market uncertainty around the
COVID-19, it makes it difficult for us to provide much be meaningful forward-looking commentary, so we do not
want to waste your time.
However, we know analysts and investors have been asking us to disclose net new assets and since we [ph]
intend (00:25:37) on providing that at our analyst Investor Day, I'll go ahead and cover that now. As you can
imagine technology priorities have shifted significantly since the COVID pandemic, but we have been able to
make some good progress on this metric, thanks to the fantastic team working on it.
But it'll still take us some more work before we would consider providing this metric on a regular basis. We define
net new assets as total domestic, again domestic PCG client inflows, which includes financial advisor recruiting
less total domestic PCG client outflows. Inflows also include dividend reinvestments and interest, while outflows
include commissions and fee-based payments.
Fiscal year-to-date, we have generated net new assets of $41 billion, an annualized growth rate of 7.3%. We
believe this impressive result even during the COVID pandemic reinforces that Raymond James is one of the
industry's leaders in growing organically.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?

Great. Thanks, Paul. And I know there's a lot to cover on this call. So I'll get through a little outlook and we'll open
for questions. So, as for the outlook, we will continue to face headwinds from lower short-term interest rates and
the uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Private Client Group, our financial advisor recruiting
pipeline is strong across all of our affiliation options, and the segment's going to benefit by starting the fiscal fourth
quarter with a 16% sequential increase of assets and fee-based accounts. And just to note in that recruiting that
we've had a lot of people who have committed much earlier in the March, April, May timeframe who have deferred
their openings and moving before they joined because of the pandemic. So hopefully those will show up this
coming quarter also.
In the Capital Markets segment, despite muted M&A activity in the fiscal third quarter, clients remain engaged and
we have a pretty healthy investment banking pipeline. So, we wouldn't be surprised to see an improvement in the
M&A revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter, if the market remains relatively stable. And fixed income and brokerage
revenues have remained strong thus far in July. So it's always difficult to repeat the record like last quarter, but we
view them to be very, very – another strong quarter for that segment again given the market trends.
In Asset Management, results will be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management as long as
the equity market continues to remain resilient. And at Raymond James Bank, we expect NIM to decline as Paul
said from 2.29%. The fiscal third quarter is somewhere around between 2.1% and 2.2% over the next two
quarters reflecting current LIBOR rates and a higher mix of agency-backed securities.
Now remember when we move cash from our third-party banks to the bank and agency-backed securities, the
bank NIM will go down, but we'll generate overall for the firm higher interest income and therefore we think it
represents an attractive risk adjusted return for the firm.
We are continuing to sell certain corporate loans as Paul mentioned and we've been very selective in making new
corporate loans given the high degree of uncertainty, but we're continuing to do some new corporate loans, but
continuing to originate residential and securities-based loans to our Private Client Group clients. We have
significant capacity and appetite to resume corporate loan growth when we have more economic certainty. With
our substantial amount of capital and liquidity we are confident in our ability to withstand a severe downturn, while
being opportunistic and front-footed as things stabilize.
Our growth opportunities remain unchanged, always retaining and recruiting organically financial advisors in our
Private Client Group. And as you've heard from Paul a few minutes ago, our organic Private Client Group
domestic annualized net new asset growth of 7.3% has been strong despite the COVID challenges.
Additionally, we are committing and continue to add senior talent in other businesses such as investment banking.
We also continue to pursue acquisitions actively, economic softness typically surfaces attractive acquisitions as it
was during Morgan Keegan in 2012, a little more complicated by COVID and traveling and those kind of issues.
I also want to address social unrest following the tragic death of George Floyd during the quarter. At Raymond
James, we've always been a firm focused on social justice and being a good home for all associates and advisors
regardless of their race, gender or sexual orientation. But the recent social unrest really emphasized the need for
us to be even more vocal in public with our advocacy.
We just didn't want to write a check, but rather wanted to use financial commitments to activate our associates to
really make a difference. So that and in addition to our financial commitment, we released a pledge to the Black
community which was signed, not just by me but all members of our executive committee, our operating
committee and our board of directors as well as many other associates across the firm.

One major component of that pledge is to increase Black diversity throughout the firm, which will require
significant effort that we know will not be achieved overnight, but we are absolutely committed to delivering on this
pledge. And I just want to thank our leadership team, our Black Financial Advisors Network and our Mosaic
Inclusion Network Group for all their contributions and those to the so many associates who've raised their hand
and say I want to help to make a difference.
Before we open the lines for questions, I just want to add I believe we are well-positioned with our diversified
business mix, long-term focus and conservative principles to really emerge from this pandemic. With our strong
capital and liquidity positions, we are proactively pursuing strategic acquisitions with a consistent and disciplined
approach. Lastly I want to thank all of our associates and our advisors again for their invaluable contributions
during these trying times and their focus on serving clients.

First question here just on the net interest income outlook, if we can maybe the next couple of years, if we were to
hold LIBOR steady, I appreciate the NIM is going to see pressure just on the remixing of the bank that's going to
be, I think partially a function of how fast the securities book rose.
And so I'm just trying to think about parameters around how much you would move from third-party banks and
how quickly – how much, as we look beyond maybe even the upcoming quarter, the corporate book could shrink
further? And then are there other loan areas that could grow reasonably that could maybe provide a little bit of an
offset on the NIM like residential mortgages or something else?

Yeah. Well it's going to be hard to provide guidance over the next one or two years Devin, but at least for the next
one or two quarters, we think the guidance of NIM of 2.1% to 2.2% is our best guess right now based on where
LIBOR is. We haven't set a new target yet for how much we're willing to grow the securities portfolio. There's a lot
of variables there and frankly making a total shift in asset strategy in the middle of a global pandemic is probably
not the right time to do it with all of the moving parts.
Cash has been resilient, client cash balances are actually still $52 billion now roughly, even after income tax
payments and the fee billing in early July or mid-July. But that could change tomorrow, so certainly not willing to
go out one to two years. But as far as the corporate loan growth goes it was down I think $700 million net during
the quarter.
We sold $355 million worth, but there was also a lot of net pay downs and we remain very selective in making
new corporate loans. But as we get more market clarity, we certainly have an appetite and the expertise to grow
that portfolio and we can do it pretty rapidly if the market conditions get better. So, again a lot of moving parts;
can't go out one to two years, but at least over the next one or two quarters we think 2.1% to 2.2% NIM is as good
as it gets as we have right now.

Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Let me just add the one thing, I know you understand this stuff. But as we do move more from BDP to the bank
the NIM may have a little compression, but our overall net interest income will be up, will pick up 60 plus basis
points on that move net of insurance. So, the NIM may be down, but overall, net interest income will be up given
today's environment. So, that's the reason we would do it, we think it's a good risk adjusted return.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Right. And just a clarification because I know historically there's been parameters around the amount of cash
you're comfortable having essentially liquid and with third-party banks with a short duration versus in the bank,
which historically was more of a loan-centric bank. And so, as you're building more of a securities portfolio and
growing that, are you more comfortable, just given the more liquid nature of the securities to, kind of, I guess, go
beyond historical parameters around the mix of cash held outside the firm?

Yeah. I mean I think so we grew the securities portfolio net over $1 billion this quarter. Last time we were in zero
rate environment, we had almost no securities at all. So, our appetite for some duration has increased, but we're
still going to be more exposed to the shorter end of the curve, which is appropriate given our deposits are floating
rate deposits for the most part. And so, we'll continue moving deposits from third-party banks to the Bank's
balance sheet. But we want to do it in a way that [Technical Difficulty] (00:36:49).

announced here. You went through some of the areas that you're going to kind of continue to invest in and areas
that you want to kind of hold expenses. It sounds like in, do you have any high level thoughts right now just
around some of the areas where some of those efficiencies could exist within comp or non-comp? And then, just
any thoughts on timing around the conclusion and execution of it.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. I was wondering so if we look at your pre-tax margins for this quarter and exclude the elevated
provision number [indiscernible] (00:38:09) roughly a 15% number for this quarter? And then, maybe there is
another 1% or so of headwind from additional NIM pressure that you see, is that a good way of thinking about
your long-term pre-tax margins as a starting point, in this rate environment? And then maybe as we're modeling it
[ph] take in (00:38:32) some benefit from the expense initiatives that you're looking at?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think; in fairness we also had subdued business development expenses this quarter. I think they were
down something like $30 million year-over-year. This is typically the quarter where we hit our high watermark, just
given the timing of our recognition events and conferences.
So, there's some offsets and also Capital Markets generated I think a 19% pre-tax margin which is a very high
margin thanks to the record fixed income results, so there are some puts and takes. Again we're not ready to
provide, given the uncertainty in these moving parts, a long-term margin target. But we are focused on those
expense efficiencies as well, as you said.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And I guess on the provision side, can you give us an update on how you're thinking about provisions of
the Bank. And I know you mentioned that you could have a little bit more of a build if the environment
deteriorates, but if it doesn't, are you comfortable with where the reserve levels are at the Bank right now. And I
know you're not accounting on CECL yet, but maybe if you can give any initial guidance on what do you think the
CECL true-up will look like at the end of next quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
We try to be as proactive as we can, as we always do with reserving the loans, for the loans at the bank. So, we
feel good about our allowances now at – especially in the corporate portfolio, C&I is 2.4% allowance and the CRE
portfolio is a 2.8% allowance.
So with that being said, if economic conditions continue to deteriorate, then some of the stimulus measures which
are temporary in nature don't get extended. And who knows what's going to happen. So, there's certainly potential
for more allowances across the entire industry, but at this juncture we just don't know right now. So CECL goes
into effect October 1st. Frankly, I don't even know what our provision is going to be in the September quarter
under our existing methodology, so we really aren't in a position to provide much guidance under CECL yet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would say. I would add one thing is that you have to recognize too, most financial institutions haven't been
selling loans. So, if you were to take the sales of those loans instead of selling them, just put a reserve against
them, our reserves would've been much higher.
So, we've been proactively de-risking areas that we think – in the transportation and hospitality and gaming, in
areas we think are – have more exposure. We've been actively reducing risk, but again had we just followed what
most of the industry did our reserves would have even been higher. So, we think for where we are. We've done a
good job of trying to stay up in the front. But again, it just depends on the outlook. In a steady state, we wouldn't
be adding. If the economy gets worse, we will add. So, we're just going to have to watch and it's just too
unpredictable right now.

Hi, Steven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So wanted to start off with just a question, Paul, on the strategy regarding loan portfolio sales. And as we look
ahead, how large is the remaining pool of loans that you are looking to evaluate for a potential sale? If you could
just speak to the time line also for when you'd look to execute those, and whether the increase in criticized loans
that we saw in the quarter, is that what's driving at least a decision to execute on some of those, or what's the, I
guess, the prevailing factors that are driving the strategy there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, probably not a shock for most people that Raymond James has taken a whole different approach. As
we just look at the industries that we think are very COVID-dependent and set on a risk reward basis, there are
loans that we are – in certain industries we're just not comfortable that we think there's more downside than
upside. So, one way to do it is just increase your reserves and increase your criticized loans on your balance
sheet, and just ride through it.
But that also limits your flexibility, both regulatorily and the drag long-term. And on those highly risk areas are the
ones we decided just to lighten our exposure. And so that's been our strategy if those loans perform better and
some of these industries don't go through prolonged bankruptcy restructurings, we will have made a bad long-
term bet.
If the case is that they're very long restructurings, it's going to be a tough [indiscernible] (00:43:51) we made a
good bet and we are willing to do that in what we viewed were the most at-risk industries. So, we're looking, we
have a list of about another $100 million of loans, again the market's been good that's why we lightened
[indiscernible] (00:44:06) 93% whether we would do those or go more I don't know we're evaluating that as we go
and looking at the pricing risk long-term versus reserves kind of trade-offs. And once again had we just added
them to the reserves we'd be more flexible, but we think it's the right thing to do from a risk structure basis. So we
started out of the box quickly we've slowed down a little bit but we're still looking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
[indiscernible] (00:44:40) Paul and just a follow-up from me regarding the securities portfolio. I was hoping you
could give us some sense as to how we should think about the potential pace of additional purchases? I know
you've been reluctant to commit to that, but also just given your historical reluctance I would say to take on
additional duration risk, why the willingness to take this on now during this COVID environment when the
incremental spread between taking on that additional duration risk on an agency security versus what you're
earning off-balance sheet at 70 basis points is actually relatively low relative to prior historical periods.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Well, we have a significant amount of cash with third-party banks now, $25 billion. So, we have more
capacity now than we've had historically. And frankly, the demand at third-party banks is continuing to evolve.
There was a significant demand in March, when there was a lot of revolver fundings and that dynamic has
changed, as you know. And so, that demand is not as strong as it was in March.

And so, we're willing to take some duration, not as much duration as many of our peers, but we're willing to take
some incremental duration for that yield pickup. But we haven't again set a glide path just yet. But we're
comfortable with that taking on some more duration. And we certainly – we hope we're wrong, but we certainly
don't think that short-term rates are going to increase anytime soon, especially after hearing Powell again
yesterday. So again, hopefully, we're wrong because we're still going to be much more exposed to the short end
of the curve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. And just one quick follow-up, if I may, just on the non-comps, you delivered a positive surprise there, given
the lower [indiscernible] (00:46:34) and other expense. We have been seeing similar trends at peers. So, putting
aside the future expense initiatives, I know you're not ready to speak to, how should we think about the
appropriate jumping off point for that non-comp ex-provision base, recognizing that T&E, conference spend is
going to be on pause for a sustained period of time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Well, excluding the kind of elevated provisions, we were guiding to about $325 million per quarter for this
fiscal year. And obviously, we've been well below that, excluding the provisions, largely due to, as you mentioned,
lower business development expenses, we want that, we expect that to go up over time, not next quarter, but as
soon as people are more comfortable traveling, we expect business development expenses to increase.
But one of the things that we're looking at as part of our overall expense initiatives is we've learned that a lot of
our advisors are perfectly comfortable and happy doing some of these regional workshops and other product-
focused sessions virtually versus physically in person at various locations across the country.
So the private client group leadership team is also looking at this as a long-term opportunity to certainly transition
to more virtual events as well which could help business development expenses. So again, we're looking closely
at the long-term opportunities coming out of this crisis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. But it'd be a mistake to think they're all going away. The conferences or get togethers there, the
educational trips for the top advisors are all part of our culture, and our ability to have feedback with our advisors.
So going forward, I think that we'll find there's a lot of trips, why would I take this two day trip, let's do it virtually,
but some of those conferences, we do anticipate coming back when it's safe to do so.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 30-Jul-2020
Thanks, guys. Paul, you mentioned a reinvestment rate around 100 basis points for agency MBS today. Is it fair to
assume that's ultimately where the yield on the entire securities book will go assuming static rates, and if so when
will you expect that to occur over what timeframe?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah I mean we have – an average duration of the securities we buy is roughly three years. And so the existing
books has an average yield of about 2%. And I'd say the average life on the existing book – remaining life is
probably two to three years because again the vintage is relatively new of the portfolio as we've grown it. So, it will
take some time for that reinvestment yield to sort of reset as we add securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Harris Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And just one quick question on the Asset Management segment, those revenues were down 11%
sequentially. And I know it is a volatile quarter in terms of AUM moving around, but that decline seems to be more
than potentially average AUM decline, so is there something else that's going on in that segment that dropped the
revenues a bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
That AUM, Chris, includes both institutional assets under management as well as retail assets under
management. So I would say roughly 65% of those assets are built based on the beginning of the period assets.
So, you can't just look at it on an average basis. So that's what's driving the variance that you're describing.

James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good morning guys. Just maybe a quick question on capital management, I understand the uncertainty is
holding you back, but how do you think – what are the markers you're looking for? Is it just do we have to wait for
a vaccine for you to feel comfortable putting capital to work? What are the markers, I guess, or is there macro
markers that you're looking at? And I guess as a ancillary, does that also mean that you're – as much as you want
to do acquisitions you're holding back to put capital to work there until you have clarity as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
So, I think in order of – we would have no qualms whatsoever doing an acquisition, if we had the right one. So, we
think we have plenty of capital and ability to do an acquisition for the right one and integrate it. So, we don't see –
that's not an issue. In terms of stock buybacks, we agreed that our goal is to go ahead and minimize dilution and
restart that program. But I think both given the uncertainty and honestly even – you have political and regulatory
pressure right now in stock buybacks, we don't think it's just really prudent to start that yet.

But more importantly, driven by the economics, if we do enter into a second round of COVID, issues like we're
seeing in the south, if we do have a really, really tough winter, we may need those. So, if we're buying or
producing asset, we're very comfortable doing that, but we're just going to be a little more conservative on outside
of dilution doing proactive stock buybacks in this pandemic time. So, whether that's the vaccine or ceiling trailing
off or people getting comfortable with the operating environment, I can't say, it's one of those things, I think, we'll
know when we feel it, but I can't give you an objective – this is the answer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q

Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe on the compensation in PCG. When I look at sort of FA compensation
to compensable revenues, the percentage did seem to drop quite a bit in the quarters which was a little surprising.
Am I just not thinking about that right? Is there something unusual there? Just trying to get a sense of that
sustainable, in terms of the lower payout.

Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of follow-ups. I guess if you look at
the loan book, can you guys talk about the size of loans that you are ultimately evaluating for sales. I know you
sold $355 million and you sold another $100 million so far this quarter. But what's the total amount of risk to your
loans that you are looking to potentially sell. What are the yields on those loans and maybe you can talk a little bit
about how these loans ultimately made their way on to your balance sheet whether these were originated or
purchased?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 30-Jul-2020
Yeah. So again, I said we had about another $100 million that we were looking at selling. And again these are risk
reward. These were loans that are syndicated loans and in January we had a [indiscernible] (00:54:58) the
lenders don't think so, we get them to show, go through the loan portfolio, the most leveraged, the least
performing.
And we really, once a year, do an evening on each section of the portfolio and [indiscernible] (00:55:14) through
what I call – it's almost like a flight simulator. We try to crash the pilot to see what they do. We really go through
and push really hard, how are these loans, how are they underwritten. And I'll tell you, I felt as good as I have in
10 years about the underwriting. I think they were underwritten well. They were strong. What we didn't underwrite
them for was a pandemic and places having zero revenue.
In January, we didn't say the airlines weren't going to fly, or nobody was going to fly, and no one was going to
travel, and hotels were going to shut down and restaurants were going to shut down. So, it's those areas, those
loans. I think the underwriting is strong. It's just we had a circumstance we've never seen in recent 100 years,
probably almost in the country. So, that's how they got on to the balance sheet. So, I don't blame our team. I think
they were very conservative. We're just in a very, very unusual time.
As Paul said, one of the advantages of the loans we did have is they were marked. We were able to sell them at
93% of par, the last $100 million. And then, some of those loans have reserves on top. So, the loss of selling is
even less than that. It might be 300 or 400 basis points. So, we just viewed the trade-off in the risk, so that next
$100 million we sold is more worth. It's much more worth to take the loss now than to hold on to the risk and hope
that they would turn around in what most people think is going to be a longer haul in the pandemic.
So, the yield is – I think is comparable to the rest of the loan portfolio. They weren't the highest yielding loans,
they were – when underwritten, some of them were lower yielding loans they were at high credits in industries that
just got hit really hard in the pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think just the range of the yield is somewhere around LIBOR plus 175 to LIBOR plus 300, the loans that
we sold, in that kind of range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Right. That makes sense. I guess my question ultimately is, is the $100 million that you mentioned is that a
cleanup and it's kind of down or are you guys will be looking to sell down one?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We're opened to selling down. I think what we've done is we've looked at – the loans that we were most
concerned of and they were really more concerned about the industry in some places, the credits, we were
aggressive on very quickly. I think the loans now are almost opportunistic. As loan pricing recovered, we said we
could get these credits off of our balance sheet with almost no loss and we decided to go ahead and do that.
So, they're more opportunistic and again we have $100 million that we're looking at, we've done $100 million and
it doesn't say we will do the $100 million, it doesn't say we won't do more. We'll do an evaluation. And again we've
made a handful of new loans too because we'd like the industry's spreads and the risks, so we just haven't

opened up widely but we are still opened on originating in the corporate portfolio too, but we're just a lot more
critical to make sure we think those are good loans given in the environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. Makes sense. Perfect. And just a quick follow-up, thanks for the net new asset disclosure, very good
to see you guys get that out there. I guess when you talk about the pipeline and the strong momentum you
continue to have in recruiting can you talk a little about the mix and how the mix might have changed between the
employee channel given the kind of the work from home dynamics and the independent channel. So, as you're
looking out the next 12 months and the assets that are going to come in into Raymond James, how does that mix
compare to historical employee versus independent levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. During the quarter, it was much stronger in the independent channel. And the reason is most of them have
their own branches and offices. So, there is no reason to put off a move, they can change. Honestly sometimes
it's actually easier right now, because clients are at home, you can find them to do the transition.
So, that has been more robust in the core than the employee channel. Having said that, the recruiting in the
employee channel and the commits have been good, but a lot of them have delayed because we shut our offices.
And we're now in the limited reopening, limiting the number of people in the branches.
And so, we now have – on a voluntary basis – so, we now have the offices open where people join [indiscernible]
(00:59:50) like we announced this week, and another one the week before. So we do have people joining, but we
have an awful lot of people that have decided to put off their joins, and a lot of them till September now, and some
of these have been signed up since April, May, June. They said they're coming, but they just don't want to
transition till they feel that they're in a comfortable spot to the pandemic. So that's the – so I think the employer
side will do a little catching up once people feel comfortable about going into an office.

Morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered. Just a quick one. On the fixed [ph] strength
(01:00:45), you noted continuing into July on the brokerage side. I mean most of the areas we look at; seems like
things are slowing down a little bit. So, maybe if you can just give us some color there. How your business is
holding up from a market share perspective as well, would be helpful. Thanks.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 30-Jul-2020
So I think that, there was a rush in fixed income both in repositioning and frankly for credit underwriting, debt
underwriting. And so I think you've seen that slow down a little bit, but a lot, we have a very leading position with
small and mid-sized banks. So, as loan activity has kind of slowed down, they have been investing more in
securities and redoing their securities.
So although, I think we're not – if you ask me to guess, it'd be hard to repeat last quarter's record. It's always hard
to repeat a record, but I think it's going to be very strong fixed income for us. And all signs so far show it's very
strong, so we expect another good quarter and we anticipate just on closings that, capital markets that the M&A
transactions will be up, but you never know for closings for an M&A deal, we can guess all you want, even with a
good pipeline, it's when they close and what gets in the way, so we feel pretty good about that segment for this
quarter and then in the Private Client Group segment and Asset Management since the assets are pegged, I
mean that should be a pretty good quarter too in terms of revenue increases for those.

Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Please
proceed with your question.

Craig Siegenthaler Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Good morning, everyone and hope you're all well and staying healthy. I wanted to start off with recruiting. Do you
have the number of gross or net number of financial advisors added in each of the months in the June quarter?
And if you don't, could you provide any commentary on how recruiting trended in the quarter as you adapted to
the virtual recruiting backdrop?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, we're not going to provide monthly or – we of course track that internally, but haven't provided that
externally yet. What I would tell you is what Paul said is that the recruiting momentum really rebounded
throughout the quarter as we've adjusted to our virtual home office visits and we are all doing, Paul's doing them,
and I'm doing them, the home office visits virtually and they're going pretty well. So, we feel really good about the
activity levels again across all our affiliation options. But, yeah, aren't going to provide month-to-month statistics
on those.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig Siegenthaler Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Got it. Thanks Paul. And just one follow-up on reserving; can you provide us some color or at least what to expect
from the CECL loan loss reserve bill that's coming in the October quarter? I think seasonally this one may be
different than the others. And I'm just interested in the underlying process relative to the reserve that was just
build in both the March and the June quarter.

Yeah. And again, we still have another quarter under the incurred loss process for provisions and we don't even
know what that's going to be yet. So, we'll have to wait and see. I know that even for the big banks the macro
assumptions are changing rapidly. So to [Technical Difficulty] (01:04:22) the macro assumptions and projections
are going to look like even in October, it seems like it's right around the corner, but every week things change
dramatically. So, we'll wait and see kind of how things progress between now and then.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig Siegenthaler Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thank you, Paul.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I think that the problem with – the problem with CECL is that the macros change all the time. I mean, if you
took a point in time today where you wouldn't see a huge change, but you don't know, right. So that could change
tomorrow. But right now instantaneous, if we did it today, we don't think there'd be a huge change.

Operator: And our final question for today comes from the line of William Katz of Citi. Please proceed with your
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Hi, everyone. This is actually [ph] Zoe (01:05:24) speaking on behalf of William Katz. So thank you for taking the
question. So would just appreciate some more color on July, like any kind of initial color on client engagement
metrics and flows?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for the question. It's a pretty broad one in terms of the client engagement across our businesses.
As Paul said in his outlook comments in the Private Client Group business, the fee-based assets should provide
us a tailwind for Asset Management revenues and recruiting activity remains healthy.
In Capital Markets segment, the M&A pipeline entering into the fourth quarter looks good. We expect M&A
revenues to be up assuming that the market environment remains relatively resilient here through the rest of the
quarter and the fixed income activity – hard to repeat a record, as Paul said. The depository client segment in
particular remains very engaged. So, we feel good about the client activity levels, but we'll provide more details as
we go along here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. Thank you.

all of us, but we really appreciate you taking the time. We'll try to provide as much color as we can and hopefully
get an Analyst Day scheduled as soon as we can as we get a little more color for this next month or so. So, thank
