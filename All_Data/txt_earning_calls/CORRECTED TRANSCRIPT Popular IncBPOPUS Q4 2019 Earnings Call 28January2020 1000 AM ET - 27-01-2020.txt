Q4 2019 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2020
Good morning and thank you for joining the call. Today's results reflect another solid quarter and an outstanding
year in which we achieved record core earnings. Before I discuss the highlights for 2019, I'm very pleased to
report that in January we announced a series of Planned Capital Actions that we intend to execute this year.
These actions include an increase in the company's quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 to $0.40 per
share, beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and a common stock repurchase program of up to $500 million.
We also announced the redemption of our 8.25% Series B preferred stock, of which $28 million is currently
outstanding.
Additionally, on December 31, 2019, we acquired a $74 million credit card portfolio in Puerto Rico. In a separate
transaction, we also acquired the rights to issue credit cards under the JetBlue co-branded loyalty program in
Puerto Rico and we plan to launch this new product in the second half of 2020. These actions evidence the
strength of our capital position, which allows us to return capital to our shareholders while we continue to invest in
our franchise.
Please turn to slide 3. We reported core earnings for the full year, our annual net income of $671 million reflects
an increase of 38% from our 2018 adjusted net income of $487 million. 2019 results benefit from the strong
deposit and loan growth in both Puerto Rico and the US. Credit quality metrics continue to be positive in 2019. In
Puerto Rico, most indicators were better than or close to pre-hurricane levels. In the US, credit quality was solid
throughout the year and reduced our exposure to the taxi medallion market to $19 million.
Our capital levels are strong with year-end Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratio at 17.8%. Our tangible book
value ended 2019 at $55.10, a 17% increase year-over-year. In Puerto Rico, we grew loans by 1.5%, increased
our deposits by 10% and our net interest margin was 4.3%. In our US operation, we grew loans and our deposits
each by 9% and our net interest margin was 3.32%.
Please turn to slide 4, our reported core net income of $167 million, which included an $18 million tax benefit was
slightly higher than the previous quarter and $33 million or 24% higher than the adjusted net income for the fourth
quarter of 2018. Fourth quarter results were driven by lower taxes and higher non-interest income, partially offset
by lower net interest income, higher provision and higher expenses. Net interest income was lower compared to
the previous quarter. The fourth quarter was the first quarter to reflect the cumulative impact of the three recent
interest rate cuts.
As such, the lower yields in our loan and investment portfolios were only partially offset by increases in
investment and money market balances. Credit quality results continue to show favorable trends. The credit
metrics of our BPPR operations reflect a lower non-performing loans, lower NPL inflows and stable net charge-
offs. The increase in net charge-offs in the US operations was related to the taxi medallion portfolio, which has
now been largely resolved.
Please turn to slide 5 for an update on the environment in Puerto Rico. Economic activity stabilized in 2019 after a
post-hurricane rebound in 2018. This occurred despite the macro and political uncertainty that persisted
throughout the year and have continued into early 2020. With respect to migration trends, the most recently
released passenger data from the San Juan airport reflects that the net number of people who left the island
through September was approximately 55,000.
Excluding 2018, which was substantially impacted by the inflow of people coming back to Puerto Rico following
the hurricanes, the data for 2019 reflects a favorable variance compared to the same periods in 2015, 2016 and

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2020
2017, which averaged outflows of 109,000 people. We will need to see whether the recent seismic activity in the
South will have an impact on this trend.
Additionally, the U.S. Census Bureau recently estimated that as of July 2019, the population of Puerto Rico
remained flat versus 2018. This compares favorable to the [ph] 1.7 (07:11) average annual decline in the
population since 2010.
Employment trends remained stable throughout the year. In December, total employment, which includes self-
employed individuals, was down 1.4% versus December 2018. The unemployment rate was 8.4% in December,
which is consistent with levels seen early in 2019. [ph] Salaried (07:41) employment was flat year-over-year with
both private and public employment essentially unchanged compared to the same period last year.
The auto industry continue to perform well in 2019. 106,000 new units were sold, down 1% compared to 2018, but
up 27% and 24% versus 2017 and 2016. Cement sales were down 6% in 2019 when compared to 2018. Though
there was considerable surge in activity in early 2018 following the hurricanes, 2019 sales were 31% and 17%
higher than in 2017 and 2016.
The dollar value of our customers' debit and credit card transactions in the fourth quarter grew by 6% compared to
the third quarter and by 2% versus the same period in 2018. Our consumer loan origination trends in Puerto Rico
have also remained solid, especially in the auto and personal loan segments. Our mortgage originations, while
still at historically low levels, were 7% higher than the previous quarter driven primarily by higher home purchase
activity.
On the commercial loan side, balances increased sequentially. We continue to expect that incremental lending
opportunities will be tied to the performance of the local economy and ongoing recovery efforts. Popular's
customers in Puerto Rico grew by 8,400 this quarter and have increased by 45,000 since December 2018.
As we have commented before, the sustainability and pace of further progress in the Puerto Rico economy will be
heavily dependent on the magnitude and timing of federal recovery funds flowing into the island. The
disbursement of the funds has been slower than many had hoped. This delay is related to concerns regarding the
appropriate oversight of the disbursements of federal funds.
Recently, HUD authorized the use of $8.5 billion of CDBG-DR funds subject to strict oversight requirement in
addition to the $1.5 billion previously released. While this is definitely positive, recent controversy relating to the
distribution of emergency supplies may increase concern over local oversight. It is difficult to predict whether this
ultimately will impact the amount and timing of recovery funds received. However, we continue to believe that
these funds will be significant and have a positive impact on the economy.
I will now offer a brief update on matters related to the seismic events that have impacted the Southwestern part
of the island, including a magnitude 6.4 earthquake on January 7. I want to emphasize that this event does not
compare to the widespread destruction and damage caused by Hurricane Maria. The damage is mainly
concentrated in 16 municipalities, which with the exception of Ponce are relatively small.
Fortunately, none of our employees suffered physical harm and our facilities are in sound condition. Unlike Maria,
telecommunications were unaffected and power was restored within days. We resumed operations on the day
following the earthquake and have provided uninterrupted service since. All but three of our 164 branches in
Puerto Rico are operating normally. We are in constant communication with our employees and working closely
with our customers to help them with their specific needs.

While the impact on our operations is limited, many of the residents in the south suffered significant damages to
their homes, public schools remain closed and the ensuing aftershocks have made it extremely difficult for people
in the region to regain a sense of normalcy. As we have done in the past, we swiftly responded through our
foundation, which has close ties with non-profit organization and communities in the South to bring immediate
assistance to those affected areas.
A little more than two years ago, Puerto Rico faced, and managed through, the impact of Hurricane Maria.
Although the scale of these events is not comparable to Maria, we remain attentive to the impact it could have in
certain sectors of the economy, principally in the hospitality industry. Puerto Ricans are once again demonstrating
overwhelming solidarity and support and are facing this situation with the resolve to move forward. We will
continue working with them, confident that Puerto Rico will once again demonstrate its spirit and ability to rebuild.
I will now turn the call over to Carlos, who will discuss the financial results in greater detail.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio. Good morning. Before we turn to fourth quarter results, let me expand on Popular's full year
2019 performance. Our net interest income increased by 9% year-over-year to $1.9 billion due to solid loan
growth along with robust [ph] though lower (13:35) net interest margin. In 2019, our provision expense decreased
by approximately 37% to $166 million on the back of improved credit trends.
Excluding the FDIC related benefit in 2018, non-interest income increased by approximately 8% year-over-year,
driven by improvement across most segments. Operating expenses increased 4% in the year to $1.48 billion.
Higher personnel costs and professional fees were the primary drivers.
Our capital position was robust and ended the year with tangible book value per share increasing by nearly $9 per
share to $55.10 and Common Equity Tier 1 ratio improved by 88 basis points year-over-year to 17.8%. This
improvement was achieved even after the repurchase of $250 million of common stock and an increase in our
common stock dividend, as Ignacio mentioned, overall an outstanding year.
Please turn to slide 6 for fourth quarter results. As usual, additional information is provided in the appendix to the
slide deck. Today's earnings press release details variances from the third quarter. Net interest income for the
quarter was $467 million, down $10 million from the third quarter. The primary driver of this decline was a
decrease in rates that occurred during the third and fourth quarters of 2019, which along with our asset mix led to
a 17 basis points contraction in NIM.
This impact was somewhat offset by higher commercial loans in both Puerto Rico and in the US, higher auto and
personal loans at BPPR, and lower interest expense. This result is consistent with our commentary last quarter
that lower interest rates negatively impact our results by $4 million to $5 million per quarter for every 25 basis
point drop in rates. Other factors like asset mix and the shape of the yield curve also impact this estimate.
We expect our margin to improve from fourth quarter levels as a result of [ph] present (16:00) expectations of
stable rates, a gradual reduction in our asset sensitivity and the eventual normalization of the levels of Puerto
Rico government deposits. These government deposit levels exceed our expectations that margin improvement
could be less [ph] but (16:17) our net income will benefit. As of the end of the fourth quarter, Puerto Rico public
deposits were roughly $10.5 billion, which is down from the end of Q3, but consistent with the balance as
communicated in our last webcast.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2020
In 2019, our loan portfolio grew by $907 million or 3% despite a runoff of $420 million in our legacy mortgage and
Westernbank portfolios. In 2020, we anticipate slight growth in loan balances for Popular. In Puerto Rico, we
expect to see growth in most segments including commercial, auto and personal loans despite continued runoff in
our legacy mortgage and commercial portfolios. In the US, we anticipate commercial lending to be the primary
driver of higher loan balances.
Our provision in the fourth quarter increased by $10.6 million sequentially. Lidio will expand on this during his
credit commentary. Non-interest income increased by $9.7 million in the period. The improvement was due to a
[ph] $3 million (17:30) increase in insurance fees, driven primarily by higher contingent commissions, which
usually happened in Q4. We benefited from a $3 million improvement in mortgage banking results, maybe due to
MSR valuation adjustment and finally, a $4.7 million variable variance in the adjustment to indemnity reserves on
previously sold loans.
Total operating expenses were $391 million, $14.1 million higher than the prior quarter. Personnel cost increased
by $10.6 million in the quarter. These increases were driven by annual incentives and head count, higher
commissions and incremental investments in employee benefits and training. Professional fees increased by $4.6
million, primarily due to higher expenditures in regulatory, accounting and technology fees, offset in part by lower
legal fees. Business promotion costs were $4.8 million higher in the fourth quarter, reflecting the traditional
seasonality of this expense line.
These increases were partially offset by lower other operating expenses by $9.5 million, mainly due to lower
operating losses and the non-recurrence of a $2.6 million loss related to an undeveloped corporate site, which
was placed for sale during the third quarter. Profit-sharing expenses were $9.4 million in Q4 and totaled $28.8
million for the year. If we exclude the 2019 profit-sharing expense, which by definition is not budgeted, our
average quarterly expense for the year was $362 million, consistent with our original guidance of $364 million.
For 2020, we expect average quarterly expenses to be around $383 million. The increase from 2019 is mostly
driven by higher expenses in the following categories. Personnel, as we continue to invest in training and
compensation with the related benefits also increasing, a tight labor market in Puerto Rico are in the areas where
we operate in the mainland contribute to this increase.
Technology, as we've continued to modernize our digital capabilities, [ph] pure (19:59) obsolescence and address
regulatory, cyber and compliance needs, some of the increased results from the completion of multiyear
technology investments that now start to be amortized.
And finally, business promotion, especially expenses related to rewards programs for our clients, many linked to
our revamped credit card offerings in Puerto Rico and growth in our digital channels. Part of this higher
technology and rewards expenses are related to our expectation of higher levels of activity by our clients.
Obviously, we will strive to come in below this level of expenses if possible. Management objectives for 2020
reflect this goal. Our effective tax rates for the quarter was 8%, which includes a previously disclosed benefit of
$18 million related to revisions of the amounts of exempt income for the year 2015 to 2017. Excluding these
adjustments, our effective tax rate would have been 18%. For 2020, we expect the effective tax rate to be within a
range of 19% to 21%.
Please turn to slide 7. Our capital levels remain strong relative to mainland peers as well with respect to well
capitalized regulatory requirements. As Ignacio mentioned at the start of today's call, our announced 2020 capital

plan includes three actions: First, an increase in Popular's quarterly common dividend by 33% or $0.10 to $0.40
per share. We expect to implement this increase for our next quarterly dividend in Q2.
Secondly, we will be implementing a common stock repurchase program of up to $500 million. While our recent
buyback programs have been executed via ASRs, the detailed implementation plan for this buyback is still under
consideration.
Finally, on Friday, we announced the redemption of the remaining outstanding balance of Popular's 8.25% Series
B preferred stock, as these securities represent high cost liabilities. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 17.8%,
up from 17.5%, and tangible book value increased in the quarter by $1.69 per share to $55.10. The increase was
driven by our quarterly net income, partially offset by lower unrealized gains on investments and the impact of our
common and preferred dividends. Our return on tangible equity was 12.8% in the fourth quarter and 13.4% in
2019. We will continue to pursue our target of maintaining and improving our double-digit return of tangible equity.
Please turn to slide 8. We have continued our evaluation and implementation efforts for CECL. Based on our
analysis, we estimate that the allowance for loan and lease losses would increase by a range of $320 million to
$350 million or 67% to 73% of the existing reserves. This estimated increase, slightly lower than last quarters, is
driven by the Puerto Rico mortgage, credit card and auto loan portfolios.
Based on this estimate, the day one impact of the adoption of CECL would result in a decrease in tangible book
value of approximately $2 per share or 4%. Since Popular's allowance already exceeds 1.25% of loans, the
incremental allowance resulting from CECL will be excluded from total capital.
In accordance with present regulatory guidance, we plan to phase in the day one effects of CECL on regulatory
capital over a three-year period. As such, we estimate the day one impact to result in a reduction of CET and total
capital of approximately 25 basis points. After the adoption of CECL, Popular will continue to be well capitalized.
As part of the adoption of CECL, the corporation has made the election to break the existing pools of purchased
credit impaired or PCI loans, previously accounted for under SOP. Under CECL, these loans will be accounted for
as individual loans, instead of pools of loans. Up to now, PCI loans have been excluded from being reported as
non-performing due to the estimation of cash flows at the pool level.
Upon transition to the individual loan measurement, these loans will no longer be excluded from non-performing
status. This change in accounting treatment would have resulted as of 12/31/2019 in an increase of $283 million
in reported NPLs. This increase is composed of $156 million in loans currently reported over 90 days past due
that are not NPLs and $125 million in loans that are not delinquent in their payment terms, but would be reported
as non-performing due to other credit quality considerations.
Again, these adjustments in reported NPLs would be as of December 31, 2019, and could change by the time we
report our 3/31/2020 results under CECL. Let me stress that this reporting change does not in any way alter or
increase the credit risk containing Popular's loan portfolio. However, the accounting treatment of the loans will
result in higher reported NPL levels. The corporation would pursue renegotiations, resolutions and loan
dispositions that may reduce this post-CECL reported NPLs further. We are still refining our simulations of the
effects of the new CECL models under provision for 2020. So, we are not in a position to provide additional
insights on provision at this time.
With that, I will turn the call over to Lidio.

Lidio V. Soriano
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Carlos, and good morning. The credit quality metrics for the corporation continue to show favorable
trends. In Puerto Rico, our credit metrics reflected lower non-performing loans, lower NPL inflows, and stable net
charge-offs. In the US, we reached agreements with the majority of our taxi medallion borrowers, resulting in an
increase in net charge-off. Excluding this impact, credit quality metrics in the US remain favorable. We continue to
be attentive to the performance of our portfolios and related credit metrics.
In terms of our exposure to earthquake areas, approximately 8% of our mortgage and 11% of our consumer loan
portfolios pertain to areas declared as major disaster. So far, customer inquiries and requests for modifications
have been limited. In terms of our outstanding direct exposure to the Puerto Rico Government municipalities and
other instrumentalities, at year end, the balance was $432 million, a decrease of $26 million when compared to
last year.
Please turn to slide number 9 to review credit metrics at the end of the year. Non-performing assets decreased by
$26 million to $650 million this quarter, driven by a non-performing loans decrease of $30 million, offset in part by
an OREO increase of $4 million. The decline in non-performing loans was mainly driven by improvements in both
Puerto Rico and the US.
In Puerto Rico, NPLs decreased by $22 million with a $19 million reduction in commercial and a $12 million
reduction in mortgage. The decrease in commercial was mostly the result of two commercial loan relationship,
while the decrease in mortgage was mostly due to the continued improvement in the portfolio.
These reductions were offset in part by higher consumer NPLs of $9 million, mostly related to auto loans.
Following the Reliable acquisition, we have experienced an increase in yearly delinquency, NPLs and net charge-
off in our auto loan portfolio, mostly driven by the [ph] seasoning (29:00) of the acquired portfolio and higher
originations in lower FICO segments.
While we are attentive to these trends, we are not overly concerned as some deterioration was expected following
the acquisition of a current portfolio and changes in the origination mix. We remain pleased with the result of the
acquisition. In the US, NPLs decreased by $8 million, mostly due to an NPL construction loan sold during the
quarter. At the end of the year, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held-in-portfolio was 1.9%, compared to 2.1% in
the third quarter of 2019. The increase in OREO was mainly in the Puerto Rico mortgage portfolio.
Please turn to slide number 10 to discuss NPL inflows. The NPL story is positive, so I'll be brief. Compared to the
previous quarter, inflows of NPLs, excluding consumer loans, decreased by $23 million, driven by improvements
in the Puerto Rico commercial portfolio as the prior quarter included the impact of certain troubled debt
restructured commercial real estate loans. The improvement was offset in part by slight increase of $5 million in
the mortgage portfolio. In the US, inflows of NPLs were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to slide number 11, net charge-off amounted to $82 million or annualized 1.21% of average loans held-in-
portfolio compared to $68 million or 97-basis-point in the previous quarter. The increase of $14 million from the
prior quarter was primarily related to net charge-off toward taxi medallion portfolio of $19 million, reflecting
agreements which with the majority of our taxi medallion borrowers.
At the end of the year, net of reserves, the current value of this portfolio was $19 million or approximately 19% of
its unpaid principal balance. Of the remaining exposure, 80% is on the settlement agreements. Excluding the taxi

medallion impact, the corporation net charge-off will have improved by $5 million or 4 basis points. Net charge off
in Puerto Rico were flat quarter-over-quarter.
The corporation's allowance for loan losses decreased by $35 million from the prior quarter to $478 million, driven
by a decrease of $18 million in Puerto Rico, coupled with a decrease of $70 million in the US. In Puerto Rico, the
decrease was mainly related to a decrease in the commercial qualitative reserves offset in part by an increase in
reserves to the auto loan portfolio. In the US, the decrease in the allowance was driven by the previously
mentioned charge-off to the taxi medallion portfolio. The provision for loan losses increased to $47 million from
$37 million in the prior quarter with an increase of $6 million in Puerto Rico, an increase of $4 million in the US.
To summarize, credit quality metrics continue to show favorable trends for the fourth quarter. In Puerto Rico,
results were better or stable on a quarter-to-quarter basis. While in the US, we reached settlement agreements
with our taxi medallion borrowers impacting charge-off. Excluding this, results for the US were strong.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks.

President & Chief Executive Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Lidio and Carlos, for your update. 2019 was an outstanding year for Popular. We achieved record
financial results and accomplished important milestones. The integration of our auto business, the asset
purchases in Puerto Rico and our recently announced Planned Capital Actions reflect that strength. We begin
2020 on a solid footing and excited about our prospects for the year.
Our Puerto Rico franchise is unrivaled. It's consistently grown our retail and commercial customer base and now
serves 1.8 million customers. However, we do not take our leadership position for granted, and we remain
focused on enhancing our customers' experience across all our channels. Our unmatched branch network is
enhanced by our innovative digital solutions. Approximately, 915,000 of our clients are active online and 80% of
these clients use mobile devices to interact with us.
In December, 52% of our deposit transactions in Puerto Rico were processed through Smart ATMs and mobile
devices, a figure that has been growing consistently. The breadth and depth of our retail and commercial product
offerings in Puerto Rico allow us to meet the evolving banking needs of our customers.
Our operation in the mainland United States, while more focused, provides diversification to our footprint. We
have a strong commercial lending unit that is complemented by two specialized national lending businesses,
condo association banking and healthcare. Our investments at EVERTEC and BHD León contribute to earnings
and represent unrecognized value.
We are encouraged by our results and remain focused on enhancing shareholder value. We are now ready to
answer your questions.

Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
First off, just wanted to drill in a little bit more to CECL, and I appreciate, Carlos, your commentary on not being in
a position to provide guidance on future provisioning at this time. But just with the reserve now approaching 3%
and losses conceivably being incorporated already in that reserve, is there really a scenario where that reserve
does not start to come down in some sort of fashion as 2020 approaches or progresses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
I think as we mentioned, and mentioned by Carlos, we are not providing any guidance on it, but I can – two things
that you are expected to affect the levels of allowance. One is, whether the portfolio grows or not, so that's a
factor and then the other is charge-off. We expect to have charge-off, and there might be slight growth in our
portfolio. So, everything else being equal that should lead to a slight growth in the allowance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I'm sorry. Can you say that again? You said that the allowance should grow?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Everything else being equal, growth in the portfolio and charge-offs should lead to additional growth in the
allowance, yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then switching gears to talk about loan growth a little bit, saw some nice commercial loan growth this
quarter. Was any of that tied to a specific post-Hurricane Maria recovery money flowing to the island?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2020
Ignacio Alvarez A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Popular, Inc.
This is Ignacio. It's hard to tie in directly. I mean, some of the construction clients probably have some, but I would
say, it was not directly tied to the recovery efforts. Again, some of the lines for our clients to do work were
increased, and they used some of those lines. But I would not attribute it primarily to that. I would attribute it
primarily just to general economic activity.

Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just a final question for me, as we think about expenses for 2020, the $383 million average, does
that include profit sharing, or is that something that if you have a pretty good year would wind up increasing
expenses again?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
No. It does not include a profit sharing because, obviously, we have to be a whole set of targets to – for the profit
sharing to start coming in. So, it does not include any profit-sharing efforts

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good. Carlos, can you share with us – if I recall in the past, when you've returned the capital to shareholders
through the stock repurchase programs, you seem to been able to kind of do it in the beginning – right after the
approval in an accelerated fashion. With this $500 million that you were approved for this time around, is it going

to be spread out more evenly over a 12-month period, or should we expect more of it to be upfront? How are you
guys thinking about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
It's a good question. We're in the middle of consultations with all our esteemed investment banking coverage
teams. So, we – it's not finally decided yet exactly how we're going to do it, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then, another question, you guys seem to have some good success in engaging your customers in the
digital transformation. You've given us additional statistics. Can you give us an idea, are half of your customers
now in digital or two-thirds or how much more do you have to go? And then what kind of benefit from a cost
standpoint do you possibly see in the horizon, where maybe you need fewer branches or smaller branches, et
cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, If you look at our total number of customers, we cite them as 1.8 million. And so, 915,000 are
active online, which means that they transact at least once a month, so more of them are online. Obviously, we
continue to work on digital. We have found that in Puerto Rico, our customers, although they're active online, also
appreciate the proximity in the branches. We will continue to experiment on our branch size and how we can
incorporate digital into the branches, how we can use our Smart ATMs.
And also, we just opened up a branch in The Mall of San Juan, which is sort of a digitally based branch, where we
don't take – we don't process any deposits for any digital transactions...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
No tellers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Popular, Inc.
...no tellers. So, we'll continue to working on that what the branch looks like. But again, if you've ever been to our
branches, the number of transactions in our branches were still high. The number of digital transactions have
grown exponentially, but the number of regular paper transactions have only decreased slightly. So, there's not a
correlation between the exponential growth and the digital. So, we'll have to wait, but we're looking at this closely,
we're experimenting. If you come to San Juan, you ought to see that branch in The Mall of San Juan, it's really
cool.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
That's one of the – probably one of the interesting differences between our business in Puerto Rico and the
business most of our peers in the mainland. Gerard, as you know, in the mainland, mostly what banks have seen
is a transfer of transactions out of the branch into the digital channel. As Ignacio mentioned, our branch channel
continues to be very, very robust and it's really not going down very much.

But all the growth is happening on the digital channels. So, we are doing more transactions as our clients take
digital, but they do not stop going to the branches when they are digital channel clients and that might be slightly
different than the mainland.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. And interesting enough even when you ask customers one of the most important elements they look at
when they pick a bank, it's still the branch network. Now, one thing you got to keep in mind is that, there's been
tremendous consolidation in Puerto Rico in the last 20 years and the number of branches in Puerto Rico as a
whole has reduced dramatically. And in Puerto Rico, the number of branches for 100,000 people is still well below
the US.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. You guys obviously talked about the success of the Wells Fargo auto portfolio acquisition and the
integration into your organization. You mentioned this quarter, you've purchased a credit card portfolio of $74
million in receivables. Two questions. One is, are there potential for more portfolio like acquisitions that you see in
maybe 2020? And then second, is there any interest in building out the density of your New York or Florida
franchises with actual whole bank acquisitions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Popular, Inc.
I think to the first point, we – I think we like to characterize ourselves opportunistic buyers. So, I don't think there's
a lot of reliable auto transactions left in Puerto Rico. But we keep finding and digging and other institutions are
willing to sell, we are opportunistic buyers, so we'll keep looking.
In terms of the US, probably, I think we're pretty comfortable with our footprint in the New York area [indiscernible]
(43:09) should be looking forward probably to grow in the South Florida. But again, we're opportunistic, but we're
not going to do anything that doesn't make economic sense, just for doing a transaction.

Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Good morning, Glen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glen Manna Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, last Friday's announcement for the redemption of the Series B, was there anything else in your Capital Plan
that had redemption of any other or straight preferred or the trust preferreds out there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
No.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Popular, Inc.
No.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
No. We are – all the components of our Capital Plan are now perfect, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glen Manna Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. Just a follow-up on Alex's question, with an ALL that looks like it's around the 3% range post-CECL
day one and maybe charge-offs going down the 75 basis points and 2% loan growth. I guess, the way the Street
is kind of thinking about it, assuming the portfolio mix doesn't change, it would kind of indicate that the provision –
the Street's provision for next year of around $220 million to $225 million is a reasonable methodology under
those parameters, would you kind of agree with that or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean we've heard – Glen, we've heard a lot of people are approaching this different way. Probably the
most common approach we've heard is the one you just described. So, that sounds reasonable. Unfortunately, on
the CECL, the part that this approach cannot incorporate any way is any change in the input variables to the
models. So, my answer is that, yes it sounds reasonable. But despite the fact that it's reasonable, it could end up
not being accurate, because again it is impossible for anybody to sort of be able to gauge the input variables into
the models of each bank reporting. So, yeah, it sounds like the right ballpark, but doesn't mean it's going to give
you the right answer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glen Manna Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Fair enough. And then just a couple of more on – it looks like BPPR's deposit beta on average fed funds
moving was around 6% last quarter and BPNA was 11%. We probably have a little remaining deposit repricing.
Would you expect the betas to stay in that range in each geography as we kind of get that like some period of
deposit repricing after the rate cuts?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2020
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
I mean our deposit beta – the components of our deposit book are the ones you know well, Glen, we have a
public sector deposit book, which is about 30% of deposits in Puerto Rico that has the beta of close to one we
have. The rest of our book in Puerto Rico that has very low beta and the US book that is about half and half high
beta or low beta. If there is no change in mix, which is always the catch here, then the changes I think might be
similar for this whole change in rates, but it looks like rates are going to be flattish. So, I would expect our deposit
cost to reflect the flattish rates more than anything else.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glen Manna Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And the last one on the – the cost of borrowing looks like it went up by 14 basis points quarter-over-quarter.
I know that it's a three-month LIBOR, which is down a bit, but what are the dynamics there on the borrowing side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. It's a small component, Glen. [indiscernible] (47:01) I can get back to you with an answer to that, because I
don't have it on the top of my head. There isn't a lot of change underlying and we are speculating that it may just
be that some parts of the line that were low cost fell off or matured and/or something like that, so you're left with a
little bit of the more expensive stuff, or we may have extended some pieces of that line. Again, it is a small line
that did not change much in magnitude, but it's a valid question. I'll owe you an answer though.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glen Manna Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. Have a great day guys.
