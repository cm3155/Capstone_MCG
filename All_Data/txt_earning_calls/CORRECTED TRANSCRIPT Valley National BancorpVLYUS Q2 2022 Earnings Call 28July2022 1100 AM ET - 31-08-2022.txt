Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ira Robbins.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Travis, and welcome to those of you on the call. I have a few comments to make this morning and
then we have Tom to provide insight on the exceptional growth results that were achieved on both sides of the
balance sheet this quarter. Mike will then discuss our financial results in more detail.
In the second quarter of 2022, Valley reported net income of $96 million, earnings per share of $0.18, and an
annualized ROA of 0.72%. Exclusive of noncore charges, including the provision expense, mainly associated with
Bank Leumi's non-PCD loans, adjusted net income, EPS and ROA were $166 million, $0.32 and 1.25%,
respectively. These exceptional results reflect significant organic loan and deposit growth and our ability to
manage deposit betas in a generally supportive interest rate environment.
With the Bank Leumi transaction behind us and integration efforts well underway, I want to take a moment to put
Valley's recent transformation into context. Beginning on slide 4 of our deck, we compare this quarter's key
financial metrics against the fourth quarter of 2019. This comparison highlights the tangible progress that has
been made in the last 2.5 years as we have executed on our strategic and tactical initiatives.
From a big picture perspective, we have driven sustainable balance sheet growth, diversified and enhanced our
funding base, established new noninterest revenue channels, and benefited from disciplined and strategic M&A.
We have grown organic loans and deposits by just below 10% on an annualized basis over the last 2.5 years.
While COVID weighed on the 2020 results, these growth rates have accelerated more recently.
We have achieved this growth by providing exceptional service and advice to our existing clients and proactively
identifying growth opportunities in specific markets and business segments. Once these opportunities have been
identified, we've dedicated the appropriate resources from a talent, product and technology perspective to ensure
that we capture the available growth.
As growth has accelerated, we have been careful to preserve the stringent underwriting standards that have
supported our long-standing track record of below-peer credit losses. While we haven't materially altered our
underwriting standards, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans remains well above the day one
reserve that was established upon the adoption of CECL.
Meanwhile, neither our earnings nor our capital have benefited from the reserve release that have recently been
common across the industry. Still, we have preserved our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio at 7.5%
without a [ph] dilutive (00:04:37) capital raise while supporting the strong growth.
Turning to slide 5, you can see that our growth has also been extremely profitable. Quarterly adjusted net income
has increased approximately $75 million between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2022. We
are a much more profitable organization today as a result of strong growth in both spread based and noninterest
income.
Our adjusted ROA during the quarter of 1.25% represents a nearly 25-basis-point increase since the fourth
quarter of 2019. We recognize that our future operating performance would drive the trajectory of our valuation.
That said, we provide this snapshot as proof of our ability to execute in challenging times.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Over the last 2.5 years, our tangible common equity and annualized earnings power have increased
approximately $1.2 billion and $300 million, respectively. On a per share basis, tangible book value and adjusted
earnings per share have increased 15% and 33%. We are proud of this performance and confident that our ability
to execute will drive success in the next phase of our evolution.
Finally, as our preference is not to revisit our stated guidance on a quarterly basis, we have attempted to be as
transparent as possible, given the backdrop of an extremely volatile economic and interest rate environment. With
a full quarter of post Leumi results, we thought it would be most helpful to provide combined guidance for the
remainder of the year.
Using the second quarter's loan balance as a starting point, we now anticipate between 8% and 10% annualized
loan growth for the second half of 2022. We anticipate preserving our loan-to-deposit ratio around 100%, give or
take. Based on these dynamics and the June 30 forward rate curve, we would anticipate generating aggregate
net interest income of around $900 million in the second half of the year.
Finally, we expect to achieve an efficiency ratio of below 50% in the second half of 2022 as well.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom and Mike to discuss the quarter's growth and financial results.

Thank you, Ira. On slide 7, you can see a summary of the quarter's exceptional loan growth. For the quarter, total
loans increased approximately $8.2 billion. Excluding approximately $5.9 billion of loans acquired from Bank
Leumi on April 1, our combined organization generated nearly $2.3 billion net growth during the quarter. For
legacy Valley, approximately 70% of the quarter's commercial originations were from existing customers. Loan
growth was split approximately 60/40 between our northern and southern regions.
Growth was also well diversified across asset classes with residential real estate and consumer contributing a
proportional increase to the quarter's results. We anticipate that residential and consumer activity will slow
meaningfully for the remainder of the year. C&I loans grew nearly 50% during the quarter, or 9%, excluding loans
acquired from Bank Leumi. Meanwhile, CRE loans grew 19% during the quarter, or 4%, excluding loans acquired
from Bank Leumi.
While our pipeline remained strong at approximately $4.9 billion, which includes nearly $1 billion for legacy Bank
Leumi lenders, underwriting standards have begun to tighten as rates have risen. The strong first half results
positioned us to meaningfully exceed the full year 2022 growth guidance that we presented previously.
Finally, on this slide, you can see that origination yields increased approximately 76 basis points during the
quarter. As you would expect, origination yields increased each month as rates moved higher. We anticipate that
origination yields will continue to ascend as the Fed raises rates.
Turning to slide 8, we are pleased that deposit growth is also very strong during the quarter. Total deposits
increased nearly $8.3 billion with approximately $7 billion of that coming from Bank Leumi balances acquired on
April 1. Organic deposit growth trends were strong during the quarter and benefited from activity in our niche
national deposits and cannabis segments.
Traditional commercial checking account growth remained strong and contributed to the increase in noninterest-
bearing deposits during the quarter. We acknowledge that rapidly higher interest rates have created pressure in

certain segment of our deposit business. However, we have strategically built and acquired differentiated funding
verticals for exactly this type of environment.
We are pleased with the deposit story and our ability to manage low betas across the portfolio to this point. We
continue to focus meaningful time and energy to the deposit gathering side of our business to ensure that deposit
betas outperform our prior experience.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn to provide more insight on the quarter's financials.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Tom. Slide 9 illustrates Valley's recent net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income
increased over $101 million from the linked quarter. Approximately $65 million of this increase was from Bank
Leumi sources. The remaining organic increase was the result of strong organic loan growth and the impact of
higher interest rates on our asset-sensitive balance sheet.
Our reported net interest margin increased 27 basis points to 3.43% from the first quarter of 2022. Exclusive of
the linked-quarter impact of PPP loans, the margin expansion was closer to 31 basis points. The linked-quarter
net interest margin increase also reflected a 33-basis-point increase in earning asset yields, driven by the
repricing of our adjustable loans and higher yields on new originations.
Inclusive of the benefit from higher noninterest-bearing deposit balances, Valley's total cost of funds increased a
modest 6 basis points in the quarter. We are very pleased with our ability to manage funding betas so far. As Tom
mentioned though, we are cognizant of competitive pressures around us and acknowledge that funding costs will
remain in focus for the remainder of the year.
Moving to slide 10, we generated over $58 million of noninterest income for the quarter as compared to $39
million in the first quarter. The increase was primarily the result of the Bank Leumi acquisition, which enhanced
wealth management and loan fees and foreign exchange revenue.
From an organic perspective, the anticipated reduction in commercial loan swap revenue was largely offset by an
increase in gains on mortgage loan sales. It is likely that gain-on-sale revenue will decline from current levels, but
we are very excited about the growth opportunities that exist in other noninterest income areas, including those
contributed by Bank Leumi. We are very pleased with the noninterest income growth we have achieved in the last
few years and remain focused on maintaining our momentum.
On slide 11, you can see that our noninterest expenses were approximately $300 million for the quarter or $242
million on an adjusted basis. The linked-quarter increase in adjusted expenses was primarily the result of Bank
Leumi and higher intangible amortization costs associated with the transaction.
Legacy Valley expense growth was relatively muted. The quarter's strong revenue growth helped drive our
efficiency ratio to 50.8% from 53.2% in the first quarter. As Ira mentioned earlier, we anticipate generating an
efficiency ratio around 50% for the second half of the year.
Turning to slide 12, you can see our credit trends for the last five quarters. Our allowance for credit losses as a
percent of total loans increased to 1.13% at June 30 from 1.07% at March 31. This level of reserve coverage
remains well above the 0.89% day one reserve we established upon the adoption of CECL. Neither our earnings
nor capital levels have benefited from recent reserve releases, which differentiates us from many of our peers.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
For the fourth consecutive quarter, we recognized de minimis non-PCD net charge-offs totaling just $2 million.
Approximately $70 million of the $82 million linked-quarter increase in nonaccrual loans were for loans acquired
from Bank Leumi. Reported nonaccrual loans increased to 0.72% from 0.65% of total loans and remained well
within our recent historical range.
On slide 13, you can see that tangible book value declined approximately 2.8% for the quarter. This was mainly
the result of the acquisition of Bank Leumi and the negative OCI impact associated with our available-for-sale
securities portfolio. Relative to peers, this OCI headwind remains manageable as a result of our relatively small
securities portfolio and modest AFS exposure, which reflects our continued focus on tangible book value
preservation.
Tangible common equity to tangible assets declined to 7.5% from 8.0% in the prior quarter, primarily as a result of
our organic loan growth. Our risk-based regulatory ratios declined at a somewhat faster pace as the average risk
[ph] weighting (00:15:35) for our loan portfolio ticked up as a result of the growth composition.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

Not to be nitpicky, but just to clarify, I heard two different things. The efficiency guide, is it below 50% or at 50%
for the back half of the year? And then maybe just a step below that, can you give us any commentary you're
willing to share about kind of the dollar expense run rate from here on a core basis and whether there's maybe
some things that could impact that up or down as we look to the back half of the year.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
So, I'll give the updated guide, it is below 50% as to where we think the efficiency ratio will be for the second half
of the year. And then maybe, [ph] Michael (00:16:57), talk a little bit about sort of what the focus is on the
noninterest expense figure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. Thanks, Ira. From an efficiency perspective, we're fairly confident in our guide given our outlook for revenue
growth. And we'll expect to lag expense growth and drive positive operating leverage through the second half of
2022. And keep in mind that the quarterly expense growth was entirely the result of the addition of Bank Leumi's
operations and higher intangible amortization costs, which were up $7 million over Q1. So, legacy Valley
expenses were effectively flat in the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And is there any kind of movement in some of like a deal closing and whether that – I mean, I'm sure you guys
flagged a lot of it in that $55 million of onetime. But is there anything else that we should be mindful of that could
normalize or maybe elevate it or nothing comes to mind?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, Mike, this is Travis. So there are some additional integration costs associated with Leumi, which are kind of
for the ongoing investments that we needed to make in our ongoing business, things like rewiring their offices and
other things. Those costs in the quarter were relatively minimal, but those will decline over time. And I think if you
think about the trajectory of expenses from here, there is some, I'd say, inflation-based increase that we anticipate
to offset the majority of with further cost saves and efficiencies on the Valley side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And so, no change to the – kind of the cost saving expectations, whether from a dollar amount or a
timing standpoint at this time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
No.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then on the deposit side, appreciate Tom's comments about trying to keep the
beta lower. It sounds like some of the deposit niches are going to be really critical to that. Was curious if you guys
are willing to maybe provide some micro updates on a handful of those. Venture banking I know, I think you guys
had discussed last quarter had some good growth. Obviously, that market had a much more volatile second
quarter. Just curious kind of where some of those deposit niches stand today and which opportunities then could
be the most material near term.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Yeah, Michael, it's Tom. So I'll give you some highlights there. On the tech business, the deposits were up 67%
since we announced the deal and 32% year-to-date. So we are seeing that continued growth there. More
importantly – or no, equally importantly, our relationship-driven strategy of driving our commercial deposits is
working. Those deposits were up over $300 million for the quarter. That combined with our HOA, cannabis and
national deposit business, all which are growing in double-digit percentages are contributing to our ability to fund
our loan growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And has – the kind of cost of those niches, has it been as resilient kind of as you would have expected? Or, I
mean, obviously, there are competitors looking for kind of lower-cost deposit growth. I mean, are you seeing any
change in that or do you still feel like there's some room for market share taking in several of those targeted
niches?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
I mean, I'll answer a portion of them and then Ira will chime in here. On that commercially driven relationship part,
61% of that growth is noninterest bearing. We expect that to continue. Ira, if you want to comment, I'll take the
others.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. And I think, Mike, we made a real concerted effort over the last 4.5 years to really focus on diversifying the
funding book that we have. So as certain segments of the deposit book become more beta sensitive, we have
alternatives to raise deposits from other niche categories. Some of the cannabis business obviously has a very
low cost basis. And even as Tom mentioned on the tech business, it was one thing, we acquired Bank Leumi's
international tech business, but we've organically decided to grow the domestic piece of it as well. So we think we
have enough different alternatives, even from a retail funding perspective that provides us a pretty good segment
and pretty good outlets to continue to raise the deposits that we need to support the active loan growth we have
at a manageable rate from a funding perspective that we think will be much less than where we were last time
around.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And then just last from me and I'll step back. Just on the kind of go-forward provision and credit
environment here, loan growth obviously going to continue with the guide that you guys provided, just at least as it
stands today, what type of kind of reserve are you allocating against incremental loan growth? And is it – is the
unemployment rate still one of the bigger drivers of the CECL model here and the Moody's forecast? Or is there
anything else we should be mindful of as we try to think about how that will trend into what's obviously a pretty
uncertain 6 to 12 months?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, I'll take a crack at this. Valley now stands at 1.13% and the median for banks is now 1.15%. So just like
Ira's comments earlier regarding the change in deposit funding or funding in general, how it's not the [ph] Valley of
old (00:22:11), you can see the allowances also that same way.

The bias, if you will, in provisioning, if all things were to stay equal, which they're probably not going to in the
economy, but if they did, I would say the bias is towards even smaller provisions. And here's why. Most of the loss
history that would have been more negative than the current is dropping off, right? This is the 2020 pandemic-
related loss.
So the loss history is the largest driver of the model. Now, having said that, considering the loan growth that we've
put up, we're going to continue to keep pace based on that loss history with any loan growth that we continue to
book.

Just want to follow up on the deposit side actually. And I'm not sure if I missed this, but in terms of the cannabis
business, where are balances at this point? And I think you talked about maybe double-digit growth. Just
wondering where you think you can ramp that up since I assume it's still pretty early in building out that business.
Where do you think you can ramp that up, call it, by year-end?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, Frank, thanks for the question. We really haven't provided much guidance with regard to specific deposits,
and I think we'll probably keep it that way at this point. I will tell you, the number of accounts have continued to
grow dramatically, we're up 40% in the number of accounts from where we were previously, which is a pretty big
effort when you think about the growing industry that we have here. We now bank 7 of the top 10 multistate
operators, we're in 25 states, and we're continuing to be very excited about the opportunities associated with the
cannabis business.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. Okay. Hey, Matt. It's Tom. The first half, we benefited from the strong residential consumer growth. That
was about 20% of our organic growth. We expect in the second half, those levels to be negligible. It's just not
going to – it's not going to grow, okay?
On the commercial side, our pipeline remained strong. However, we're dealing with a rapidly changing interest
[ph] rate (00:26:24) environment, as well as potential economic slowdown. So, that's likely to reduce our pull-
through in our work-in-process pipeline, okay?
We do believe that we have solid growth opportunities across all our markets, which we've seen in the first half of
the year. So, that should support the loan growth guidance that we provided for the second half. And I just want to
point out, in this growth, we have never compromised our credit standards. We're still a very diverse granular
production shop.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Along those lines, I wanted to maybe get some color on how the underwriting has changed or how you've
adapted to the current environment, which seems like a little bit more tenuous, and are you asking more of your
borrowers in terms of additional equity or recourse or personal guarantees when it comes to originating loans?
Curious there.

Yeah, it's all the above. And keep in mind that 70% of our business is repeat business with longtime, valued,
strong existing customers that have been through these cycles. So, there's a level of capability and credibility that
they have built. That being said, we stress loans at a much higher interest rate, which we began several months
ago. We stress high-risk industries on a regular basis and constantly look at the portfolio.
On the consumer side, we changed our requirements on FICO, on loan-to-value. Our average loan-to-value on
our real estate-related loans is in the 60s for the most part. And we have always taken a much more conservative
approach with regards to cap rates than others. And if you look at the book of business, it reflects that because it
is very diversified by type, by region and all.
Our average production – our average loan on real estate was $4.8 million for this past quarter, and C&I was
about $1 million on average for each loan. So we will – we'll maintain those standards. We're looking at constantly
adjusting FICO scores on the consumer side and loan-to-values on the commercial side.

Got it. Okay. And then turning to the NIM, could you provide what the purchase accounting benefits were that
flowed through the NIM this quarter and the expectations on that over the next year.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Sure. This is Mike. I'll give you the recon, because we anticipated that this question would be asked. So in Q1,
that number was $5 million. That obviously excluded Leumi. In Q2, it was $15 million. But of that $15 million, $2.5
million of that was related to payoffs. And so, the run rate for Q3, we would expect to be about $12.5 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And a year from now, what is that expected to be? Just so I have my kind of cadence of [ph] decline, right
(00:29:15)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
I think it would be about the same.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. I did want to address fee income a little bit. I get the sense that swap fees could be a bit volatile. Curious
overall if this kind of $58.5 million run rate is a good one or do you think you can grow off that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think we – we believe that that is a fairly good go-forward run rate. You got to consider that swap fees are
going to be impacted by the general interest rate environment, and I think that'll probably get tougher as people
look at the individual coverage of their own debt service. But we'll see how that pans out.
Tom's comments earlier regarding resi mortgage is probably going to be challenged as well. But what's exciting
about the change here is the – Bank Leumi brought in some opportunities for us to kind of counterweight or
balance out some of those other items. And so I think we feel right now that a mid-50s to $60 million per quarter is
reasonable.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then last one, when we announced – or when you announced Leumi, it's one of those things where we
build on the cost saves but none on the revenue synergies. Once you're – now that you're fully integrated, could
you just talk a little bit about those revenue synergies, where are you most excited to grow the business?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. It's Matt again – Tom again, Matt, sorry about that. I forgot who I was for a second there. I think just to
remind you, when we entered into the transaction, we retained all of the customer-facing frontline people. That
also includes the credit people, the administrative side, anyone that touch the customer was retained as part of
this. So we have effectively seen a relatively seamless adjustment on the commercial side, and that's evidenced
by the 24% commercial loan growth in the quarter. So that is all operating positively.
We identified a small group of healthcare loans that we wanted to exit, and Leumi had begun that exit strategy
during this transition. Those are the only customers that we have lost in any material way since we started this.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
I think the – the balance sheet and they came into this with a pretty robust pipeline, and the balance sheet that we
now have together gives them the ability to retain customers that previously had to go to other banks because
they were topped out at Leumi and that should continue. The tech piece is an exciting piece for us. We gave you
the numbers on that. That grows. We're staffed there. We have added staff in all of the markets, Chicago, LA and
Florida on the Leumi side. We'll continue to opportunistically add staff there.
The greatest opportunity continues to be not only on the VC tech piece but on the consumer piece. There's been
a regular flow of referrals from the Valley to the Leumi private bank side or from the Leumi side to the Valley
consumer side that has been probably on a similar or larger scale than we had anticipated. And that flow of
business from Leumi in Israel for their international clients, as well as for their participations in our real estate
loans that we originate here, that continues on the pace that we expected.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think, Matt, some of the other stuff that we've looked at is really what Leumi didn't offer to some of their customer
base that really Valley as a full-service commercial bank is able to really do. We have a very strong consumer set
product as well that we're able to offer to many of their customers. So, we've seen a lot of referrals on the
residential side, as well as the retail deposit side as well, just having a branch network, as well as having a strong
international group there as well for us.
So, we think there's boundless opportunities. We've seen significant referrals across the organizations already.
And like you said, while we didn't model in any of the revenue synergies, we're already beginning to see a lot of
them.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Good, good. Hey, quick question. In terms of the loan growth, I may have missed this in the preamble, but from a
legacy basis, just curious how the southern markets, some of the newer markets fared this year and maybe the
outlook for growth into the second half of the year and 2023.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. On the – it's Tom again, David. On the segments or the regions, the production is 60% north, 40% south.
That's been growing in the south. The loan growth in the south is at an accelerated pace to the north. It's growing
at around 25%. If you remember back in 2020, we began bringing in a team of people in all of the major markets
in the south. We brought in 15 lenders, mostly C&I. They produced about 20% of our organic growth in this last
six months, and 90% of what they produced in this past quarter was C&I related. So it's – we're seeing faster
growth in the south, but very solid, stable growth up north with this strong customer base that we have here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
And is it safe to assume that those C&I customers are also bringing in commercial deposits as well with these
relationships?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Absolutely. And that's – we referred to that earlier, that $300 million growth in – quarter-to-quarter and most of
that, 60-plus percent, being noninterest bearing. And you've seen that in both north and south that growth in
deposits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. Got it. Got it. And then maybe just one final question. Now that the acquisition is behind you, share
buyback, does that enter into the playbook as you enter into the second half?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think we've built such a wonderful organic engine here that any incremental capital we have, we think, we can
put back into the business and give the shareholder a much better return.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got it. Appreciate the color.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, Jon. How are you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good. I think the phone lines are down at JPMorgan. That must be it. Feel bad for the guy. You may have just
answered this on Dave Bishop's question, but you talked about 70% of growth from existing clients. Is that the
story with the other 30% that's the southern markets and the new hires or is there something else to call out
there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
No, no, it's – 70% of our business are to people who have done business with us in the past. 30% would be of
customer that is brand new to the bank. That 30% is spread out but it's more – it's larger in the south.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Got it. Question on margin momentum, and I don't need to pin you down on a number, but just longer-term
thinking, and it kind of goes to deposit base comments. How long does it take a hike, a rate hike, to fully cycle
through your earning asset yields?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
I think one of the easier way to handle that, Jon, is approximately 40% of our loan book is tied to prime, LIBOR or
SOFR. So that would be the stuff to reprice the quickest. I don't know if that's a direct answer to your question, but
I think that's kind of where you start. Let me just also point out like the pace with which origination yields rose
throughout the quarter. So origination yields had increased to 4.5% by the time we got to June. They were closer
to 3.10% in February. So, if you think in that four or five months, whatever it is, origination yields went up 140
basis points, in that time, Fed funds have gone up 150 basis points. So that – we're able to pass through the
borrowers relatively quickly. And then, again, with the remaining 40% of the loans tied to prime, LIBOR or SOFR,
that component is very sensitive as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. That is helpful. Just with your deposit base strength, it just feels like there's a lot of momentum coming in
your margin. So that's good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think definitely – Jon, just to follow up on that, right, obviously, there is a lot of strength there, but I think from an
industry perspective, not just Valley, right, there's going to be a lag here, and there's going to be deposit pressure

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
that really begins to hit many banks. And that's going to happen whether it's two more quarters from now or
whether it's sooner. It's definitely going to impact the overall industry, which is why one of the things we've done in
the last few years is really try to diversify the funding base that we have and not just have it from a retail or a
brokerage business but have it in a multitude of different segments. So we think while there's going to be pressure
on the deposit side at some point based on where interest rates have gone, we do believe that there's a multitude
of different funding sources here that's going to be positive on that funding beta.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, I agree with that. And most of your peers didn't have the kind of deposit growth you have. So it's clear, on a
relative basis, I think you look better. But just – yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
And then on – just following up on that, we've seen deposit growth just through July already more than outpace
where we are on June loan growth. So, that trend that we showed for the second quarter has already continued
through the month of July.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And our total funding beta for the second quarter was one-third of what we've modeled. So we still have a long
ways to go to make up just what we're modeling.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And then, just one very big picture. Your credit numbers look good. You clearly have some cautionary comments
filtered throughout your answers on Q&A, but there's a lot of crosscurrents. And are you guys seeing anything that
bothers you at this point from an economic point of view? I know you're trying to be cautious, but just curious if
there's anything you would call out and flag that might be bothering you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
None. And we're not experiencing any underlying areas of credit concern. We're not really seeing the stress or the
weakness in the customer base and remembering, we've got a long history with many of our customers that we
do this business with. But we are cautious. We are underwriting differently, stressing at a much higher cap rate
than we had in the past. And as we talked about before, we do portfolio reviews on a constant basis and really
focus on the high-risk industries in that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
All right. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Nice job.
