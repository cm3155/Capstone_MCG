Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I want to first by apologizing, I'll sound like a broken record
using the word record over and over again, it really was an outstanding year and quarter. I wish management
could take credit but it is really the work of our advisors and associates that delivered these results. Their
dedication and perseverance during the fiscal year was amazing, we've proven once again that focusing on our
time tested client first strategy and providing outstanding service to our advisors and their clients will guide us
through uncertain economic and global conditions in this case and record setting fashion. The record results we
generated would not have been possible without everyone's contribution. So thanks again.
Starting on slide 4 with our quarterly results, the fiscal fourth quarter capped off what was a record fiscal year on a
number of fronts. The firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $2.7 billion and record quarterly net income
of $429 million or earnings per diluted share of $2.02 which reflects the impact of the 3-for-2 stock split in
September. Excluding the $10 million of acquisition related expenses, quarterly adjusted net income was $437
million and adjusted earnings per diluted share equal $2.06. The increase in quarterly net revenues was largely
driven by record investment banking revenues and record assets under management and related administrative
fees, primarily due to higher private client group assets and fee-based accounts.
Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 21.3% and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity
was 24.1%, a very impressive result, especially in the near zero rate environment and given our strong capital
position. Moving to slide 5, we ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.18
trillion, up 27% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially. WE also achieved record PCG assets and fee-
based accounts of $627 billion and record financial assets under management of $192 billion.
We continue to focus on supporting advisors and their clients through leading technology solutions and a client-
focused culture. As a result, we had a fantastic year in terms of advisor retention, as well as record results and
recruiting new advisors to the Raymond James platform through our multiple affiliation options. We ended the
quarter with records of 8,482 financial advisors, net increases of 243 over the prior period and 69 over the
preceding quarter. Representing a new record during the fiscal year, we recruited financial advisors with
approximately $330 million of trailing 12-month production and approximately $54 billion of client assets to our
domestic independent contractor and employee channels. Also in the private client group, advisors generated
domestic net new assets of approximately $83 billion in fiscal 2021, representing 10% of domestic PCG assets at
the beginning of the fiscal year, a very strong result, reflecting our excellent retention and record recruiting.
Additionally, this year, new account openings and advisor productivity were very strong, contributing to the
excellent net new asset results. Also worth noting on the slide is the impressive loan growth at Raymond James
Bank during the quarter, up 5% sequentially to a record $25 billion. This growth was driven by securities-based

loans to the private client group clients, as well as a strong corporate loan growth. Moving to segment results on
slide 6, the private client group generated record quarterly net revenues of $1.8 billion and pre-tax income of $222
million, a 12.3% pre-tax margin reflecting significant operating leverage over the past year.
The Capital Markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of $554 million and pre-tax income of $183
million, representing an extremely impressive 33% pre-tax margin to net revenues. These record results were
driven by record investment banking revenues, strong tax credit fund revenues and solid fixed income brokerage
revenues. The Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $238 million and record pre-tax
income of $114 million, up 29% and 46% over the year ago period, respectively.
These results were primarily due to growth in financial assets under management driven by net inflows through
fee-based accounts in the private client group, partially offset by market depreciation and net outflows for the
Carillon Tower Advisers during the quarter. Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $176
million and pre-tax income of $81 million, quarterly net revenues increased 9% over the year ago quarter as
higher levels of earning assets offset year-over-year compression in the bank's net interest margin. Sequentially
net revenues grew 4% due to higher asset balances during the quarter.
The pre-tax income growth year-over-year was due to the aforementioned revenue growth and lower bank loan
provision for credit losses in the current quarter, compared to the preceding quarter, the banks pre-tax income
decline largely due to reserve release in the preceding quarter compared to a loan loss provision primarily
associated with the strong loan growth during the fiscal fourth quarter.
Looking at the fiscal year 2021 results on slide 7, we generated record net revenues of $9.76 billion, up 22% over
fiscal year 2020 and record net income of $1.4 billion, up 72% over fiscal 2020. Excluding losses on the
extinguishment of debt and acquisition related expenses during the year, adjusted net income was $1.49 billion,
up 74% over adjusted net income in fiscal 2020. Moving to the fiscal year results on slide 8, the Private Client
Group, Capital Markets and Asset Management segments generated record net revenues and record pre-tax
income and all of our segments realized substantial operating leverage during the fiscal year. Once again these
results reinforced the value of our diverse and complementary businesses.
And now for a more detailed review of the fourth quarter financial results, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul
Shoukry. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. I'll begin with consolidated revenues on slide 10. Record quarterly net revenues of $2.7 billion,
grew 30% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, record asset management fees grew 8% sequentially,
commensurate with the sequential increase in the beginning of the quarter balance of fee-based assets. Private
Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up 2% during the fiscal fourth quarter, providing a modest
tailwind for this line item for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Consolidated brokerage revenues of $541 million, grew 9% over the prior year, but declined 2% from the
preceding quarter. Institutional fixed income brokerage revenues remain solid, albeit down from the strong levels
of the comparison periods. Brokerage revenues in PCG were up 17% on a year-over-year basis, but flat
sequentially due to lower trading volumes, which offset the benefit from higher asset balances and associated
trailing commissions.

For the fiscal year, brokerage revenues were up 13% to a record $2.2 billion, reflecting records for both PCG and
fixed income, which had a fantastic year. That was a testament to their leading position in the depository
segment.
Account and service fees of $170 million, increased 21% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, largely due to a
higher average mutual fund assets, driving higher associated service fees. Paul already discussed our record
investment banking results this quarter. So let me touch on other revenues, other revenues of $74 million or up
35% sequentially, primarily due to higher tax credit funds revenues. We also had $18 million of private equity
valuation gains during the quarter, of which approximately $5 million were attributable to non-controlling interest
reflected in other expenses.
Moving to slide 11, clients' domestic cash sweep balances, which are the primary source of funding for our
interest earning assets and the balances with third-party banks that generate our RJBDP fees, ended the quarter
at a record $66.7 billion, up 6% over the preceding quarter and representing 6.3% of domestic PCG client assets.
As we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks during fiscal 2021,
$10.8 billion of client cash is being held and the client interest program at the broker dealer. Over time, that cash
could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, which would hopefully earn
a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries.
On slide 12, it was great to see an 8% sequential increase in the combined net interest income and BDP fees
from third-party banks to $198 million. This growth was largely attributable to strong asset growth in a resilient net
interest margin at Raymond James Bank, which remained right at 1.92% for the quarter. We expect the bank's
NIM to settle right around 1.9% over the next couple of quarters. The average yield on RJBDP balances with
third-party banks remain flat, a 29 basis points in the quarter. If banks demand for deposits doesn't improve from
current levels, we believe there will be downward pressure on this yield in fiscal 2022, especially in the back half
of the fiscal year, which is why we have been so focused on generating on balance sheet growth in assets that
could deliver good risk adjusted returns.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 13. First, our largest expense compensation. The compensation ratio
decreased sequentially from 67.2% to 65.8% largely due to record revenues in the Capital Markets segment,
which had a very low 52% compensation ratio during the quarter. Given our current revenue mix and disciplined
management of expenses, we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of 70% or lower in this near
zero short-term interest rate environment. And as we experienced in fiscal 2021, we can do meaningfully better
than 70% with capital markets revenues at or near these record levels, which is our expectation for at least the
next quarter or two.
Non-compensation expenses of $361 million decreased 15% sequentially, primarily driven by the $98 million loss
on extinguishment of debt in the fiscal third quarter. Somewhat offsetting this favorable variance, we had a
modest provision for credit losses during the quarter, compared with a bank loan loss reserve release in the fiscal
third quarter.
Overall, our results in fiscal 2021 show we have remained focus on managing controllable expenses while still
investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients. While we are still finalizing our
fiscal 2022 budget, we do expect expenses to increase meaningfully in fiscal 2022 for a variety of reasons. First
and foremost, we are going to continue investing in people and technology to support the phenomenal growth of
our business over the past year, ensuring we maintain very high service levels and leading technology solutions
for advisors and their clients.

We also expect business development expenses to pick up as travel, recognition trips and conferences have
already started resuming in the fiscal first quarter, which our advisors and associates are really excited about.
Just as a reminder, business development expenses totaled about $200 million in fiscal 2019 before the start of
the pandemic.
Additionally, whereas we had a $32 million net benefit for credit losses in fiscal 2021, we would expect bank loan
loss provisions for credit losses associated with net loan growth in fiscal 2022. Slide 14 shows the pre-tax margin
trend over the past five quarters. Pre-tax margin was 20.8% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, and adjusted pre-
tax margin was 21.2% which was boosted by a record revenues and still relatively subdued business
development expenses.
At our Analyst and Investor Day in June, we outlined a pre-tax margin target of 15% to 16% in this near zero
interest rate environment. And right now, we believe the top-end of that range is an appropriate target given the
aforementioned expense growth we currently expect in fiscal 2022. But as we experienced during the fiscal year,
there's meaningful upside to our margins when Capital Markets revenues are strong as they have been in fiscal
2021.
On slide 15, at the end of the quarter, total assets were approximately $61.9 billion, an 8% sequential increase,
reflecting solid growth of loans at Raymond James Bank, as well as a substantial increase in client cash balances
being held on the balance sheet. Liquidity and capital remained very strong. The total capital ratio of 26.2% and a
Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.6% are both over doubled the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized, given the
significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and grow the business.
You can see that RJF corporate cash of the parent ended the quarter at $1.15 billion, decreasing 26% during the
quarter as we have restricted the cash that we plan on using to close on the Charles Stanley acquisition, which
we currently expect to close in the first or second quarter of fiscal 2022, where as soon as we receive the
requisite regulatory approvals.
Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. During the fiscal year, we
repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares, split adjusted for $118 million. As of October 27th, $632 million remains
under the current share repurchase authorization. Due to the restrictions following our announced acquisition of
TriState Capital Holdings, we do not expect to repurchase common shares until after closing.
Lastly on slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. The credit quality of the bank's loan
portfolio remains healthy, with most trends continuing to improve. Criticized loans declined and non-performing
assets remain low at just 20 basis points. The bank loan loss provision of $5 million was primarily driven by strong
loan growth during the quarter.
The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of the loans held for investment declined from 1.34% in
the preceding quarter to 1.27% at quarter end. For the corporate portfolios, these allowances are higher at around
2.25%.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?

Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. Overall, I'm very pleased with our fantastic results for this quarter and the fiscal year, which
exceeded many records. As for our outlook, we are well-positioned entering fiscal 2022 with strong capital ratios,

quarter end records for all of our key business metrics and strong activity levels for financial advisor recruiting and
investment banking. In the Private Client Group segment, results will benefit modestly by starting the fiscal first
quarter, with a 2% sequential increase of assets and fee-based accounts.
Additionally, based on our robust recruiting pipeline, we hope to continue our current recruiting trend as
prospective advisors are attracted to our client focus values and leading technology platforms. In the Capital
Markets segment, the investment banking pipeline remains very strong, and we expect a solid fixed income
brokerage results driven by demand from the depository client segment and the Asset Management segment with
equity markets remain resilient, we expect results will be positively impacted by higher financial assets under
management. And Raymond James Bank should continue to grow as we have ample funding and capital to grow
the balance sheet.
We will continue to focus on lending to PCG clients through our securities-based loans and mortgages, and we
will continue to be selective and deliberate in growing our corporate loan and agency-backed securities portfolio.
As we look ahead, we remain focused on the long-term and our long-term growth. And as we've outlined at our
recent Analyst and Investor Day, those key growth initiatives include driving organic growth across our core
businesses, continuing to expand our investments in technology and sharpening our focus on strategic M&A. Our
recent announcements to acquire a TriState Capital and Charles Stanley Group demonstrate our focus on these
initiatives and our commitment to deploy excess capital over time. We believe these acquisitions stay true to our
longstanding criteria, which is a good cultural fit, a strategic purpose and makes sense for our shareholders.
Finally, thank you again to our advisors and associates for providing excellent service to their clients during these
uncertain times. These results are a testament to the dedication of everyone in the Raymond James family.
With that, I'm going to turn it back over to the operator for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP
Securities. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Good morning, Paul and Paul, how are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good, Devin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Good. So Paul, a lot of records, as you mentioned, so clearly momentum really across the business heading into
2022. I appreciate that the Capital Markets segment can drive some variability in margins and so that's tough to
predict. And so that kind of all gets wrapped up in the firm-wide kind of margin commentary. But if we set that
aside and we think about the business, I mean you're sitting in a much better place heading into 2022 than you
were in 2021. And I appreciate that you're also going to be ramping investment into the business as well, which
makes sense.
So as we think about the individual segments whether it's PCG or asset management or the bank, can you talk
about where operating leverage may exist and then where it's more challenges because of the investments? I
think that would be helpful to unpack way from some of the – maybe the difficulty in predicting capital markets
because it does feel like there should still be some operating leverage on some of those areas. But [ph] wonder
(00:25:10) just dig into this a little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, the business that's probably – it's our best business, but probably most margin challenged the Private
Client Group because it has the high comp ratio with our independent contractors. And if you're – to deliver 20%
margins in the business when you have a 70% comp ratio or less in these times, right, shows the balance we
have on really managing expenses and making sure we invest. So we had a good margin this year based on the
growth. But the real delta in our margins come from the capital markets and the banks as they grow and asset
management, they have much higher margins.
And to the extent they grow, they drive our comp ratio down and our margins up. So those are the ones that have
the delta. Now the good news is the backlog in capital markets is fantastic, it's at historic basis. And the problem
with that business, as you know, can stop on a dime and it can increase. But our visibility is really good into this
first quarter, which is very strong and the second quarter should be very good, too. After that, you never really
know because of the M&A and underwriting part depends on the environment. The bank, we expect good growth,
you saw very good growth this quarter, and given the markets right now, and I think a reasonable economy going
forward, the best we all can tell, we should have growth there.

Raymond James Financial, Inc.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
And the asset management business continues to grow, especially with our record recruiting and we're still on
that same pace. If you look at commits and people coming through the office, we are still on a very, very – we're
still at that record pace. If you took a snapshot today, so shorter term, we see these kind of very good margins.
But if capital markets slowdown or the economy turns and M&A deals stop and stuff, that's where we're going to
get the margin compression again without interest rates. It wasn't that long ago that half of our pre-tax income
was interest spreads. So we've [ph] last said that (00:27:18) overnight when March over two Fed meetings. And
so it's kind of amazing getting these kind of margins without that help.
So that's the other factor and so we can't predict if that comes back, even if the markets cool down, that's certainly
going to continue to expand margins. So I wish I could tell you, I can tell you where we sit today. It looks good
from the next quarter, but between the economy and Congress and regulators and interest rates, it all could
change because those aren't in our control.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Yeah. I really appreciate that, Paul and helpful context across the businesses here. Just a quick follow up on the
fixed income brokerage business and maybe the outlook here talking about how well the firm has done here. I
mean, revenues were up 80% from 2019. Can you just help us a little bit around the both maybe the near-term
outlook for that business?
And then how to think about [ph] intermediate (00:28:18) term because it had such a step function in growth and
contribution? Is the size of the platform or personnel of that much greater or has it just been an environment – I
know the environment has been incredibly favorable, but how you guys are thinking about that business and how
maybe [ph] car (00:28:36) were above average for the business or whether it's just been kind of some underlying
growth there that maybe we haven't foreseen in the platform?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
That's a little of both. There's some new product focus and products they've brought to the market to their clients.
The biggest factor has really been if you look at the sweet spot in the business, that's the depository franchise and
the depository franchise, like all banks and us have a ton of cash. And in order to put that cash to work, they can
make loans. And if they can't make loans fast enough, they buy securities. And that's where they really utilize us
as – actually, for us – a lot of banks, almost as a treasury manager, we help them look at where they should
invest in the spreads and yields. We provide a lot of tools for them and that business has been very, very good
because of the cash in the system.
So as long as that cash in the system stays there, those brokerage revenues should be very, very good. And
again, the fixed income business by far had its best record as did the equity capital markets business. So
combine the Capital Markets segment was extremely good and again, short-term to mid-term everything we see
today, we don't see that really slowing down off its pace. It's been a little slower in the last quarter than it had
been earlier in the year, but I'd still call the numbers robust.

Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with
your question.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Just to follow-up on the pre-tax margin questions, maybe a two-part question on the comp ratio. I know
you've guided to a ratio of less than 70%, but at 66% you're coming in well below, and I sort of wanted to assess
how much of this is the benefit of scale and other platform rather than the strength in the capital markets. So first
on the PCG side, a lot of the comp ratio decline has to do with the actions that you've taken to hold administrative
costs down, even as the FA head count and revenues have grown. So how should we think about the
administrative and incentive comp in that segment going forward given the recruiting momentum that you're
seeing right now? And then second, on the investment banking side, if capital markets normalized to pre-
pandemic levels, how should we think about the comp ratio there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So first thing, I think you've got to take the capital markets. You asked if it was scale for the market.
Certainly, it's been a very constructive market. So everyone's done well in capital markets. But we've really
increased our scale to – in our equities business. If you look at the addition of Financo and Cebile during this
quarter, which again, they only have a full year run rate in those numbers. Cebile being the most recent to join the
platform and the hiring we've done across the platform. The leadership there has done a really good job of
building scale, but we were probably under scaled given our size competitors.
So there is a scale play there. But the markets are very, very constructive. So it's a little bit of both in that
business. And in the private client group, a lot of business development expenses were low. We didn't have
conferences, we didn't have award trips, we didn't have the regional meetings because of the pandemic. And now
those are opening up. We have our first major conference will be in November and we've had smaller
conferences and our first award trip, although they're smaller than traditional, they're still there and there's some
make up award trips where we canceled them and moved them into this year.
And, so we'll have some double trips and fact in our employee group, we'll have a double conference because
we're going to – we moved this years to the fall and next years will come in the summer, so certainly those
expenses are back up.

So that's just business as normal and those are highly valued by advisors. They're a great cultural tool to reinforce
the value of Raymond James for a great training. These aren't just fun trips to people, they're fun because we get
together, but it's work. I mean, there are classes, trainings, teaching, so they're very important to the long-term
business both teaching practice management and sharing best practices, as well as explaining new regulations or
new technology tools they need to learn.
So they're very, very valuable. So it's work. I mean fun work, but it's work. So they're essential and those will
return because they're important to the business model.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Maybe the only thing I would add to that is – that comp ratio does fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to a
lot of variables. So I kind of prefer to look at it on annual basis. It was 67.4% for the fiscal year, which was still
much better than our 70% target, largely due to the capital markets results. Their comp ratio this year was 56%, it
was 60% last year and last year was a pretty good year. Once you put it all together, just to show you the
sensitivity there.
And in the private client group, you mentioned some of the initiatives frankly with the non-FA comp up 5% year-
over-year, against the 19% revenue growth rate, while we always strive to achieve operating leverage, frankly,
that gap is not sustainable. We want to make sure that we're providing adequate support levels for our advisors
and their clients. And so, we need to make sure we have sufficient capacity and bandwidth in our service and
product areas to continue delivering excellent service to our advisors and their clients. So when you kind of put all
those things together, that's why we're sort of reaffirming the 70% target, but with that being said, we can continue
to do better than that if capital markets results are as strong as they have been and we expect them to be at least
over the next quarter or two.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And I think one thing I haven't heard in the industry calls, but we certainly hear and all the industry trades is
there's pressure on comp. I mean pay is going up, we can tell by the offers that come in to our people whom we're
glad, people value our folks and but 80% or 90% comp increases, it's taking longer to fill jobs right now in this
market, and everyone's growing. So that's not just us, industry wide, there's comp pressure and I think that's
going to impact the comp ratio coming this year. I can't tell you what it'll be, but we need people who run the
business and support our advisors so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. I appreciate all the color. And then maybe on the TriState acquisition, can you talk about how much
operating leverage is embedded in their model? So, they've had a pretty steady comp ratio in their bank for the
last three to four years, but with 94% of their assets skewed to short-end rates, it feels like there should be room
to drop some of that to the bottom line when rates rise. So I was wondering if you can comment on that and
whether that's baked into your accretion estimates that you announced last week?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, they have – they're technology enabled modeled, and so their technology does give them the ability to –
particularly in the private banking side, to really scale up that business. But as you point out, I think where the
11

operating leverage is really going to come from is rising short-term rates. And we talked about a relatively
conservative net interest margin type estimates that we baked into our projections that would go up to 2% from
where they are now with a 100 basis point increase in rates, and they were actually doing much better than that
before the pandemic, so we try to be conservative there.
And that doesn't even give them the benefit of where we expect most of the synergy to come from, which is really
replacement of their higher cost deposits, a portion of their higher cost deposits with our lower cost deposits that
are sitting on our balance sheet now earning very little and short-term treasuries at the broker dealer per the
regulations. So between short-term rate increases, deposit replacements and the scalability of their technology
enabled model, we think there is significant upside to their results over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And we've got a lot of questions, just why don't you replace all their deposits with our lower cost deposits and it's
that they support deposits from their client relationships, their asset and liabilities, that's how you build
relationships and they're going to run an independent business that way. And they have their own clients, they're
going to manage their clients. And so, part of that is taking their cash reasonable rates to their clients for the loans
they book too. So we put it – I think we said $3 billion of replacement, but that leaves the rest of their deposits in
place. And as they grow, we expect to use more and more of our deposits at a lower cost, but certainly they'll tell
us when they need them and we're not going to interfere with their long-term client relationships.

Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Research Partners
Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe just on getting back to the non-comp side, I get the fact that business
development there should be a lot higher as we reopen and recruiting picks up, but you mentioned kind of 2019
levels. Other firms have kind of talked about some percentage lower, there's some permanent changes in terms
of business practices. Do you expect to really get back to $200 million in 2019 or is there some 70% to 80% of
those kind of levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I think $200 million was sort of just a benchmark. I think it would be a stretch to assume that we would get
there that quickly. We are a bigger business now and have more people now than we had in 2019 and more
advisors. But to your point, I think just in terms of ramping back up to what business as usual looks like, what we
have started the conferences and recognition trips in the first quarter, business travel certainly not what it was
pre-pandemic yet. So I think it will ramp up over time.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
Right. Okay. And then maybe just on the balance sheet, your client cash balance is up $4 billion quarter-over-
quarter, that was pretty big step up. Any thoughts on – of what drove that increase, do you expect it to continue
into Q4? And does that – given that balance sheet growth, doe it kind of change the way you think about your
leverage ratio with the two deals coming up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think that what drives client cash is first, recruiting certainly as we bring more advisors in, their clients have a
portion in cash and we also see, you'd – say, in upmarkets, you don't expect to see as higher percentage in cash,
but people are using it often in lower fixed income. They are just saying, they are worried about rates going up.
They view – many clients view the market as frothy and now as it's continued to grow and they're using their cash
balances to hedge that a little bit.
So even in an upmarket, you've got a pretty good percentage of cash. And again, as assets grow and our
recruiting grow, recruiting is driving it and I think some investors are taking a little off the table and keeping some
in cash as just the balancing or a diversification hedge.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Research Partners
And on the leverage question, any – does it change the way you think about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean I think bringing the cash on the balance sheet certainly does impact our Tier 1 leverage ratio. And in
stress periods, we do have sort of different type of metrics that we think about to absorb a surge in cash balances,
but a question we get a lot from investors and analysts is how do we think about that 10% ratio and potentially
lowering that ratio over time, that target that we – which has doubled the regulatory requirements.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Research Partners
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And our response to that is as long as regulators continue to consider that as a part of your metric and your
requirements, then we need to, in our business, have some cushion for a surge of cash balances because while
cash balances are high now on an absolute basis, they are only 6.3% of client assets, which historically speaking
is a good 100 basis points lower than average.
We can argue whether or not that's because asset values are higher than they were historically speaking, but it is
not unfathomable to see a situation where cash balances surged by another 10% to 20%. And as we saw on
March 2020, regulators don't give a firms relief for accommodating those client cash balances. So we still need to
make sure we have ample flexibility because those type of environment, so when we could be most opportunistic.
So we don't want to be constrained by the Tier 1 leverage ratio. And unless regulators change the treatment of
that accommodated client cash balance, which they didn't do in 2020, and I'm hopeful they will do but not
optimistic. Then we need that cushion.

I also think there could be an opportunity as the Fed cuts back on purchasing securities that those become more
attractive. The rates would become and the spreads more attractive. So actually a shortage of those securities in
the market believe it or not because of the Fed, but once they get out, they are hopeful there's a more of an
opportunity to use those securities on the balance sheet and move cash over to the bank.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi, good morning, Paul and Paul. I just wanted to ask a follow up on a discussion relating to non-comps. So you're
messaging on expenses came through loud and clear. Comp guidance quite explicit, maybe the non-comp
guidance a little bit more vague or leaving more to interpretation, recognizing you're still going through the
budgeting process. I was hoping you could help us handicap the level of non-comp growth ex-provision versus
that exit rate of $1.4 billion. I know, Paul, you'd already spoken about business development expense normalizing
some, but what level of expense inflation should we be underwriting for some of those other categories? And if
you could provide some more context there that'd be really helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, again, there's a lot of growth in there that is driven by business volume. So investment sub-
advisory fees for example, they were up almost 30% with fee-based assets this year. And so – and that's true with
the FDIC insurance expense at the bank, that's going to grow with the banks growth, and so there's a lot of
growth driven variables there. But even when you look at technology, that's something we're going to continue to
invest heavily in to – again continue providing a competitive platform for our advisors and their clients and to drive
efficiency over time and scalability over time.
That was up 9% this year. I could see it being up 10%-plus next year just with our technology initiatives that we
have on the docket. So I don't want to go line-by-line, but I think when you look at the various line items, you can
see that – there's sort of room for a growth. I mean, just again, stepping back, the non-comp expenses grew 5%
in PCG this year versus a 19% growth rate.
So I would say in hindsight, if we had known revenues, we're going to grow 19%, we probably would have grown
those non-comp expenses higher than the 5%. Now some of that was held by the business development with
everything shutdown. But that's not a sustainable relationship over time. We want to make sure that we continue
supporting the business and the infrastructure, the support levels of the business over time.

Got it. Okay. And just for my follow-up on organic growth. Paul, you disclosed pretty impressive stat about 10%
organic growth, implied some acceleration into fiscal year end, just given the strong advisor backlogs across your
affiliation options and the additional scale that you've added on the RIA side. Just curious if you can provide some
context around what you believe is a sustainable organic growth rates as flows begin to settle out around some
sort of new normal?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. [indiscernible] (00:46:05) had such a hard, you asked me to predict the future both as recruiting, will it
continue at this level. We can tell you our visibility is – it is and it's – I think I remember, I forget how many
quarters ago, we talked about a slowdown for one in quarter, but it'd pick up and certainly it did again. And so
we've been on this kind of ramp up for a couple of years. We still see very strong demand, whether it'll be a
record this coming year or just very strong, I don't know. But what we can see today is that ramp up should be
very good. And part of that, net new asset growth is the markets when people bring accounts over or bring in new
clients and the markets up, well the assets are up. So it helps drive that number too. So it's very complex.
I think all we can tell you right now is it's all the factors are in place to show it should be very strong again this
year. But to give you a number, I'd have to know what the market appreciation is, what recruiting is, what – just so
many factors that aren't predictable. I can just tell you that the things that drove at last year look still in place.
Coming into this next quarter and how long it continues, I don't know. We all know that this kind of growth in the
market isn't forever. There's going to be cycles, there could be shocks to the system. But I think we're well
positioned on both sides both to continue our growth. And if there is a shock to the system, our capital and
liquidity will put us in good stead so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. Thanks for that context, Paul. If I could just squeeze in one more ticky tack modeling question. I was hoping
you can provide some guidance on the tax rate for next year and the trajectory for the third-party cash [ph] from
EPOs (00:47:51). Just recognizing that, as you noted, the banks are flush with liquidity, don't have quite as much
demand for client cash.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean the effective tax rate for this fiscal year ended right around just below 22%, which was really
benefited by the non-taxable gains in the corporate-owned life insurance portfolio. So we would still guide, all else
being equal, to around 24% over the year. Now, with that being said, where our stock price is now, we would
expect it to be lower than that in the fiscal first quarter with the timing of our stock-based compensation that vest –
there would be a tax benefit there in the first quarter based on the current price.
But we think 24% over the year plus or minus the impact from corporate-owned life insurance and just as a
reminder, the corporate-owned life insurance creates non-taxable gains when the equity markets are up and does
the opposite when equity markets are down. And that's sort of the impact to the tax rate in that type of
environment. And what was the second part of your question?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
Sorry, just a context around third-party cash [ph] from EPOs (00:49:05), whether you're seeing any return of bank
demand, especially in light of Fed tapering and maybe faster – are these rate hikes happening sooner than
anticipated?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would say that we are not seeing an improvement in third-party bank demand. And so we would – I would
say, see more pressure on the capacity than the rate because I think we're going to try to manage the rate based
on shifting the lack of capacity at this type of rate to either our balance sheet and investing in other assets
essentially.
And that gets helped with an acquisition like we had – the TriState acquisition, for example, bringing more
balances on the balance sheet. The bank growth is anticipated to be strong, our bank, Raymond James Bank
growth is anticipated to be strong this year as well. And we can also accelerate purchases of agency mortgage-
backed securities, if that demand from third-party banks doesn't pick up. And I'd always really expected with the
contract maturities in the second half of the fiscal year, so as we get closer to that, I think we'll be able to provide
you more clarity on what the demand looks – the demand profile looks like at that time.

proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Bailey Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Good morning. This is actually Ryan Bailey on behalf of Alex. The first question I had was really just a clarification
on some of the comments on comp pressure. Is that specifically related to non-advisor comp expense? It
sounded like that was within PCG. Or was that related to additional pressure on TA packages or the payout grid?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
No, I think the TA pressure is again we talked last year that we adjusted TA to be more in-market. And I think it
shows in our recruiting we're doing very well. So I don't see any additional TA pressure. But the pressure that
we're really seeing is on the admin support across whether it's operations, tech, risk, branch professionals, there's
just – there's – comp is under pressure for the whole industry. I know that from roundtables, every firm talks about
it, that they're having longer to recruit. Recruiters are being recruited away, so they're having a harder time hiring.
We see packages come in, so we know there is just – we see comp pressure.
And until I think the market more normalizes and there's more of a return across the sector that could continue for
the year. So it's a general comment. We're not – I was just saying there's a bias that line could be more impacted
than something, but we'll see throughout this year.

Got it. Okay. And maybe then just another quick question on the bank. I think, Paul, you've just mentioned that
you're expecting still strong growth in Raymond James Bank. Is there any sort of impacts more tactically just
given the acquisitions or sort of business as usual and growing the bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
No, we have plenty of funding and capital for them to continue growing at their strong growth rates so long as they
can find assets that generate good risk adjusted returns, which is their mandate to be deliberate and patient, but
also opportunistic. So there's no shift in sort of their growth trajectory or anticipated growth trajectory due to the
acquisition.
