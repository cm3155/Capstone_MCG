Q2 2023 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2023
John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Thank you, Will. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. When we had our last earnings call in April, the
banking industry was still in the fog of war. Three months later, the fog is starting to clear. Liquidity is stabilizing.
The new regulatory framework is coming into focus. And SouthState is in a position of relative strength for the
next phase of the cycle.
We're pleased to report that for the first half of 2023, PPNR per share grew by 34% compared to the first half of
last year. And so far this year, loan and deposit growth has been slightly better than our guidance. You'll recall
that for 2023, we plan to keep deposits flat and for loans to grow at a mid-single digit pace. We projected the loan
growth would be faster in the first half of the year and a little slower in the back half of the year. We're now at the
halfway point for 2023 and deposits are up 2% and loans have grown at a 9% annualized pace. So, balance
sheet growth is on track.
Our geographic business model has proven to be a competitive advantage for deposit pricing. Our regional
presidents have done a superb job of efficiently using exception authority to protect our core relationships while
effectively managing deposit costs. And it helps that SouthState has the lowest average deposit size of our peer
group at $25,000 per account. And that granularity translates to stability. The long-term value of a bank is on the
right side of the balance sheet and our granular and relationship-based deposit funding has resulted in a
cumulative deposit beta of just 22% this cycle. And we're pleased to have had 6% growth in customer deposits in
the second quarter.
Credit metrics are starting to normalize, but charge-offs remain very low. In the last year, we conservatively set
aside $142 million in loan loss reserves to cover only $4 million in charge-offs. The result is that we've bolstered
our reserve, including unfunded loans, by 30 basis points from 1.26% a year ago to a current allowance for credit
losses over 1.5% at 1.56%. We believe the strength of our reserves and our capital base will give us an extra
level of optionality as we enter the next phase of the cycle.
The Southeast has proven to be the winner and it should continue to be the winner in a post-pandemic economy.
Population growth and job growth are remarkably strong. And that's driving real estate values and new home
construction.
SouthState operates in four of the six fastest growing states in the country. And with the recent announcements of
several new multibillion dollar electric vehicle plants and battery plants, and with tourism fully recovered, we see
the momentum in the Southeast extending well beyond this decade.
We don't have a crystal ball and we don't know the ramifications of the Fed's policies as hard as we try. But we
are firm believers that granular and relationship-based deposit funding, disciplined underwriting and high growth
markets and an entrepreneurial team of bankers is the recipe for success regardless of the Fed's interest rate
policies.
And with that, I'll flip it back to Will to walk you through the details of the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Thank you, John. I'll go through a few details, but I think a high level summary of the quarter is that we put up a
solid PPNR though our NIM compressed a bit to $362 million. Our deposit costs were in line with where we

expected them to fall. We had forecasted an increase of 45 to 50 basis points and they moved up 48 basis points
from Q1 to 111 basis points.
We had solid growth in both loans and deposits. So we expect our loan growth to slow down in the back half of
the year. Our noninterest income performed well, exceeding our expectations. And conversely, expenses were a
little higher than expected, largely due to some items they're not expected to recur. On the balance sheet, our
11% annualized loan growth brings our first half growth rate to 9%. As I said, we expect this to moderate for the
final two quarters of the year.
Deposits grew at a solid 3.6% annualized rate or 6% if you exclude the approximately $210 million in brokerage
CD maturities we didn't replace. Like others, we continue to see a mix-shift in our deposits from DDA into money
market accounts and CDs.
DDA is represented 31% of our total deposits at quarter end, down from 34% last quarter. Pre-pandemic, this
figure was 28% to 29%. So, we appear to be moving toward pre-pandemic levels of DDA as a percentage of
deposits.
Turning to the income statement, our $362 million was down 31 basis points from Q1. Loan yields were up 15
basis points, but deposits were up 48 basis points, bringing our cycle-to-date deposit beta to 22%. Our net
interest income of $362 million was approximately equal to what we reported for the 2022 third quarter.
Non-interest income was up $6 million to $77 million, the best quarter we've had since last year's second quarter.
It was led by Correspondent, which had $19 million in revenue after $8 million in interest expense on swap
collateral for $27 million and gross revenue. This continues to be a difficult environment for fixed income, but our
interest rate swap business had a very good quarter. Mortgage and wealth had solid quarters similar to Q1 levels
and deposit fees recovered to levels we saw in Q4.
As I said, expenses came in higher than expected this quarter. A few factors impacting the quarter's NIE.
Compensation expense was up $3 million, around half of which was higher commission expense. We recorded
$1.5 million expense accrual for litigation, and we recorded an adjustment for our FDIC assessment during the
quarter to reflect the new assessment rate effective this year.
Our quarterly run rate going forward for FDIC insurance expense should be approximately $7 million, excluding
any special assessment and excluding other regulatory charges. Those two non-recurring items, the litigation
accrual and the FDIC adjustment, along with the higher commission expense total around $5 million.
Looking ahead, our team's annual merit increases are effective July 1. Subject to some variations and expense
categories impacted by non-interest income and performance, we expect operating NIE in the next couple of
quarters to be in the low- to mid-$240 million. With respect to credit, we continued to build loan loss reserves in
the face of a possible recession. With $38 million in provision expense against only $3 million in net charge-offs.
Over the last four quarters, we've averaged 1-basis point in net charge-offs for a total of $4 million while recording
$142 million in provision expense for a $138 million build in total reserves in one year.
This brings our total reserve to just shy of $0.5 billion and 156 basis points of loans, up 30 basis points from a
year ago. We knew the historically low levels of NPAs and criticized and classified loans we've enjoyed the last
few quarters were not sustainable. We saw those metrics tick up a bit in Q2, though they remain at very moderate

levels. I'll note that almost 60% of our non-performing loans are current on payments. Like last quarter, we
included in the presentation some additional credit information on areas of interest.
We continue to have very strong capital ratios with CE Tier 1 above 11% or 9.4% if AOCI were included in the
calculation. Our TCE ratio improved slightly to 7.6%, with capital retention slightly offset by a higher AOCI impact
versus Q1 due to increases in interest rates. As I noted, we expect to see slower loan growth in the next couple of
quarters. So, risk-weighted asset growth should be lower than what we experienced in the second quarter.
With our solid capital position and our capital formation rate, we expect to continue to build and retain capital,
though we may potentially utilize our buyback authorization to repurchase shares should conditions warrant.
Operator, we'll now take questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Catherine Mealor with KBW. Your
line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning.

Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Good morning, Catherine.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I thought I'll start with the margin and just see if we could get an updated thoughts on how you're thinking about
the margin in the back half of the year, the deposit beta has just been so good. And just curious if you think that's
sustainable in the back half of the year if we still have a little bit more of a catch up coming. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yes, Catherine, this is Steve. Thanks for the question. And maybe just to back up for a second. Last quarter our
guidance was really kind of three things. One was interest earning assets around $40 billion. Our deposit costs
were to increase 45 to 50 basis points. They increased 48 basis points, so that was kind of right in line. And then,
the third piece of guidance we said was that, our full year NIM expectation for 2023 would be between 3.60% and
3.70%. And then, of course, second quarter came right in line with that.
So, as we think about going forward the rest of the year, then 2024, there's three really big assumptions around
that, interest earning assets being the first, our rate forecasting in the second, deposit being the third. On the first
one, our interest earning assets is around $40 billion for the full year. We haven't changed that guidance, start out
a little lower. It's trending a little higher, but basically, pretty steady in 2023.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2023
As it relates to the second assumption, our rate forecast, during the April call, we forecasted rates based on the
Moody's baseline to peak at 5.25%. But, of course, based on the latest Fed rate hike this week and the Moody's
consensus, we're expecting Fed funds rate to stay flat at 5.5% through the rest of the year before decreasing in
the first quarter of 2024, and then going to 4.25% by the end of 2024. That's what's built into our forecast.
And then, the last assumption is just around deposit beta. And as we mentioned, we have a page in the deck on
page 19 of our investor deck that shows our cycle-to-date, deposit beta is at 22% versus our historical beta from
last cycle was 24%. In April, we did give guidance that we expect that our deposit beta to finish up in the high
20%s due to the March banking turmoil. We continue to reiterate that expectation based on what we're seeing.
And so, as we think about – based on our interest rate forecast, we would expect deposit cost to increase 30
basis points to 35 basis points in the third quarter. And for the deposit cost to end the year between $150 million
and $160 million in the fourth quarter, which is up about 40 basis points to 50 basis points from the current 2Q
level.
So, you kind of put all that together and in summary, we – based on these assumptions, we expect NIM to be
between $350 million to $360 million in the back half of 2023. And we reiterate our full-year NIM guide of $360
million to $370 million for 2023.
As we think of – going forward and, of course, there's a lot of assumptions going forward in 2024, really, our
biggest change would be just we expect our interest earning asset to grow in 2024. So, we expected to average
around $41 billion for 2024 as we continue to grow loans and continue to grow the balance sheet. And that the
NIM would be relatively stable in that $350 million to $360 million range just based on all those assumptions. So,
that's a longwinded answer to your question, but I think hopefully that encapsulates the margin question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That is really great. Perfect. Thank you so much, Steve. And maybe just thinking about the margins for 2024,
because I think for the rest of the year, it makes perfect sense. But as we think to 2024, I'm assuming loan yields,
is really the biggest factor there. If we assume the Fed stays at $515 million and even cuts in the next year, the
big question is what can loan yields do into next year.
And this quarter, I noticed loan yield changes fell back a little bit from the pace that we've seen in the past couple
of quarters. Any commentary on what drove that? Every quarter can be kind of different. But just maybe can you
give us some thoughts on loan re-pricing and maybe within that guidance where you're thinking loan yields to the
end of the year and upside if we move into next?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah, Catherine, I think last quarter, we answered this sort of question on the call. And I think what we were
talking about that, based on the forecast, we thought loan yield for our total portfolio would end between 5.5% and
5.75% at the fourth quarter. So, there's really no change to that. And that's probably why our NIM guidance really
hasn't really changed a whole lot.
We would expect that the loan yields would continue to increase, one, based on the Fed rate hike, two, based on
new production, and three, the last is just the maturing or re-pricing adjustable fixed rate loans. That represents
about $1 billion a quarter. That is sort of re-pricing, somewhere in that 4.25% to 4.40% range and, of course, over

7%. So those are kind of the three things that give us some confidence in the loan yield continuing to increase
over time.

Operator: Your next question is from the line in Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning, guys. Appreciate it. I guess I appreciate the commentary around $142 million in provisions,
only $4 million in net charge-offs. We can see the reserve build. But are there any other dynamics at play there
that's leading to a little bit more elevated provisions than what maybe – I don't know, I would expect from my side
of things?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yes, Stephen, it's Will. The short answer is the biggest driver to the provision this quarter was the change in the
commercial real estate price index forecast. But let me maybe back up just a second sort of talk about our model.
Our model is built on historical loss data for 60 different bank charters that make up [indiscernible] (00:17:23)
SouthState from the period of 2004 to 2019.
So, obviously, looking at different economic environments, different loss rates that occurred in those different
environments and then running regression analyses. We have to also on top of that though incorporate a
qualitative overlay to account for the different nature of some loan portfolios, particularly construction loan
portfolio, which, as you might imagine, heading into the great financial crisis in the 2000-2010 timeframe was
much more heavily speculative land acquisition and development. It was in some cases definitely well over half of
the construction portfolio. Where today, it's a minuscule fraction almost on an exception-only basis, whereas,
we're doing more industrial and multifamily-type lending in that construction category.
So, we have a qualitative overlay to adjust for that factor. But you have to keep in mind that CECL, it's a forward-
looking measure. And so the increase that we show is not based on what we see in our portfolio, but rather based
upon drivers, the changes in the loss drivers, particularly CRE price index in this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And the big move from the unfunded reserve to the funded, is that about loan fundings or is that still kind of
more model-driven into what you just spoke to, Will?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
It's a combination of the two. Our unfunded portion of the loan commitments is reducing as we're not refilling the
pipeline as much with construction loans. And also just reflects some of the loss drivers in the different segments
and the qualitative overlays.

Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
We tend to view [indiscernible] (00:19:12), we tend to view the total reserves, the 156 basis points versus just the
reserve on the loans themselves. It's all capital set aside to cover loan losses, so.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Absolutely. Yes. Perfect. Okay. And then, on the loan growth guidance, kind of lower in the back half of the year.
That's very consistent, which I appreciate. I know like this quarter looked like Investors CRE and Resi Mortgage
were the two biggest drivers. Is one or both of those falling off more so than anything else? Is that why loan
growth will back off? Or what's kind of – is it just more conservatism? Can you give me some color on that
dynamic?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. It'd the residential loan growth category, Stephen. I mean, that's grown far beyond our forecast for the first
half of the year. Basically in the Southeast, with all this population migration, there's more buyers than sellers.
There's a lack of inventory. So, we've been financing new home construction for end users, not for builders but for
the end users. But we see that residential production moderate in the back half of the years. We just adjust the
mortgage rates higher.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
And Stephen, what I would add is that we have a slide in the deck and I think probably this is last time we put it in
there. But page 35, which speaks to kind of residential loan growth over the past really three years. And what you
notice is when rates are low, we typically sell more in the secondary. When rates are higher, we put more in the
portfolio.
If you looked at that whole three years and you said what's your compounded growth rate over that three-year
period for residential, it's right at 9%. And so as we think about managing our balance sheet and our capital
allocation, we've sort of got it back to where we think the long-term average is and growing at 25% a quarter from
here doesn't make as much sense. So, I think we've kind of allocated what we were going to allocate, now we've
just got to grow it with the rest of the portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yes. That's great. And then just last thing for me. Obviously, the NIM guidance was very detailed. Appreciate that,
Steve. And no pressure on that basis point change quarter-over-quarter. You did so well this quarter, and now

we're all going to expect it to be right again. But I'm wondering, within that guidance, what's the non-interest
bearing deposit percentage look like in your models, in your thinking? Is it 35%, which is phenomenal but down
from 40%. Where do you think that's going to trend from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. So, in our models, we're at 31% at the end of the quarter, which fell from 34% last quarter. And most of
that, of course, which is the business DDA side of it. Prior to 2020, so in the last cycle, we ended up in I think in
that 28%, 29% range. So just based on our forecast, we're getting to that level by the end of the year. So, we
think there's a couple of percent degradation, although like everything else that's going accelerating so much over
the next few quarters is kind of how we're thinking about it.

I was just wondering on the deposit cost headwinds, the level of competition, the mix-shift that we just were
speaking about a minute ago. We've had a few banks cite that they've observed that easing over the course of
the quarter and specifically here in the last in the month of June and coming into July. Is that consistent with what
you're seeing, are you seeing some of those headwinds abating or not necessarily? Is it just as fierce in terms of
the pace that you're dealing with it?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2023
Hi, Kevin, this is Steve. Yeah. That's consistent with what we're seeing. Certainly that can change, but that's really
built into our guidance. Last quarter, we guided between 45 and 50 basis points for the quarter. This year, we're
sort of in the 30 to 35 basis points range. And that's consistent with what we're seeing today and probably
consistent with the industry. Certainly anything else can happen that would move or change that. But right now,
that's sort of where we're seeing it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson Companies
Okay. All right. And, Steve, I apologize if it was said and I missed it, but it was a very good quarter for
Correspondent and capital markets as Will pointed out earlier on the swap side. Can you update us on what your
outlook or how we should be thinking about noninterest income if we're looking at like a run rate in second quarter
of $77.2 million, how we should be thinking about that going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Kevin. You're right. So, with the fee income of $77 million, the way we think about it, 69 basis points of
assets, which was better than our guide of between 55 and 65 basis points. The biggest driver as you mentioned
was Correspondent and really it came down to our interest rate swap revenue.
And if you think about the environment in the second quarter, one of the things that happened was we had much
lower 10-year treasury and then we had some conversions on LIBOR that sort of drove some of the revenue. The
way we're thinking about that business for the back half of the year is sort of back at its first quarter levels
because the 10-year treasury is now picked up to about 4%. So that sort of drives a little bit of that.
As we're thinking about, obviously service charges came up a little bit too. We think that probably comes down a
little bit and it rebounds in the fourth quarter like it usually does. But from here, I think our guidance really hasn't
changed. I think it's, sort of that 55 to 65 basis points for the rest of the year. And then as we think about the – get
clarity on the Fed rate hikes and maybe even potential cuts in 2024, we'd expect in 2024 that the non-interest
income to average assets would start moving up from more in that 60 to 70 basis points due to these interest
rates – interest since the businesses like mortgage and Correspondent, which tend to do a lot better during a
period of stable to lower rate.
So, really no change. We had a really good quarter. We're not expecting quite those levels going forward for at
least the next couple of quarters. But into 2024, we'd expect the sort of rebound back just due to the fact that the
Fed's a little bit more stable.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson Companies
Okay, great. And I think I know the answer to this but just want to ask. You guys are cash flowingly the available
for sale securities. I would imagine at some point AOCI is going to unwind for you. But we've had a few banks pull
the trigger on chunkier bonds, restructuring transactions. And just wondering if that's something that's on the table
or on the radar for you guys given your strong capital that you could kind of accelerate that process or not?
Thanks.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2023
Yeah. Sure, Kevin. I mean, it's certainly something that we've talked about and we always want to keep our
options open because as you know, things change. Yield curve levels change. Shape of the yield curves change.
I think the way we think about it is we're really balancing kind of three things, capital, earnings and liquidity. So, as
we think about NIM potentially stabilizing here, you'd probably see less of a need to do that. But at the same time,
as the yield curve changed and moved down and there was an opportunity, we might want to do it. So I guess
that's really a non-answer. But I think we always look at it. But there's nothing burning that makes us want to do it.
But at the same time there could be an opportunity at some point if the yield curve allows.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, Steve, I just wanted to confirm that the
margin guide that you gave includes purchase accounting accretion, or is that on a core basis? Just trying to
clarify.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. No, it does. It includes all of the above. Purchase accounting accretion continues to move down. You saw it
move down a few million this quarter, I think. And we'd expect that to kind of continue to move down through
2024. So, it really becomes less of a story when you're having several – $300 million worth of NIM. So, I think,
yeah, all that includes everything.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. And I just wanted to circle back to loan growth. One slide that really sticks out to me is slide 5, where you
have kind of a GDP in the footprint, being in line with Japan and above Germany. Why are you guys not giving
your footprint? Why is growth not stronger? I know you said it's kind of decelerating. And some of that's just a
fund up of some of the construction stuff that was on the books that's waning. Is it more of a measured approach
from you all or is it just the market is really – your markets are slowing down and there's just not as many
opportunities? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. I think, Michael, it's a measured approach from our bankers and it's a measured approach from our clients.
Our C&I clients, there's still good business in the marketplace. But as they think about making large strategic
decisions and they're thinking about the implications of an inverted yield curve and a potential recession in 2024,
they're just being more cautious.
And then you go back to CRE. And, clearly, with the interest rate environment like it is, a lot of these deals don't
pencil out for us as underwriters. They don't pencil out for the developers. It requires them to put 45%, 50% cash

in the deals. So, that activity is slowing down. And that's what the Fed is designed. I think that's what the Fed
wants to happen. So, we don't want to fight the Fed here from a growth standpoint.
But I would tell you, as I think about different regions of the country, about the amount of opportunities for loan
growth that we're going to see in the next couple of years I think will be at a faster pace than other areas of the
country. And I think when it comes to potential recessionary risk, it's going to be a lot less in the southeast.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. That's good color, John. I appreciate it. And maybe just one final one for me. You guys are trading around
1.8% of tangible. I know you talked about maybe some buybacks. But we have seen two kind of larger deals this
week. I mean, what's the outlook for M&A here just given that you have a stronger currency? And if you were to
look at something, I mean, is there a preferred size range? Would you consider an MOE? I think there's going to
be a lot of interesting things that happen. But we just love your overall thoughts on how you view M&A at this
point. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
I think those two deals kind of caught everybody a little bit by surprise last week. In the short term, there are
obvious headwinds, the economic uncertainty, the interest rate markets on this deal math, and then the regulatory
approval process is just too long. So, that's the short term. But from a long-term standpoint, the logic is there. If
we've got an inverted yield curve and there's continued revenue pressures. And we're starting to see, Michael, a
dispersion of multiples that could drive a good accretion in M&A.
But really, our guidance hasn't changed. As we think about good partners for us, ideally we would like to partner
with banks that are about 10% to a third of our size. Our preference geographically would be to double down in
the great markets that we're in. And if we ever look to expand into an area outside of our market, we'd want it to
be similar high growth markets that we're already in.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2023
I was hoping to maybe just dig in a little bit more granularly on the margin. I was wondering, Steve, do you guys
have any loan just because the loan yield – I know is still kind of on track to kind of get into the range you
outlined. But it came up a little bit less than what I was looking for. And so, is there any – I guess within kind of the
$9 billion-plus unfunded commitment that you have? Is there anything that's like funding up that as maybe coming
on at yields that we're agreed to a year ago or something like that that's a bit below the market right now that's
kind of stopping that loan yield from moving towards the high end of the $575 million that you expect?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
It's a good question. I think some of this has to do with the number of days in a quarter and all those kinds of
things. You think about the first quarter, for instance. One of the things that can drive some distortion maybe is
just around like February is a 28-day month and you have [ph] 30 – 3.60% (00:33:11) loans that sort of make that
yield a little higher, there's things like that. I don't think there's anything back to what we forecasted last quarter
and what we're forecasting this quarter hasn't changed for kind of the back half of the year.
So, I don't think there's anything that we're seeing that kind of keeps us from being in that $550 million to $575
million range by the end of the year based on what we see. But some of that is – our models have re-pricing in
them and ones that adjust with our loans that are maturing, those kinds of things. But there's nothing in there that
I think is unusual or, anything that – the question you asked, I don't have right off the top of my head. I don't think
there's anything that's really driving them.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And then, I did also want to ask on the opposite side of the ledger, just the transactional Money
Market cost of deposits. They're up again, but they held in, I think, quite a bit better than some of your peers. And
so, I was wondering kind of what the interest rate you're paying on Money Market is for kind of negotiated rates
with your business clients or just a broad kind of average rate, like any detail you can give us there would be
helpful?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. Obviously, so much of that remix this quarter was in the business DDA going into Business Money Market.
So, that's that. And then, as it relates to the rates that are paid on those particular accounts, is really driven by so
much of it being relationship pricing. And so, it really – the answer is, it depends. I think our average money
market rate for the quarter was in the high – maybe 2.70%, 2.80% kind of range.
And, of course, you saw a huge remix into – from Business Money Market – or Business DDA to Business Money
Market. So I would – I guess, the question really that you're asking is, when does that slowdown? So, if we have
another 3% or so that moves in, you could continue to see that money market rate move up.
I remember looking back and this is a long time and it was different bank, but 2007 when Fed funds was around
5.25%, our money market average rate was in the 3% range. So, it doesn't surprise me a whole lot that we're sort
of trending towards that at the end of this rate hiking cycle. But obviously, this cycle has been different. And so it's
hard to predict, but that's maybe some data points for you.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2023
Okay. Could I ask just on that remix that's happening from the business checking to the Business Money Market?
We can see that pretty well on the end of period balance sheet. But those two categories get consolidated for the
average balance sheet. And so did any of that happen later in the quarter that might have influenced the cost of
deposit being lower than we should expect going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
I think the events of March really kicked in some of that remix in April and probably May and certainly to a lesser
extent June. So, I think back to our earlier comments on the cost of deposits, what other banks are seeing and
sort of that a little bit of a deceleration. I would say that probably most of that was maybe a little bit – it was all
throughout the quarter. But I'd say more heavily weighted toward April and May versus June.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And I just had a couple left. Will, I guess the litigation expense, was that for anything specific? I was
just kind of wondering what that was. And then the guidance you gave for expenses, the low-$240 million to mid-
$240 million, it implies just a small, but it implies a step up in the expense guide just a little bit off of the full year
$950 million that you had talked about before. Is there anything specific that's kind of driving that as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yes. So, the litigation accrual was related to the settlement of a case from – that's been out there for a while. And
we had it accrued for mediation and finally got it settled. So that's accrued up for that amount. The expense guide,
yeah, that is little bit above that $950 million range if you put them all together. I'd say the hard thing to predict
there as you know, one, would be variable compensation expense associated with some of the variable revenue
business lines, commission, et cetera. That's a component that depends upon those. The other is loan production
volume impacts the FAS 91 loan origination cost deferral as well.
So, that's one that's hard to predict. If loan volume slows down, you'll have less of that as an NIE offset. Those will
be two of the things. And then, as you go through the year, you are first going to chew up your incentive
compensation through the rest of the year. And that's one that has some variability to it. So, that's all. Those are
some of the things that are in there that lead to that being a range like it is.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you for that detail. And then the last one I had was, I did notice that when I was kind of comparing
the investor CRE sides quarter-over-quarter, I did notice that there was a step up in substandard and special
mention office portfolio. I wanted to ask if that was a result of any reappraisals that you had done or if it was
something different.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. Brody, it's the second quarter of the year. So, this is when we get in a lot of the year-end financial
statements. So we've been actively doing this normal servicing of the commercial loan portfolio. And to your point,
on page 25, you can kind of see that over the last year special mention loans have been trending lower,
substandard loans have drifted higher. If you put it all together, we're roughly flat from about where we were a
year ago.

But we are seeing a mix and I think it's predictable. We've been upgrading hotel loans coming out of the
pandemic. And we've been putting some of the office deals on watch. If you look at our NPAs today, nearly 60%
of – I think Will said this in the prepared remarks. Nearly 60% of them are current on payments. About $19 million
have a government guarantee. There were two C&I credits that migrated to non-performers in the second quarter.
One we feel pretty good about, we don't think there's a loss. The other one might have a charge in the third
quarter. But based upon what we know today, we should finish the calendar year with total charge-offs, probably
at or below 10 basis points.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Bishop with the Hovde Group. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I guess one final
question maybe on the new loan origination deals, just curious where you saw those trending this quarter relative
to last? And are you seeing any differential or better pricing in some of your markets than others? Just curious
what you're seeing overall in terms of new loan origination yields?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah, David, this is Steve. They did improve for the quarter. And I guess I don't have the data right in front of me,
as far as where they trended up from in the first quarter. But part of it is I do have residential loan yields, which I
think was in the 6.20% range, give or take. And so as we think about the commercial loan yields are much higher
than that.
And so as we think about moderating the loan growth in the back half of the quarter, most of that's going to be in
residential. We'll start seeing that new loan yield probably be over 7% is probably where we're thinking. I think
we're in the high 6s give or take in the second quarter. But as we kind of move residential down, which is a lower
yielding where we think it's safe for assets, really it will move us back towards that 7% is kind of where we are
thinking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got it. And then, one final question, the guidance in terms of loan yield expectations, I hear it was $550 million to
$575 million?

Yeah. Just to be clear, that would be in the fourth quarter. And we would expect it to move kind of in between
here and there in the third quarter. So, that's all part of the margin guidance. But yeah, we would expect the loan
yield to be roughly in that range by the end of the year.
