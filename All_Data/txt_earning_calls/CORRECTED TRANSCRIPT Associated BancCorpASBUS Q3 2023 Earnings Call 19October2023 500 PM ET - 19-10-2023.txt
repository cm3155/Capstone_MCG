Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I'm Andy Harmening. I am joined once again
by Derek Meyer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Pat Ahern, our Chief Credit Officer. I will start today by sharing
some highlights for the quarter. From there, Derek will provide an update on margin, income, capital trends and
then Pat will share an update on credit.
Now, I mentioned back in July that we were starting to see renewed stability after a volatile Spring. And what we
saw here at Associated in the third quarter was a definitive continuation of those stabilizing trends. Employment
trends remain very strong in our footprint, with most Midwestern states seen unemployment below the national
average and Wisconsin coming in below 3%. Our prime and super prime retail customers remain resilient in the
face of macro uncertainty. What this means for us is that we've been able to focus squarely on execution of our
initiatives as we look to attract and deepen customer relationships, optimize our balance sheet and improve our
profitability profile. These initiatives have clearly taken hold in the face of challenging operating environments.
On the asset side, we've steadily added high-quality consumer and commercial loan balances that enable us to
rely less heavily on lower yielding non-relationship balances.
On the funding side, the customer acquisition and attrition trends we shared for Q2 look even stronger in Q3.
Initiatives, such as our new Mass Affluent Strategy, product enhancements and brand campaign are clearly
having an impact and that led to $527 million in core customer deposit growth during the third quarter. This not
only helps us fund our loan growth, but it enables us to decrease our reliance on wholesale and network funding
sources now and in the future.
And finally, on the digital side, we've regularly upgraded our online and mobile experiences since we launched our
new platform a year ago. These changes have contributed significantly to higher customer satisfaction scores and
decreased customer attrition.
And while we've continued to get traction since launching Phase 1 of our strategic plan, a little bit over two years
ago, we haven't lost sight of what got us here in the first place, our foundational discipline on credit quality and
expense management. As the banking environment continues to evolve in the coming quarters, that discipline is
going to remain front and center for us. It's also important that we're thoughtful about what comes next for
Associated Bank as we look to set the bank up for long-term success. That's why our team is working hard,
putting the finishing touches on Phase 2 of our strategic plan, which we look forward to sharing in more detail later
this quarter.
With that, I'd like to highlight our results for the third quarter on slide 2.
Our third quarter results reflected the steady growth of our balance sheet and continued progress against our
initiatives. As mentioned in the past, our stated goal is to fund the majority of our growth with core customer
deposits. We grew these deposits meaningfully in 2022. And after a period of industry-wide volatility in the first
half of this year, core customer deposits grew by over $500 million here in Q3 as we continued to realize the
impacts of our customer acquisition and relationship deepening initiatives. This enabled us to pay down high-cost
non-customer funding sources like brokered CD's during the quarter.
On the loan side, all three of our major consumer and commercial loan segments once again saw net balanced
growth during the quarter led by growth in our auto finance business. With that said, it's clear that lending activity
has slowed in most categories as compared to 2022.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Shifting to the income statement. Funding costs continued to be a pressure point for the entire industry in this rate
environment. Here at Associated, however, the pace of downward pressure on margin has slowed. In Q3, our
NIM decreased by 9 basis points to 2.71%.
For the third quarter, we saw a slight increase in our noninterest income. Our third quarter noninterest income
grew by 2% versus the prior quarter, partially offsetting the ongoing pressure on NII.
And as always, we're continuing to monitor asset quality closely. Our net charge-off ratio came in at 25 basis
points for the quarter as we added another $22 million in provision and held our ACLL ratio flat at 1.26%.
While several key credit metrics have ticked up slightly compared to the prior quarter, we considered the data to
be consistent with a gradual normalization to pre-COVID performance levels. We have not seen anything to
suggest trouble on the horizon for specific industry or geography.
On slide 3, we highlight our deposit trends for the third quarter. As you know, industry-wide volatility in the spring
combined with an ongoing battle for deposits to create significant funding headwinds for the first half of the year,
while much of the volatility cleared up by June, short-term funding and liquidity pressures, combined with the mix
shift in customer accounts, had a lingering impact on Q2 balance flows. We continued to see some impact from
mix shift during the quarter, but the situation is largely stabilized, providing a clearer view of the impacts from our
deposit gathering initiatives that started to take hold in 2022.
During the quarter, we saw net growth in both consumer and commercial balances. And core customer deposits,
as a whole, grew by $527 million or 2%. This growth enabled us to decrease our reliance on higher cost network
and brokered deposits, which decreased by $418 million or 8% during the quarter. As a reminder, our strategy is
to fund our loan growth primarily with customer deposits. We expect to hold wholesale network funding levels in
check as we move through the remainder of the year and into 2024. And we remain confident in our ability to fund
our growth at a reasonable cost going forward based on our initiatives.
Based on year-to-date trends and current market conditions, we're affirming our guidance and continue to expect
total core customer deposits to decrease by 3% for 2023, but increase by 2% in the back half of the year.
On slide 4, you can see that the deposit growth hasn't come by accident. As we've discussed previously, our team
has been hard at work to enhance our offerings with an eye towards attracting new relationships, deepening
existing relationships and increasing retention. It's clear at this point, our initiatives have taken hold. Since 2022,
we focused on upgrading product and service offerings and have promoted these new offerings with a customer-
centric brand strategy.
As of the third quarter, our consumer household acquisition rate was up 20% versus the same period a year ago.
And our attrition rate was down 17%. Digital has also been instrumental to our success. And through the open
architecture of our new platform, we've been able to move more quickly to deploy upgrades and enhancements to
make our customers' lives easier. In a little more than a year since the platform launched, we've had 99.9%
uptime and have already made 11 customer-facing upgrades leading to a multiyear high in customer satisfaction
scores.
And finally, since launching a new Mass Affluent Strategy to deepen relationships with high potential customers,
we've already added over $550 million in net new deposits, nearly doubling our full year goal by September 30.
This growth represents a roughly 12% increase in our pre-launched baseline.

So as we've said, our plan is to fund our loan growth with core customer relationships, deposit relationships, and
we've steadily continued to execute this plan in the face of a challenging funding environment. As a result, we're
bringing in new dollars and deepening relationships with a customer base that is more satisfied.
Shifting to slide 5. We've steadily added high-quality loan balances to our portfolio with another $344 million
added here in the third quarter. This marks the six consecutive quarters, in which all three of our major loan
segments have reported net growth.
While growth has continued throughout the year, the pace of growth has slowed. And it's clear that pipelines have
also slowed as customers make a more cautious approach in what appears to be a higher for longer rate
environment. During the third quarter, we again saw moderate growth in our auto finance portfolio, where we
continued to focus squarely on prime and super prime clientele. As a reminder, we do not intend to become
disproportionately reliant on auto loans, but the portfolio continues to provide us a high-quality, yield-friendly
option to diversify our consumer loan book away from lower yielding non-relationship assets such as third-party
originated mortgage.
On the commercial side, our mortgage warehouse business led the way during Q3, but that's not something we
would expect to become a theme. Looking forward, it's clear that the lending environment has begun to slow for
the industry, but we continue to seek selective growth that emphasizes relationships, quality and diversification,
while delivering accretive returns. This enables us to deemphasize lower yielding non-relationship asset classes
over time. Given the slowdown in the lending environment, we now expect total loan growth of between 5% and
6% for 2023.
So finally on slide 6, our team once again paired solid revenues with diligent expense management during the
third quarter. Given the funding pressures facing the industry, our PTPP income dipped to $125 million or $8
million lower than the second quarter. But despite these funding pressures, our year-to-date PTPP income is $68
million higher in 2023 than it was in 2022 a 20% increase.
With that, I'll hand it over to Derek Meyer, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide further detail on our margin,
income statement and capital trends for the quarter. Derek?

Derek S. Meyer
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Andy. I'll start by highlighting our asset and liability rate trends during the third quarter on slide 7. Our
total asset yields have continued to rise due to rising rates and the repricing nature of a large segment of our loan
book. Since the start of the rate cycle, total earning asset yields have increased by 277 basis points, or roughly
53% of the increase of Fed funds target rate over the same period.
Commercial and CRE yields have grown the most as we continue to add new loans and categories, such as
asset-based lending and equipment finance, while our floating rate back book continues to reprice higher.
On the liabilities side, rising rates, liquidity pressures and a mix shift in customer deposits have converged to
create significant funding cost pressure for the whole industry. While these pressures have stabilized meaningfully
in Q3, they continue to pose a challenge for profitability in the near-term. Here at Associated interest-bearing
liability costs have now increased by 309 basis points since the fourth quarter of 2021.

Specific to deposit betas, the S-curve, we were planning to see in the rising rate environment has largely played
out as expected, but the shape of the curve has steepened meaningfully in 2023, amid the funding cost pressures
described previously. As such, our interest-bearing deposit beta has now climbed to roughly 56% since the start
of the rate cycle.
Moving to slide 8, the funding cost pressures facing the industry combined to drive a 9-basis point compression in
our NIM in Q3. While pressures remain, we view this trend as a clear sign of stabilization compared to margin
trends in the first half of the year. This stabilization was also demonstrated by our dollar net interest income,
which decreased by just $4 million after significant pressure in Q1 and Q2. As we've mentioned previously,
however, we're not relying solely on the rate environment to dictate our earnings going forward.
We benefited from a natural asset sensitivity over the past couple of years as rates have risen, but we've also
taken actions on both sides of the balance sheet to decrease our sensitivity and drive more durable interest
income in future quarters. Whether it's adding high-quality customer loans, core customer deposits, or layering in
interest rate hedges, these actions have been designed to provide our company with additional flexibility to
maintain our performance through the cycle.
As a reminder, we do not intend to call the peak on the interest rate environment in the near-term, but we will
continue to take reasonable steps over time to manage our asset sensitivity and downside rate risk.
As you can see on the right-hand side of this slide, these efforts have gradually decreased our asset sensitivity
over the past several quarters. We expect to continue benefiting in a rising rate or higher for longer scenario, but
we're also better positioned for an eventual decrease in rates over time.
The macro outlook remains uncertain, but based on our current expectations for balance sheet growth, deposit
betas and Fed action, we now expect net interest income growth of between 8% and 10% in 2023.
On slide 9, we continued to manage our securities book in the third quarter to remain within our 18% to 20%
target. Since the third quarter of 2022, the yield on our securities book has risen by 74 basis points, but we
continue to rein in our durations to reduce our longer term rate risk.
After adjusting our CET1 capital ratio to include the impacts of AOCI, this impact would have represented 101
basis point hit to CET1 in the third quarter. This impact is up slightly from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the
rebound in rates.
As a percentage of total assets, our investment, security and cash positions were maintained to roughly 20% for
the second straight quarter. We continue to target investments to total assets of between 18% and 20% in 2023.
On slide 10, we highlight our noninterest income trends. Despite the downward pressure from market-driven
headwinds and adjustments to our fee structure, noninterest income grew modestly for the third straight quarter
and landed at $67 million. The primary factors for the quarter-over-quarter increase were $1 million increase in
asset gains and modest increases in service charges and deposit account fees and wealth management fees.
With that said, we continue to expect total 2023 noninterest income to contract by between 8% and 10% versus
2022. As a reminder, this anticipated compression is driven by current market dynamics and moderation in
deposit account fee income due to [ph] OD, NSF (00:17:03) changes we made in the back half of 2022.

Moving to slide 11, our third quarter expenses increased by 3% versus the prior quarter, but were flat with the
same period a year ago. We continue to make targeted investments in people and technology to support our
initiatives. Our FTE efficiency ratio rose to 58.5% during the quarter, but it remains 29 basis points below lower
than the same period a year ago. Additionally, our noninterest expense base has remained below 2% as a
percent of average assets and is now down 18 basis points from the same period last year.
While we continue to invest in strategies to support our growth aspirations in 2023, we are committed to keeping
expense growth below revenue growth over the long-term. On an ongoing basis, we will continue to pursue
opportunities to optimize our expense base where possible.
With that in mind, we expect total noninterest expense growth of between 3% and 4% in 2023, but would note that
this number excludes the impact of any nonrecurring items incurred in the fourth quarter, such as FDIC's special
assessment.
Shifting to slide 12, we continue to prioritize paying a competitive dividend and funding organic growth, while
managing capital levels towards the target ranges. During the third quarter, our capital ratios grew versus the prior
quarter and versus year end 2022. We remain comfortable with our capital levels as we look out over the
remainder of the year.
Given current market conditions and the expectation for short-term rates to remain elevated in the near-term, we
continue to expect TCE to land in the 6.75% to 7.25% range by year end. We've increased the upper end of our
CET1 target range and are now targeting a range of 9% to 9.75%.
I'll now hand it over to our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern to provide an update on credit quality.

Patrick E. Ahern

Thanks, Derek. I'd like to start on slide 13 with an update on our allowance trends. We utilized the Moody's
August 2023 baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline forecast
remains consistent with a resilient economy, despite the high interest rate environment. The baseline forecast
contains no additional rate hikes, slower, but positive GDP growth rates, a cooling labor market and a continued
deceleration of inflation.
Our ACLL increased by $4 million during the quarter to $381 million. Our allowance continues to be driven by a
combination of portfolio loan growth, nominal credit movement and general macroeconomic trends that reflect the
stability of our Midwest footprint. Accordingly, our reserves to loans ratio remained flat to the prior quarter and 6
basis points higher than the same period a year ago at 1.26%.
Moving to slide 14, our quarterly credit trends remained relatively stable across the portfolio during the third
quarter, with migration reflecting a broad-based normalization in portfolio performance. We did see moderate
increases in nonaccrual loans, delinquencies and charge-offs during the third quarter, but as previously
discussed, we anticipated these shifts as a sign of normalization back to pre-pandemic levels as opposed to an
indication of broader issues in the portfolio. As Andy mentioned, we have not seen anything to suggest a pattern
of credit stress in a specific industry or geography.
We added another $22 million in provision during the third quarter, which matches our second quarter provision
build and is consistent with the past four quarters. As mentioned, this provision build was largely a function of loan
growth, limited credit movement and macro trends.

We remain focused on monitoring the uncertainty of the macro economy to ensure current underwriting reflects
elevated inflation, supply chain disruption and labor cost to name just a few economic concerns. In addition, we
continue to maintain specific attention to the effects of elevated interest rates on the portfolio, including ongoing
interest rate sensitivity analysis bank-wide.
Going forward, we expect any provision adjustments to continue to reflect changes to risk grades, economic
conditions, loan volumes and other indications of credit quality.
On slide 15, I remind you that our conservative approach to credit has been optimized over the course of the past
several years, as we've built a diverse portfolio of high-quality commercial loans and a focus on prime and super
prime consumer portfolio.
While CRE has been cited as an area of risk in the media over the past several quarters, we feel well-positioned
given the conservative approach we've applied across the bank. In building our CRE portfolio, we focused on
partnering with well-known developers in stable Midwest markets. Over two-thirds of our portfolio is based in the
Midwest, with an emphasis on multifamily and industrial properties.
Office loans represent just 3.4% of our total loans as a bank, and within that portfolio, we are weighted towards
suburban Class A properties. While we feel well-positioned, given our business model approach and the markets
we operate in, we continue to monitor this and all of our portfolios closely
With that, I will now hand it back to Andy to share some closing thoughts.

Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thank you. I'd like to close out by reiterating a couple of key points from our presentation on slide 16. First, we've
set ourselves up to drive quality, relationship-focused loan growth that decreases our reliance on lower yielding
non-relationship balances and enhances our profitability profile. However, given the recent slowdown in the
lending environment, we now expect the total loan growth of between 5% and 6% in 2023.
Second, the deposit environment has clearly stabilized following a volatile first half of the year. The stabilized
environment, combined with our deposit initiatives, drove strong core customer deposit growth in the third quarter.
With that said, we're leaving our guidance unchanged for the full year, given the seasonality we typically see in
balance flows as we approach year end.
Shifting to revenue, we've adjusted our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth, deposit betas and rate
environment. We now expect to deliver net interest income growth between 8% and 10% in 2023.
And lastly, our disciplined approach to expenses remains a foundational focus for our company. As such, we're
maintaining our noninterest expense guidance for the year, but would note that this guidance excludes
nonrecurring items incurred in Q4, such as the FDIC's special assessment.
With that, let's open up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank
you. Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Tamayo with Raymond James. Please proceed with your
question.

Hi. Good afternoon, everybody.

Hey, Danny.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Maybe first just on the non-accruals, the increase in C&I. I know you mentioned, there was not really a pattern to
that increase, but if it's just a normalization of credit costs, just curious how you're thinking about what we should
or how we should be thinking about what normalization of net charge-offs or even provision could look like?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I would say in terms of net charge-offs, we saw a little bit of a spike this quarter, but I think, last quarter was
probably a little more normal than what we saw this quarter. I think these are just a handful of things. I think, non-
accruals could be – going forward, we're going to watch as credits normalize back, where they settle at, it's hard
to say right now. And for provision, we're probably pretty consistent over the last couple of quarters. And I would
expect similar pattern.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then looking at the loan growth, I'm just curious what thought is in terms of future loan growth,
where that might come from? And then, if you could touch on where new loan yields are for those categories, it'd
be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. This is Derek. So, obviously, the auto has been pretty steady and we expect that to continue. We haven't
moved the credit box. It's getting bigger. So you would normally expect the rate of growth to drop, but we also
expanded into our footprint states and so the dollar increases are steady.
I think this quarter, like most quarters, we expected balanced growth. So we would have, in our prior guidance
that we just took down, expected similar growth in C&I. And while we continue to have more new names this year
and grow that year-over-year because of our [indiscernible] (00:26:57), we saw the back of our pipeline not

replenish and pull through into additional fundings at the pace we saw earlier in the year. And so that has pulled
through in our guidance. And then we'll think about how we position that for next year when we give our 2024
guidance. We really haven't been sharing our new production yields, so I won't go there, but that's how things are
materializing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
But I'll say, Daniel, this is Andy. With regards to portfolio growth, it's important to know where you're growing and
where you're not. And where we're not growing is on the third-party originated mortgages. And that by far has
been the lowest yielding portfolio that we have. So when we stopped the origination of that portfolio, which in its
peak, I believe in 2020, was just around a $1.5 billion in production than a $1 billion and then we shut it down. So
basically, you'll see a runoff on the balance sheet or a decrease in that category, which means that our residential
real estate most likely won't grow at the pace of the market. We believe that over time we'll be able to replace that
with quality C&I business.
Today, clearly CRE is a very stable low to no growth category, although paydowns have been a little bit slow. So I
think over time, you'll see that in the C&I. With regards to fourth quarter numbers, we just took a hard look at our
pipeline and we also took a hard look at relationships that may not have before relationships. And so we won't
extend or be aggressive in those that are lower yielding and those that are not full relationships and usually those
are tied together. So that's a little bit of the reason that we've adjusted the year end forecast on full growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, a high-level question. You touched on third-party origination mortgages,
but I guess just for that asset class overall, have you thought about or would it – is there a way that it might make
sense to sell perhaps some of those loans to kind of reset the margin to a certain extent? Or is there a breakeven
point or a place where rates could get to where that could be more attractive?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, I mean, Dan, you know it's been a pretty interesting market the last six months. And so, over that period of
time, we've looked at every loan category, we've looked at every security, we've looked at tranches of tranches.
And what I would say is we know our portfolio as well as we could know it right now. If there comes a time when
there's an opportunity in one of those tranches, we'll be prepared for that. Right now, we're not prepared to speak
to that.

Jon G. Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Looking at slide 8, and I don't know if this is Derek or Andy, but it – can you talk about just the cadence of
when you think your margin might bottom out? I mean, when I look at slides 8 and slide 7, it sure seems like some
of the pressure on interest-bearing liabilities is starting to fade a little bit and you're getting the asset repricing. But
would you guys say we're at or near a bottom on your margin?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, Jon, it's a good question. I can tell you I feel a lot more certainty than I did on March 10. When we look at
the last few months, it's been pretty interesting. The one encouraging sign, several encouraging signs, I would
say, is we've seen a decrease. I talked about the decrease in attrition that we've experienced, that helps us
understand what the volatility is going to be. We've seen a – I think we're pretty near the bottom on our
noninterest-bearing deposit percentage. We don't see it going down significantly from where it is.
And that slowdown that we saw this quarter, we actually expect it to slow down again in the fourth quarter. And
that's why we have confidence that we're getting near the bottom.
We think knowing that that noninterest-bearing is where it is, then the question becomes, what is your asset
growth? What can you put on at higher yields? And that's what is to be determined what the market will allow. We
won't force it. We're not going to force growth for growth's sake as we go into the end of this year and the
beginning of next year. But we think there will be some modest growth out there for us. When you put that in at
higher yields, that, of course, takes the place of what creates less pressure on that margin. So we expect the
margin pressure to continue to decrease in the fourth quarter. We do believe that in 2024, we will see an inflection
point in there. Of course, it's based on multiple variables, but the number one positive that I see right now is hitting
a terminal number or getting close to the terminal number on noninterest-bearing deposits.

Okay. That's helpful though. Slide 3 on the customer CDs versus brokered CDs, can you talk a little bit about what
you did there? And how you attracted the customer CD balances? And should we expect more of that in the next
couple of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Our customers' CD balances have been largely the same rates for quite some time, I think even towards
the end of the last quarter. And in fact, now we're toying with the idea of dropping the promo rates a little bit this
quarter to see if we can continue to hold. It sounds like we're getting some interference, but to see if we can
continue to hold the production. So that strategy has worked well. And we've stayed fairly short. Most of our
production all along this year has been in the seven months CD. And in fact really that's about the only story
there.
The brokered CDs, we've stayed short all along. When we first went into them after Silicon Valley, we mostly went
into three months with for almost everything. And then as things progressed and we wanted to make sure we had
secured funding coverage, that grew a little bit more and then we just spread out the maturity buckets so that we
don't have a large lump anywhere. And then as we get exiting our short-term deposit growth or long-term deposit
growth, we have the option each month and whether you want to roll over a piece or just pay it down. And that
was very helpful this quarter, obviously.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
And so, I'll maybe expand on that even a little bit, Jon. You started with how we've attracted customers in CDs.
And I would even stop that question shorter and say how we attracted customers. And when I look at one thing
that gives me confidence heading into 2024 is we have made purposeful actions towards product, marketing,
digital in our approach to business. What we're seeing is we are reversing literally in the process of reversing a
multiyear trend on customer growth. And it's going in the right direction and we've reversed that trend. And what
many would argue is one of the most volatile years we've had for regional banks in the past decade.
So when we look at that, those customers, when you marry that customer growth with customer deepening
tactics, whether that goes into a CD, whether that is managing the back end tranche of a CD or whether that goes
into a money market, whether it goes in the noninterest-bearing, there's no doubt that when you have customer
growth, you create a tailwind for yourselves. So in a market that is normalizing to some extent, we've put
ourselves through the initiatives we've had in a pretty good position on the foundational customer growth.

we expect when you give us the Phase 2?

October, going into November. We will be in the fourth quarter just as fast as we can put the right accurate

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to take another stab on the NII. So it looks
like there's a fairly wide range of possible outcomes for the fourth quarter, anywhere from down just a bit to
actually up several percentage points. I guess just sort of in your view, what would have to happen for NII to have
bottomed out at the current level? I know there must be some confidence that it may have bottomed out or could
even go higher. I mean, what are sort of the puts and takes as you sort of think about that range of outcomes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
So the way things look right now – Scott, this is Derek. The rate of noninterest-bearing DDA run-off and the
impact that had on our margin abated considerably. That was really a bigger story in Q1 and Q2. And so you still
got a fair amount of low cost deposits moving into higher cost deposit products. That was probably a little stronger
than we thought.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
For things to bottom out, you really need to get to a spot and this is where most of the longer range scenarios
start to look like for us, even with a few rate cuts next year. Where loans continue to reprice, we've got a big fixed
rate book and those – as the old ones reprice into paydown and new ones get booked in at much higher rates,
particularly in auto and then the deposits finally stabilize. And so, you see us – you see these scenarios where
you get 2 or 3 or 4 basis points of asset rate increases. And because those mix change and a little bit of rate
curve and then you just see the deposits stop increasing and that abating. We think there's a big psychological
lever there if the Fed stops raising rates, because consumers don't look at the back of the yield curve and think
about should they be doing something else with their money as much as they do the headlines that continue of
rising rates?
When that happens, you can start to model out slower increases in deposit rates than the repricing of the fixed
rate loans. It's very subtle. That's why it's hard to call. You can be off by a couple of basis points and it goes the
other way on you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Thank you for that color. And then I guess, Andy, just I guess maybe the answer is stay
tuned to December. But I know in the past, you've alluded quite a few times to the importance of positive
operating leverage creation. Are you thinking that that's something that's kind of important and doable in 2024? Or
should we sort of think about it? Or like the way you think about it, is that sort of broader is important over the
long-term as opposed to in each individual year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, I'll take a lot for me to give up on that in 2024. So for any of my own colleagues listening, I'll tell you, that's
our goal for 2024. And so, we're looking at both sides. We're looking at what the expense side is and we're
looking what are our investment, strategic investment, when we start to look at the shift in our balance sheet. And
my question to the team will be is how fast can we do it? And part of that's market driven. And part, it's execution.
On the execution front, I'm gaining a lot of confidence in our leadership team. They've shown their ability to
execute over the period since we've launched that initial plan in September of 2021, albeit we had an interesting
four or five months this year. But you can see the fundamentals still coming through. So as we put that plan
together, the challenge put out to the team is to try to drive towards positive operating leverage in 2024.
We'll see what the market looks like and what that allows. But that is the message of what we're trying to work for.
We don't have the final numbers in place yet for 2024. But that's still the direction.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thank you. Thanks, Andy. Going back to the increase in commercial nonaccruals and I saw at the end of the
release that potential problem loans. I think they were investor CRE. How much of that increase would fall in the
legacy bucket versus new lending relationships since the end of 2021? And maybe give you a platform to push
back on some of the fears out there that associated with a late cycle grower and commercial and as such may
see, I'll call it, a faster normalization of credit trends?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. We're not seeing that at all in what's happened this last quarter. We had a handful of deals that moved into
nonaccrual. And I think I don't see any of the growth we went through the last couple of years isn't coming back to
haunt us. In terms of some of the migration, we've got our real estate book, we feel is really still holding up strong.
The real estate asset class is – still gets hit by rising interest rates. You've got inflationary pressures, whether it'd
be on insurance, real estate taxes, all the operating expenses that go in there. So I think there's still – we're still
comfortable with how they're weathering the storm. But there's – as you – these costs remain elevated, there'll be
a little more added pressure there.
But on our real estate book, the stuff we're doing is with longstanding relationships. We're not out doing
transactional work with one-off customers. These are relationships we've targeted and grown throughout the
years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patrick E. Ahern A

Yeah, really. I mean, in terms of nonaccruals, we haven't seen a lot in real estate. I mean, it's really been more on
the C&I side that moved the needle here this quarter. We've had some pretty strong stable performance in the
book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp

Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
...quarters and net charge-offs have been negative over that five quarter period. So if that would be the specific
question, Terry, we see no evidence of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Right. And then maybe just a follow-up. I think Scott and Jon asked a similar question. Does the fourth quarter
expense guide – I saw non-reoccurring items, I was thinking related to the Phase 2 of the strategic plan, not the
FDIC expense. So does the fourth quarter guide reflect any strategic Phase 2 expenses? And will we see a step-
up in expenses next year due to this announcement that will come out this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I'll speak to – even though we haven't given guidance on 2024, our approach has been the same each of the last
two years. We've gone into each year and when I came in this role, folks suggested that maybe there was no
room to cut. There's always room to cut. There's always room to cut for the next best investment that you need to
make. We've made those in each of the last two years. We see opportunity for investment right now. And before
we do that, we see opportunity to decrease expenses in some areas. So that will be the approach that we have
when we think about new initiatives. People say, Gosh, you're going to have very high expenses. We have not in
two years. We will not in next year. So that's what allows me to feel like we're in the game with regards to positive
operating leverage next year, even though we need to fine tune and see where we end up.
With regards to expenses, we don't necessarily have any extraordinary initiative spike in the fourth quarter as a
result of initiatives that we're planning.

Hi. Good afternoon.

Hi, Timur.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Looking at the auto finance book, I'm just wondering how close that book is to reaching a point of maturity,
meaning that you're starting to have some loans payoff? I'm assuming that starts to accelerate somewhat in 2024.
And as that process happens, I'm just wondering what your expectation for growth is there. Is it expansion into
some newer markets? Is that enough to offset that level of maturity? Or at some point, should we see payoffs and
kind of maturing loans in that space, eat into the growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. The payoffs already happen. I mean, that book, it's interesting. The duration of it has typically been,
historically been and for us been 36 months or less. And so you're seeing that – we're seeing that already on a
monthly basis. And so that's one of the positives about a book like that is that you work through it.
With regards to what happens in the future and the growth of that, we'll be purposeful in having a exposure to
auto and you'll see that start to peak out and what the growth is hold steady and then probably go down a little bit
over time. Which quarter that happens in is I wouldn't predict exactly what that quarter is, but it won't be a
runaway portfolio. Our goal is not to be simply known as the auto bank. We have continued to invest in
commercial. We think we have a significant opportunity. In fact, market data shows us that we're underpenetrated
in deposits in key markets for commercial. We've been working very diligently on bridging that gap. We think that
we are. And so when we look at that and we look at the loan side, we think there's opportunity in commercial.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe from a credit standpoint and how the growth in auto corresponds with
CECL accounting, the look back has been nothing so far, really, just given how new that business line is.
However, historically, consumer auto tends to have a higher level of charge-offs. I'm just wondering how you're
thinking about growth in that portfolio and how you're modeling that from a CECL standpoint? And could we
actually see a meaningful step-up once that book does start to normalize and we see charge-offs move to more or
less of a normal level there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, Timur. I'll start that and I'll flip it over to Pat. But I saw that in a note that you had talking about the higher
level of charge-off. And I wonder if we're mixing strategies. And by that, I mean this is a prime and super prime
book. We know that the charge-off rate is what through the cycle, about 35 to 45 basis points. So I consider it a
low risk book. We have about $10 billion in consumer finance on our books of prime and super prime, primarily in
real estate between home equity and residential. And we see that we're lending to very similar customers in a
balanced scorecard model.
So we've actually seen an increase in credit bureaus over the last 12 – credit bureau scores. And those scores
that we lent into this portfolio in the last month, for example, is FICO of 783. And I believe it's around 780 the
month before. And the overall book is between 760 and 770. So I don't consider this as a high-risk book at all.
17


Associated Banc-Corp

And because we're lending to people that pay us back and we're lending in a fashion that takes in multiple
variables to calculate the risk parameters, how else would you answer that, Pat?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
No, I think that's good summary. I mean, we haven't seen the maturation level yet, but the metrics in terms of
charge-offs, delinquencies, et cetera, are tracking in how we would expect it. And we've been very happy with the
deals that have gone into it and how they performed. Like Andy said, we're in that prime and super prime space.
So it's really kind of aligned with our expectations were.

Timur F. Braziler Q

Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. It's about 1,300 dealers right now. And as Derek said, we're expanding within the footprint. I would say we'll
go through the same course of our business model in terms of adding dealers where it makes sense based on
their quality and how they fit our model.

I wanted just to quickly ask you about the fees. I know you maintained the guidance, but just given this quarter's
results. When you kind of flow through the guide, it implies a bit of a step-down in the fourth quarter. And I just
wanted to know if there was anything specific driving that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
There's not. We've had pretty strong mortgage fees the last two quarters related to MSR valuations going up.
That won't continue at that level, but otherwise there's no specific guidance that would suggest a step-down from
our standpoint.

Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
In terms of the makeup of our SNC portfolio, the largest concentration of that portfolio is within both power and
utilities in our REIT business. Both of those lending verticals reflect the successful business model we've had
there for many years. Those lines of business as well as the full SNC portfolio continue to perform very well from
a credit standpoint. So we're happy with it. We view SNCs as something that we review both on the front end very
specifically to make sure it fits the business model. And we're doing – we continue to do from an underwriting and
portfolio management standpoint, we do the same from a credit standpoint with those deals as direct deals.

Understood. That's great color. Do you happen to have what portion of the loan portfolio it is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Brody, that's not something we disclose. And with regards to what we're the lead in, for me, when I think of
it, we're trying to lend into industries and customers that we understand. And with that, we see this as a fairly low
risk portfolio. From my perspective, the question I have for the team is not that would we get out of these credits
from a risk standpoint, but would we get out of these credits from a return standpoint. And so we've spent the last,
I don't know, four months looking credit by credit across all of our portfolios. And I see credits in every single –
almost every single portfolio of the bank that I believe that we could replace with the higher yielding asset.
And so as we go quarter-by-quarter, that will be, I think all, but with regards to SNCs , there's not a view that this
is a high-risk portfolio and we've not seen the emergence of that or indication of it, particularly in businesses that
we've been for an extended period of time that have those type of loans.

So I want to say we've been building that – I don't have that specific number in front of me, but we've been
building that over the last couple of quarters. Our office portfolio has continued to remain pretty stable. We have
not seen a lot of degradation there, but we do have an outsized reserve against it, just given the uncertainty in
that market.

Okay. Got it. Understood. And then, Andy, I just want to ask one last one just on the 2.0 version of the plan that
we're going to get here down the road. Are those going to have kind of like any medium or longer term profitability
targets that you're going to set out to achieve?

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Brody, what I'll say about that as I try very hard not to get in front of the board, and so we'll be meeting with
them over the course of the next 10 days to go over in detail. Once I make sure that I have proper governance, I
am very prepared. In fact, they're holding me back from sharing what we're going to do. So they're fair questions.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
They are good questions, and we intend to have something later this quarter before year end that announces
specifically what actions we intend to take. So I hate to delay it that way, but I must in this case.
