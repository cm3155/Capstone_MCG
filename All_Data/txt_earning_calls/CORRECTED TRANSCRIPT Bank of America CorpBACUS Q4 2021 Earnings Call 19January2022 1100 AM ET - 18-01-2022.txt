Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Before I turn the call over to Brian and Alastair, let me just remind you that we may make some forward-looking
statements, and refer you to the non-GAAP financial measures during the call regarding various elements of our
financial results.
Our forward-looking statements that may be made are based on management's current expectations and the
assumptions therein and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to
materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and the SEC filings that are available on
the website.
Information about the non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to those, can also be found in our
earnings materials that are available on the website.
So with that, let me turn it over to Brian. Take it away.

Brian T. Moynihan
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Lee, and good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us again. I hope all of you are
continuing to manage safely through the new variant.
First, I'd like to start this call by recognizing that Paul, our CFO for many years, has now moved on to help us with
our efforts helping our customers make a just transition to a low-carbon footprint, and I want to thank him for his
many years of service; and welcome Alastair to the call, our new CFO, who's been in that role since November 1,
and he's off to a great start. And you're going to hear from him in a minute.
So just stepping back on the cover slide, today, we reported $7 billion in after-tax net income or $0.82 per diluted
share. That's up significantly from the year-ago period. This quarter was a repeat of the themes we discussed with
you in the last few quarters. The pre-pandemic organic growth engine, that is Bank of America, is fully back in
place and producing success.
We had strong organic and responsible growth across all our businesses. We grew revenue and produced
positive operating leverage. We continue to see very strong asset quality metrics. We support our clients in their
need for capital. And we've made further progress in support of local community efforts across all our markets.
I want to congratulate, importantly, and thank our 200,000 teammates around the globe for all the great work they
did in 2021 that enable us to deliver for our clients, our team, our shareholders and our communities.
Let's go to start on slide 2 and a few comments about our full year results. This quarter capped a record year of
$32 billion in earnings for 2021 and represented significant growth in net income over 2020. We even saw a more
significant growth in EPS as share count dropped. We generated more than $7 billion of earnings in every quarter
in 2021.
Revenue grew 4% year-over-year, and activity gained momentum throughout the year. NII grew well in the
second half of the year, which complemented fee growth, especially in our markets-related businesses. Wealth
Management, investment banking and sales and trading revenues were all strong in 2021.
Pausing in NII, recall that in the first quarter 2021, we noted at the time that our expectation is that quarterly NII
could progress up by $1 billion per quarter as we entered the fourth quarter. And, in fact, we have recorded fourth
quarter NII that is $1.2 billion or 12% better than first quarter 2021.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Our teams managed well through the rate volatility, and we grew loans and deposits with our customer as the
year progressed. That sets us up nicely for 2022, and Alastair is going to talk about that in a minute.
Expense was well managed, but expense did go up as we continue to invest for growth. That's axiomatic. Our
COVID-related costs remained elevated and revenue-related costs grew. So while we did not see full year
operating leverage, we did, however, return to strong operating leverage in each of the last two quarters of the
year, restarting our streak that we had before the pandemic.
Credit remained stellar through 2021. Charge-offs consistently improved each quarter. Our commitment to
responsible growth remains well placed. We are growing faster than the market and keeping credit costs in check.
The economic improvement and our strong credit allowed us to release much of the reserves we built in 2020.
When you look at the balance sheet, we grew deposits $270 billion in 2021. That was on top of the $360 billion of
growth we had in 2020. Our loan growth accelerated throughout the year. Fourth quarter represented the
strongest quarter of organic loan growth we have experienced at Bank of America. Now, of course, that's absent
the first quarter 2020 at the start of COVID, which had $70 billion of panic drawdowns in a few weeks. At the end
of the day, we produced strong ROA and a 17% ROTCE for you, our shareholders, and we returned $32 billion in
capital during the year.
Let's go to slide 3. The best way to highlight the drivers behind the earnings success is to look at the momentum
and client activity across the businesses. This shows organic growth engine is running hard. More and more of
this client activity is powered by our digital transformation, which is foundational to everything we do. We are
proud of our digital stats and continue to spotlight our results later in the materials as usual, see pages 24 to 28.
But some key stats on this page, consumers logged into our digital channels more than 2.7 billion times in the
fourth quarter alone.
Erica, our digital financial assistant, completed more than 400 million requests from our clients in the year 2021.
Half our Consumer sales were digital in the fourth quarter. 86% of all the check deposit transactions are now
digital. Customers used Zelle to transfer $65 billion in the most recent quarter. The number of Zelle transactions
now surpasses the checks written by our consumers. CashPro approvals by our commercial and corporate clients
to move money grew 240% since the pandemic. So the digital journey continues, and that supercharges our
relationship manager-driven model. And together, that has driven the growth on loans and deposits and fees.
Net new checking accounts have grown in each of the past 12 quarters. This contributes to the continued growth
in our core deposits. This also demonstrates the extent of our leadership position with US consumers in deposits.
We have $1.4 trillion in deposits from all American consumers.
On credit cards, at roughly 1 million new accounts in the fourth quarter alone, that's now operating at the same
level of new card production as it was pre-pandemic. We're going to continue to drive that opportunity.
When you think about Consumer investments, Merrill Edge as we call it, we opened 525,000 new accounts in the
year 2021. Those accounts carried – renew at opening $70,000 in balances for each of those accounts. This
demonstrates the deep penetration of the mass affluent customer base of America.
Sales of bank products in both Merrill and our Private Bank teams have remained strong. Now, when you
combine Merrill, the Private Bank and Consumer investments, they've produced more than $170 billion in net
client flows in 2021.

In Global Banking, we had record years of investment banking fees combined with the strong GTS results. In
Global Markets, we saw record equity sales and trading revenue. These are just a few examples of the types of
client activity that are driving market share gains for our company.
As I've done in the past, I want to spend a few minutes on the broader economy, and I'll use our own customer
data to make a few points. Let's go to slide 4. First on consumer spending I'd offer a few thoughts. We are a
provider of choice for individuals and businesses when paying for goods and services. Our award-winning and
ease-of-use capabilities across all forms help clients budget, save, spend and borrow carefully and confidently.
We look at all forms of consumer spending, including ACH, wires, billpay, P2P, cash and checks.
Many firms and many people discuss credit and debit spending, but as you look at the chart on the lower left-hand
side of page 4, you can see that 80% of the money moves in other form.
So what happened in 2021? Well, consumers spent record amounts and for context I am comparing 2021 against
the pre-pandemic period of 2019, and you can see that in the upper charts on both sides of the page. Bank of
America's 67 million clients made $3.8 trillion in total payments during 2021. That was an increase of 24% over
pre-pandemic levels, an all-time high.
Fourth quarter and December payments also reached record highs. Fourth quarter payments were up 28% over
2019; and December payments were up 30% over 2019. These are the dollar volume payments. But likewise, the
numbers of payments were up double digits also, showing more and more activity.
Just focusing on debit and credit spending for the holiday period of November and December, spending was up
26% over 2019. This data confirms that consumers continue to spend into the holiday season. And so far this
year, that strength continues. For all the spending of all types through January 17, 2022, we have seen it up over
11% versus the start of 2021, which is well up over 2020 and 2019. That bodes well for the rest of the year and
quarter.
Focusing on the channels of payment in the lower right-hand chart, as you'd expect, cash and check volumes are
down 24% for 2021 compared to 2019. This simply means more and more customers are using our digital
capabilities to achieve their goals each year. Now importantly, though, this allows us to grow our Consumer
business with lower cost.
We believe there's lots of potential spending capacity left, as average deposit balances continue to move up
through the end of the year despite the heavy spending you see. We had one segment, one cohort of deposits
that dipped for one month over the last part of the year. In November, we had a small dip in customers who had
$2,000 or less in their balances pre-pandemic. They dipped by 1%. Other than that, every cohort from June, July,
August, September, October, November and December, all grew every month.
And what's striking is that the balances for people who had less than $2,000 average balances before the
pandemic, they're now sitting with five times the balances they had pre-pandemic. For those customers that had
$10,000 in accounts before the pandemic, they're now sitting with two times in their accounts. The teams track
this data carefully, and it shows the spending power left in the American consumer.
Another economic signpost worth noting through our customer activity was the acceleration of loan growth in the
fourth quarter. Earlier last year, we talked about the green shoots of loan growth we saw in the first quarter. And
we saw that turn into growth as we moved through the quarters, culminating with $50 billion in record loan growth

this quarter. We note these borrowers, both consumer and commercial, have strong capacity to continue to
borrow if they so desire as line as lines across the border and low usage status.
We provide slide 5 to show you the daily outstanding loans, again, this quarter, which gives you a sense of
progression across time. Every loan category saw improvement this quarter, except for home equity. What I
would draw your attention to on slide 5 is the addition of the pre-pandemic starting points to give you some
reference.
While some of the growth this quarter was in Global Markets, and that business ebbs and flows with the market
activity, $35 billion of that $50 billion was in the core Consumer and Commercial books. So far in January, the
businesses other than Global Markets continue to show growth over the end of the year.
So let's start and talk about the Commercial portfolio, where we have moved above the pre-pandemic level with
the most recent growth. Commercial loans, excluding PPP, grew $43 billion or 9% linked-quarter. Compared to
quarter three, growth this quarter was broad-based across all segments of commercial lending. We saw
improvement in both new loans as well as improved utilization from existing clients. This reflects the intense
relationship manager effort our teams have done across the last couple years and adding more and more
relationship managers.
Commercial loans of Wealth Management clients extended their growth trend this quarter as these customers
borrowed for various liquidity needs for asset purchases. In small business lending, the all-important small
business segment, lending activity is running consistently above pre-pandemic levels. And especially in our
Practice Solutions group that supports medical, dental and veterinary practices, we continue to see continued
momentum and finished one of the best years across all small business with our Business Advantage rewards
cards.
Turning to Consumer loans, card loans grew $4.6 billion or 6% from quarter three levels. This occurred as
spending increased and even occurred as payment rates, paying off the card, completely trended higher for the
quarter. Card balances still remain well below the pre-pandemic levels of $95 billion, and we continue to push that
opportunity. Mortgage loan levels grew 2% linked-quarter as origination remain at high levels and paydown
slowed down.
On the next, slide 6, I would say that while we delivered capital back to our shareholders, $32 billion, and we
invest in our teammates, we also continued to invest in our communities through our local teams across the
country focused on our markets.
I call out the reference in the bottom middle of slide 6 to the sweeping changes we announced last week in our
NSF policies. These updates continue the work we began over a decade ago to simplify our product set and allow
a great experience for our clients and an efficient capability for our operations.
Eliminating NSF fees and reducing the overdraft charge per occurrence from $35 to $10 and the other changes
we're making is a big win for our clients. It's going to have an obvious impact on those fees, which have fallen
dramatically since 2009 and 2010, but currently run about $1 billion in 2021. And we'd expect them to drop by
75% over the next year or so.
With that, let me turn it over to Alastair.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Alastair Borthwick
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to take us to our fourth quarter results on slide 7,
focusing on comparisons against the prior-year quarter. And I'll also talk to the high-level commentary on slide 8.
As Brian noted, we produced $7 billion in net income, which grew 28% from fourth quarter 2020, while earnings
per share of $0.82 improved at a faster, 39%, pace due to our share repurchases.
Looking at our top line improvement on a year-over-year basis, revenue rose 10%. The improvement was driven
by a $1.2 billion increase in NII and a little more than $800 million increase in noninterest income. Each business
segment produced strong noninterest income results. And as you look at significant components of revenue, it
was pretty consistent through the quarters in 2021.
One important aspect of responsible growth has been to grow consistently and sustainably. And I think we
executed on that in 2021, with investment banking over $2 billion each quarter; sales and trading near or above
$3 billion each quarter; investment and brokerage services revenue over $4 billion each quarter.
With regard to expenses, our revenue-related costs increased and we continued to make investments in our
people and our capabilities to grow the franchise. At the same time, lower COVID-19 costs and further digital
engagement have helped to offset some of those increases.
In the fourth quarter, revenue growth outpaced expense growth on a year-over-year basis, which produced
operating leverage of 400 basis points and a 19% year-over-year improvement in pre-tax pre-provision income to
$7.3 billion.
With regard to returns, our ROTCE was 15%, ROA was 88 basis points, both of which improved nicely over the
year.
Moving to slide 9, during the quarter, the balance sheet grew $85 billion to a little less than $3.2 trillion; and this
reflected the $100 billion of growth in deposits. These deposits funded $51 billion of loans growth, and we also
added $14 billion in securities and saw our cash increase by $68 billion. Partially offsetting these increases were
typical year-end moves in our Global Markets balance sheet.
Our liquidity portfolio grew to $1.2 trillion or a little more than a third of our balance sheet. And shareholders'
equity declined $2.4 billion from Q3, driven by the $8.9 billion of capital distributions, which once again outpaced
earnings in the fourth quarter as it did in Q3.
With regard to our regulatory ratios, CET1, under the standardized approach, was 10.6% and remains well above
our 9.5% minimum requirement. The CET1 ratio declined 50 basis points from Q3, driven by excess capital
reduction, as well as an increase in our RWA due to the strong loans growth.
And we're happy to see that capital usage increasingly needed to support customers and to fuel their growth while
still producing plenty of capital to return to our shareholders. Earnings alone in the most recent quarter contributed
45 basis points to our CET1 ratio before the other capital impacts of share repurchase.
Given our deposit growth, our supplemental leverage ratio declined to 5.5% versus a minimum requirement of
5%, which still leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. And our TLAC ratio remained comfortably
above our requirements.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Turning to slide 10, we included the schedule on average loan balances. But in the interest of time, I don't have
anything to add beyond what Brian noted earlier.
Moving to deposits on slide 11, we continued to see significant growth across the client base as we deepened
relationships and added net new accounts across our deposit-taking businesses. Combining both Consumer and
Wealth Management customer balances, I would highlight that retail deposits grew $48 billion from Q3. Our retail
deposits have now grown to nearly $1.4 trillion, and we lead all competitors.
We also saw continued strong growth with our Commercial clients. And remember, the deposits we're focused on
and are gathering are the operational deposits of our customers in both Consumer and wholesale.
Turning to slide 12 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q3 was $11.4 billion. But I know as
investors, you tend to focus on the FTE NII number, which was $11.5 billion. So focusing on the change on an
FTE basis, net interest income increased $1.2 billion from Q4 2020 or 11%, driven by deposit growth and related
investing of liquidity.
NII versus Q3 of 2021 was up $319 million, driven by deposit growth and then higher securities levels, as well as
loans growth. Premium amortization declined roughly $100 million to $1.3 billion in Q4, and the positive NII impact
of lower premium amortization offset lower PPP fees.
Given continued deposit growth and low rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remains significant. It's
modestly lower quarter-over-quarter as long end rates moved higher, and we recognized some of that sensitivity
in our now higher reported level of NII.
So I'd like to give you a couple thoughts on NII expectations for 2022. First, I want to start by reiterating Paul's
comment last quarter that we expect to see robust NII growth in 2022 compared to 2021. That assumes we see
continued loans growth and the rising rates expectations embedded in the forward curve.
And in the first quarter, specifically, we expect two headwinds. First, there are two less interest accrual days in the
quarter. And as a reminder, we picked those back up in the subsequent two quarters. Second, we expect less
PPP fee benefits. Combined, those two headwinds add to about $250 million.
Despite those headwinds, we would still expect Q1 to be up about couple hundred million from Q4 and should
grow nicely each subsequent quarter in 2022. Again, that's, of course, dependent upon the realization of the
forward curve and some loans growth.
Lastly, as we see the forward curve now expecting a new rate hiking cycle to begin, we added slide 13, as we
thought it might be helpful from a historical context to see the trend of NII across the years since the last rate hike
cycle. And what I want to draw your attention to is the stark difference in the size of our balance sheet today. And
because of that balance sheet differential, today's NII is already at the NII level we saw when we were well into
the middle of the last rate cycle. And importantly, our short end asset sensitivity today is twice what it was in the
third quarter of 2015 as that cycle began.
Okay. Let's turn to costs, and we'll use slide 14 for that discussion. Our Q4 expenses were $14.7 billion, an
increase of $291 million from Q3. Higher revenue-related costs and, to a lesser degree, seasonally higher
marketing costs drove the increase. As Brian noted at a mid-quarter conference, our Q4 expenses were a bit
higher than we anticipated when we ended the last quarter.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Revenue continue to hold up well and the company had a good year, both resulting then in higher incentive costs.
Compared to the year-ago period, expense growth was driven by incentive costs associated with all of our
markets-related improvements.
As we look forward, we continue to invest in technology and people at a high rate across our businesses and we
continue to add new financial centers in expansion and growth markets.
So let me say two things about 2022 expenses. First, relative to Q4 expense, we expect Q1 to include two
elements of seasonality. We typically experience seasonally higher payroll tax expense, and that was about $400
million in 2021. Also, Q1 is typically our best period of sales and trading revenue, which results in modestly higher
associated costs.
Second, with regard to full year 2022, our best expectation currently is we can hold expenses flat compared to
2021 which finished just below $60 billion. This guidance incorporates our expected continuing investments,
strong revenue performance and the inflationary costs we experienced in the second half of 2021. It also relies
upon our continued expense discipline, operational excellence improvements and the benefits of digital
transformation to deliver the operating leverage we seek.
Turning to asset quality on slide 15. The asset quality of our customers remains very healthy, and net charge-offs
this quarter fell to a historical low of $362 million or 15 basis points of average loans. They continued a steady
decline through the quarters of 2021, with Q4 down $100 million from Q3 and down more than $500 million from
Q4 last year.
Our credit card loss rate was 1.42%, and that's less than half of the pre-pandemic rate. It improved each quarter
during the year. Several other loan product categories have been in recovery positions throughout the year.
Provision was a $489 million net benefit in Q4, driven primarily by asset quality and macroeconomic improvement
and was partially offset by loans growth. This included a reserve release of $850 million, primarily in our
Commercial portfolio.
And on slide 16 we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios.
Turning to the business segments, let's start with Consumer Banking on slide 17. I'll start by acknowledging what
a strong year the consumer bank has had as they generated nearly $12 billion of earnings, which is 37% of record
year results for the company.
Consumer opened over 900,000 net new checking accounts and, in fact, this quarter represents their 12th
consecutive quarter of net new Consumer checking account growth. And in turn, Consumer grew deposits by
more than $140 billion.
They opened 3.6 million credit cards and grew card accounts in 2021 by more than any of the past four years.
This helped card balances grow in Q4 despite payments remaining high.
They also opened 525,000 new Consumer investment accounts, and that helped us to reach a new record for
investment balances of $369 billion, growing 20% year-over-year, as customers continue to recognize the value
of our online offering. Yes, market valuations grew balances and we also saw $23 billion of client flows since Q4
2020.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
So Q4 was a strong finish to these results. And in the quarter, the business produced $3.1 billion of earnings, of
$8.9 billion of revenue, and managed costs well. Our 8% revenue growth was led by NII improvement as we
continued to recognize more of the value of our deposit book.
And while revenue grew, expense declined by 1% year-over-year, generating over 900 basis points of operating
leverage. Lower COVID costs and increased digital adoption by clients more than offset our continued
investments in people and our franchise. This expense discipline has now driven our cost of deposits to an
industry-leading 111 basis points.
Net charge-offs declined, and we had $380 million of reserve release in the quarter. And as you can see and as I
already noted, deposits continued to grow strongly both year-over-year as well as linked-quarter. Importantly, our
rate paid remained low and stable.
Turning to the Wealth Management business, Bank of America continued to deliver Wealth Management at scale
across a full range of client segments. The continued economic progress, strong market conditions and the efforts
of our advisors contributed to strong client flows and net new household growth. This allowed Wealth
Management to generate more than $4 billion in earnings in 2021, up more than 40% from 2020.
In Q4, this powerful combination of Merrill Lynch and our Private Bank produced records for revenue, earnings,
investment balances and asset management fees, as well as record levels of loans and deposits. In fact, with
regard to loans, this is the 47th consecutive quarter of average loans growth in the business. It's consistent and
it's sustained.
Q4 net income was $1.2 billion, improving 47% year-over-year and driven by strong revenue growth, good
expense controls, and lower credit costs. Revenue growth of 16% was led by strong improvements in both AUM
and brokerage fees, as well as higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases.
Expenses increased 8%, in alignment with the higher revenue, and resulted in 800 basis points of operating
leverage. Client balances of $3.8 trillion rose $491 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by higher market levels,
as well as very strong net client flows of $149 billion.
Within these flows, deposits grew $68 billion year-over-year to $390 billion, and loans grew $21 billion year-over-
year to $212 billion. And that loan and deposit growth is further evidence that more and more Merrill and Private
Bank clients are using the bank's products broadly.
Net new household generation is getting closer to pre-pandemic levels as advisors are meeting in person more
with clients and are building their pipelines back, following the shut down during the pandemic. This quarter,
Merrill Lynch net new households of 6,700 and Private Banking relationships net new of 500 were both up more
than 30% from the year-ago period.
The clients of this business continue to lead our franchise in digital adoption, utilizing digital tools to access their
investments and also for other banking needs like mobile check deposits and lending. The evolution is forming a
modern Merrill, which is advisor-led and powered by digital.
Moving to Global Banking on slide 19. The business momentum through the back half of the year was strong. Net
interest income grew on the back of accelerating loans growth. Investment banking fees reached record levels
and deposits continued to grow as clients navigated the pandemic.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
We also straw strong demand from our clients around ESG investments, driving improvements in bottom line
results. Net income for the full year was a record $9.8 billion or 31% of the company's overall net income. The
business earned $2.7 billion in Q4, improving nearly $1 billion year-over-year, driven by higher revenue and lower
provision costs, partially offset by higher expenses.
Revenue improvement of 24% year-over-year reflected more than 30% growth in investment banking fees in this
segment, and net interest income increased 18%. This investment banking performance allowed us to gain
market share and record number three ranking in overall fees in what was a very strong Q4 market.
We ranked number one in investment-grade and number two in leverage finance with market share improvement
compared to the year-ago period. And we also saw another record M&A period. And most importantly, our
investment banking pipeline remains quite healthy.
Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $435 million, compared to a $266 million release in the year-ago
period. And what I'd draw your attention to here is the reduction in net charge-offs year-over-year from $314
million in Q4 of 2020 to small recoveries in Q4 2021. That year-ago period included some losses from clients and
those industries that were heavily impacted by COVID.
Finally, given the strength of revenue, we saw expenses increase by 12%, which was still only half of our increase
in revenue.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 20, full year net income of $4.6 billion reflects another solid year of sales and
trading revenue. This included a record year for equities, up 19% versus 2020. Investments made in this part of
the business are seeing good results as our financing clients are doing more business with our company. As we
usually do, I'll talk about the segment results, excluding DVA, even though net DVA was negligible in both Q4
2021 and Q4 2020.
In Q4, Global Markets produced $667 million in earnings, $167 million lower than the year-ago quarter. Focusing
on year-over-year, revenue was modestly down, driven by sales and trading. Sales and trading contributed $2.9
billion to revenue, a decline of 4% year-over-year, FICC down 10%, while equities improved 3%. FICC results
reflect a weaker credit-trading environment in Q4 2020. And the strength in equities was driven by growth in client
financing activities and the multiplier effect.
The year-over-year expense move was driven by investments and revenue-related sales and trading costs,
partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the realignment of a liquidating business activity to the All
Other units in Q4.
Finally, on slide 21, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $673 million, which declined a little more than
$250 million from the year-ago period. Revenue declined as a result of higher volume of deals, particularly solar,
and partnership losses on ESG investments. That's offset by the tax impact in this reporting unit.
Expense increased as a result of costs now recorded here after the fourth quarter realignment out of Global
Markets, which was partially offset by decrease in various other expenses in the segment. That realignment,
obviously, had no bottom line impact on our company overall.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
As a reminder, for the financial statement presentation in this release, the business segments are all taxed on the
standard fully taxable-equivalent basis. And in All Other, we incorporate the impact of our ESG tax credits and
any other unusual items.
For the full year, the effective tax rate was 6%. And excluding the second quarter 2021 positive tax adjustment
triggered by the UK tax law change and other discrete items, the tax rate would have been 14%. Further adjusting
for ESG tax credits, our tax rate would have been 25%. And looking forward, we would expect our effective tax
rate in 2022 to be between 10% and 12%, absent any tax law changes or unusual items.
And with that, I think I'll stop and we'll open it up for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. Thank you. I'll try to ask this as easy as possible. But in the wave of a couple of other companies in the
space talking a lot about comp inflation and stepped-up investments, I think a lot of shareholders would love to
see and hear your comments about, all else equal, flattish expenses in 2022.
And so, the simple enough question is how do people take comfort to know that you're making all the right
investments to continue to compete and take share and migrate digitally like you have been doing, but we're
seeing so much competition across all your business lines. So just looking for some warm fuzzy blanket words of
encouragement. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I'll just start, Glenn, by reiterating what you just said. You said we're taking market share. So I'd say we've
sustained our technology investments all the way through the pandemic. We've sustained our financial center
renovations. We've sustained our marketing. We've sustained our investment and relationship managers. And the
result of that is, in many cases, record client experience.
And you can see, I think, in our numbers that we are doing more business with our existing clients. We're adding
net new clients and we're growing market share, and we're getting third-party recognition as well. So I think its
results is how you will judge us on the technology, but we're obviously very competitive in that regard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, Glenn, let me just throw a couple of things. One, obviously, it's axiomatic that revenue from markets-related
business, whether it's in Wealth Management or investment banking teammates, or it's in the markets business.
So Jimmy DeMare and Matthew Koder and Andy and Katie have done great jobs, and that's a given. They're
going to go up, and you see that. Those numbers are up dramatically over the last couple years as markets have
raised. But you invest a lot of ways.

So we'll never have the temerity to say that we know every possible competitive thing that could happen over the
next decade in this company. But if you look across history, which is what Alastair is referring to, we've invested in
new technology development $3 billion to $3.5 billion year after year after year. And we tend to invest in things
that work and then drive them and scale them. And so, you see that if you look at pages 24, 25, 26, 27 and just
start to think about what we said earlier.
Zelle is more transaction count than checks written. Think about that change. Think about the change in the
branches that basically in our expense guidance, we'll open 100 new branches this year on top of the 200 and
some we've opened in the last three years. But importantly, we shifted from other places, in that we brought
branch count overall down as we've been doing that. That means we're opening up new markets, gaining market
share, as Alastair said, and using the expense base in others.
And then in our broad-based teammates, we basically have gone to $21 an hour. Our attrition rates are similar to
where they were in 2019, which was a 10-year low. So think about we've invested heavily, we've invested broad-
based, but you're seeing the activities going. And if you start to think about the retail deposits per branch, there
are multiples of other people. So you think about the – we have 4,100 branches. We have $1 trillion in consumer
deposits and $400 billion in Wealth Management deposits. So that operating leverage is what we do.
So we're an operating leverage company. We're not a cost takeout company anymore, we haven't been. But we
see the path forward of flat expenses next year. And, frankly, there was a lot of one-time stuff that went through
the last couple years that is coming to an end. And that we'll reposition that to help pay for the types of things,
revenue-related growth and investments that we think are important. But just look at those stats and see what
we've done, and I think that that's where we get the confidence.

Glenn Schorr Q

Well said. All right. I'll leave it at that. Thanks very much.

Operator: The next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Morning. Alastair, I was wondering if you could unpack the outlook for robust net interest income growth in 2022.
Kind of wondering what kind of loan growth assumptions are you building in for the year? And how do liquidity
deployment and premium amortization assumptions also factor in to your outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Okay. So let's start with loans growth. We're pretty optimistic on loans growth. You can see on slide 5 just the
consistency. That's daily. You can see the consistency of the growth. It's broad-based across all the businesses,
as Brian noted, and obviously it's accelerated recently.
The thing I find interesting about slide 5 is you've really got to adjust for the size of the economy today relative to
where our loans were in 2019, pre-pandemic. So we know there's some potential for catch up there. And we can
see that in our data too, John. Our revolver utilization rates are still lower than historic levels. So we feel like
there's some potential there. And in things like card, payment rates are still elevated.

So there's a variety of things there that make us feel good about loans growth. Certainly, more bullish than we
might have been in a pre-pandemic GDP type 2% to 3% kind of environment. So we're pretty optimistic on loans. I
think you need to think about that in sort of high-single digits.
And then, when it comes to – you can see when we put forth our asset sensitivity numbers, that $6.5 billion for a
parallel shock is meant to give you an idea of how we believe we're levered to rates. I'd say about 75% of that is
probably the short end, probably 25% is the long end with things like premium amortization. And that's probably
how I'd break it down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And then, as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about how you're managing to your capital minimums.
What kind of cushion do you want to keep to the SLR? Just remind us the target on CET1. And how do buybacks,
which it seems like you've accelerated in the back half of 2021, how does that factor into the overall calculation of
managing growth and capital? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Sure, John. If you go back, John, for many years, in our discussions, we've had excess capital despite the many
ways that the capital process increased the capital requirements for large companies like ours, including the
introduction of the G-SIFI buffer, et cetera, et cetera, and then the stress testing and SLR, et cetera.
So we've always said we'd maintain 50 basis points to 100 basis points of cushion. We're now getting closer to
that. But the reality is that we are seeing the kind of organic growth that is what you want us to see, investing in
the client franchise, whether it's in the markets business of having 20%, 25% more balance sheet deployed and
seeing that pick up and having a record amount of revenues, whether it's the deposit growth that we're now at $2
trillion of deposits and $1 trillion in loans, and it is growing well.
So expect us to have a different equation, which is we'll still pay out dividends up to 30%, like we said. We used to
say the other 70% would come back to you. Now, there would be some for organic growth if, in fact, we get down
to the 10.5% levels, and the rest will be repurchased on a quarterly basis. But at an earnings rate of $7 billion,
there's a lot of capital deployment even embedded in that.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I guess, first Brian and then Alastair. You talk about the benefit of higher rates. But I think for you and the
industry, it's the benefit of better relationships, to the extent that relationships are sticky as rates increase. So if
you can just give some metrics around retention. And then specifically, last year, you gave an NII guide of $1
billion higher. Can you give us some sense where you expect NII to be from 4Q 2021 to 4Q 2022? Thanks.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think on your very last point, Alastair gave you the starting point and gave you robust – strong enough we'll –
because it'll depend a little bit on the path forward. We're $6.5 billion of rate sensitivity, a 100-basis-point increase
as we said. So we'll let you figure out when those rate changes come through.
Backing up to your broader point, Mike, at the end of the day, in the Consumer business, what drives our
capabilities there is the preferred group of customers that are 80%-plus of the balances, and retention rate
through Preferred Rewards, and the millions of people we have in it is 99%-plus. And those customers have
tremendous relationship with us. And we invest across, whether it's the – Preferred Rewards, as you know, go
across the whole business and not just by-product. So those customers get rewards in credit cards that they pay
for by giving us deposits.
You go to Wealth Management, if you look at the stats, you can see the strong growth, not only in what you'd
expect in the AUM side, but the client flows in deposits and other products as we continue to drive the core deep
relationship across in the Private Bank, but importantly in Merrill, across all different segments. And even as we
enter new markets where we didn't have banking capabilities, Columbus, Ohio, for example, there was robust
Merrill capability as we're building underneath.
So that relationship – and if you move to the Commercial side, it's the same thing. So our deposits in Commercial
are strong. They are all operating deposits, it's a lion's share of them. They are part of what we at core do, but
they build off the backs of that great relationship management practice and the GTS capabilities of which we've
invested billions of dollars and across last things.
And what seals that all together is not that these are [indiscernible] (00:48:15) group of enterprises that go off and
operate. It is the common things that they have together, which are things like the digital capabilities which would
give you the capabilities. That backbone goes across all our customer sets, and that enables us to drive it; and
also how they work together in the markets.
We will set a record. In 2021, we ended up getting back to where we were in referrals from one business to the
other in every market, and those are important ways that we cement a relationship. Our Commercial Banking
Investments group, as we call it, has millions of customers through our corporate relationships that have priority
access.
So it is about how you build the franchise and concentrating on eight lines of business and how they work
together. Our merchant sales are back way over where they were when we had the joint venture. Our 401(k)
engagements are way up. And again, that's going through the franchise. So we feel good about the relationship
side and if that's your point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Well, Brian, assuming you get $6.5 billion of benefits, aren't you tempted to take some of that and spend more,
because it seems like you're letting that fall to the bottom line? What are your considerations when you say we'll
let that fall to the bottom line instead of making additional investments? And also, what do you think about
expenses, say, in 2023?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I think, we're flat next year. Mike, if you remember, back, leading in the pandemic, we had, I think, 20
quarters of operating leverage in a row. But we're starting to make the turn from expenses going down and then
flattening that we're going to have to start growing, again, to allow for the rate of investments and compensating
our teammates well, et cetera. And so, we feel that that rate of investment is embedded in the run rate.
And would we start to grow expenses at some point? I think that will be based on really some of the market-
related revenue and incentives that drive it. But we still have a lot of room to go on a day-to-day basis and cost
take-out in this company, and then reinvesting that in OpEx and stuff. It is...
Think about that check, two years, 24% less checks going through the system. That's by driving those capabilities
allows us to be more efficient. So it'll go to the bottom line because, frankly, most of that value comes off the
Consumer franchise, which has been investing heavily in, whether it's Merrill Edge, whether it's the card business,
whether it's the rewards, which are a huge investment in our client base; meaning that as charges go up and the
revenue doesn't go up as much, that's actually investment. And whether it's the branches – and the new
branches, new markets, and then – but Dean and the team have been experts at repositioning the expense base
for more efficient execution.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So do we start counting again the number of quarters in a row that your achieve positive outcome? You're at two.
Are you trying to break that 20-quarter record or...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, we're at two. So we've got some room to go. So we're working on it, Mike. And we'll keep plugging away.
But you know us. We know how to manage expenses in this company. I wouldn't be here if we didn't think we
could do it the right way and invest.
So I think people should be confident that – we count heads. We're down 4,000 people in the quarter and the
year, from 212 to 208. And all those people are going to make more money because they've had a fabulous year.
But the reality is we keep managing the overall human count down, which is our biggest cost.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Hey. Good morning. Maybe a question on credit. I think we're all sort of ignoring that now, but you've seen your
all-time low net charge-offs, particularly in the card business. I think the consensus is that we'll see a
normalization process in the back half of this year and into to 2023. But we're not seeing any change really in
delinquencies. Are you in that camp that we're going to see normalization? What are the drivers of that? Or is
there some sort of behavior mix change among customers that maybe we can be a little bit more optimistic on
charge-offs over the next 18 months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, Jim, we're seeing the same thing you are. So when we're looking at our 30 days past or 60 days past or 90
days past, they're staying at those same low levels you talked about. When Brian talked about customer balances
being elevated, in some cases up five times where they were pre-pandemic, that's probably what's accounting for
a lot of the consumer credit quality improvement.
We're anticipating at some point it will go back towards more normal historical levels. We just think it's going to
bump around here for a little while. So we don't have a particular timeline on that at this point, but I'm not sure
we'd be betting on behavioral change.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities
Okay. Thanks for that. And then, just as a follow-up on the Wealth Management business. There's nice
acceleration in new households and deposit growth and net flows. But even as FA head count kind of trickles
down, I guess, how are you improving productivity there? And do you see a time where you start to see net FA
head count grow to kind of accelerate that growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. Jim, if you look at the quarter-by-quarter progression on that in the supplement or something, you could
see it's starting to flatten out. A lot of that adjustment in the recent past has been due to the work that Dean and
Andy did with Aron Levine and others on their combined training program. So we're training. We had two training
programs running, et cetera. We combined all that. And so, that now has sort of stabilized. And so, you'd expect
us to see slow growth out.
For the Merrill Edge customer, it's largely a digital execution. And that's where the real growth comes from and
that's sort of infinitely leverageable. That balance is there, $300 billion-plus, 500,000 new customers, growing
well. And for Merrill and the Private Bank, it is people, and you'll see that flatten out come up. But that had largely
to do with the repositioning of the training program that the team has accomplished. And so, now, we train one set
of advisors. They have different career paths in our company, but it makes us more efficient going to the ability to
keep managing expenses.
And so, you're seeing good household formation. The marginal productivity of our advisors is through the roof,
and you can see that. But the reality is you want to have the growth and flows, and that $170 billion for the year is
a pretty substantial increase over any year past. I think it's either twice or almost three times. So we feel good
about it. And a year when, remember, you still could meet face-to-face with your clients a lot. It's not the easiest
year to develop business, too. So the team did a great job.

Operator: We'll go now to Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yes, hi. I just wanted to ask Alastair a follow-up question on NII. In that $6.5 billion number, what kind of deposit
re-pricing is embedded in your sensitivity? And as you look at potential actual performance for the year, as
opposed to the sensitivity, how should we expect total deposits to trend in terms of growth or attrition and also re-
pricing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Okay. So, obviously, it feels like right now we're at the beginning of a new rate hike cycle. And so, we're looking
back towards 2015 to 2019 as the most recent rate hike cycle. During that period, Erica, we had deposit base of
probably between 20% and 25%, somewhere in the middle of that. We'd like to think, this time around, it'll be
something similar, hopefully a little bit better based on what we've learned and based on the value we add to our
customers.
And then, in terms of deposit growth, we have deposit growth moderating back towards more normal growth over
time, just recognizing we're coming off of two years of extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Just to confirm, given the deposit growth that you're seeing, you mentioned that most of your growth is
concentrated in operating accounts. You don't expect declines in deposits as rates rise?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
We didn't see it last time. From 2017 to 2019, we saw – or we've continued to grow deposits better than the
industry, and they grew throughout that period of time. And so, because of the nature of what they are, we get the
economists to go through all the drawing of the things and because of some of the off-balance sheet financing
that Fed has put together. But this is a strict matter. Last time, we did not see deposits go down as the Fed's
balance sheet shrank by from $8 trillion or whatever the peak was down to around $4 trillion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And just taking a step back, this question is for Brian. Brian, one of your closest peers, JPMorgan, sort of
gave a medium-term ROTCE target of about 17%. And as you think about BofA over the next few years and you
think about normalizing rates, your comment about self-funding the investments, a much bigger balance sheet, I
don't think we've seen high-single digits growth in quite some time. As we put all of that together, what will you tell
your investors what your ROTCE medium-term target would be in a normalized rate environment?

Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
We've always said that our job is to keep that well in excess of our cost of capital, and we've done it. And I think,
again, because of the leverage and rate increases' instantaneous impact to business like the Consumer business,
which doesn't need any more capital to grow, we feel good about it. But we have focused people on that will
continue to grow the earnings at returns that are, we used to say 10% to 12%, now I'd say 15%, and we'll
continue to do that. But we need to balance the broad nominal returns of the growth. And last year, we had good
ROTCE and we expect to maintain that.

Operator: The next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. You made some significant announcements on overdraft, NSF, and I think you framed the drop versus 2010, if
I remember correctly. I guess, how much would we be modelling if that goes down in the next couple of years,
say, versus the 2021 level? And then also remind us what else is in service charges. I think you have a bunch of
commercial fees and there's always some confusion that comes of what that is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So let's start with NSFOD. What Brian's outlined is we think there's about $1 billion in there, coming down over
time, probably around 75% of that this year, just to give you some idea. Obviously, we're making those changes
as we update systems and processes, et cetera. So that's some in February, some in May. I think Lee and his
team can help you with timing, but that gives you a ballpark to try to think about that.
And then, you just asked me the service charges, just explain that one more time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. I think a lot of investors look at service charges and think it's all consumer. But I think there's a lot of
commercial fees in there, too. And just what exactly are those and remind us like how those react as interest rates
go up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So those are the GTS fees, so global transaction services. So people can pay us cash, fees, or they can
pay us with balances at which we get the earnings rate and we give them a credit as you well know. So generally
when rates go up, the dollar value of the earnings credit goes up and, therefore, people shift a little bit to that.
So Lee could take you through some of the dynamics. But yes, there'll be pressure on that fee line, but we'll be
earning money a different way. Believe me, all in, you make a lot of money and it's different for largest companies

versus small businesses and things like that. So it's a complex thing and it also comes back to the deposit betas
in the Commercial business that Alastair referenced earlier.
Also in that fee line is monthly maintenance fees for accounts on both the commercial, small business and
consumer side. There's other things in there, but the NSF is the one that in OD we wanted to focus on, which we
gave you about $1 billion and change and it's down 75%. Other than that, it ought to bounce around and kind of
go up or down a little bit, but I wouldn't be too overly worried about the other pieces.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick clarification question. Alastair, you mentioned about high-single digit
loan growth in 2022. Was that on a full year kind of average basis or period end? Or how would you frame that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. I'd say that's kind of a full year kind of a growth rate average. And I would just say it's early in the year, but I
guess what we're trying to impress upon you is we're pretty optimistic based on everything we've seen.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on the rate sensitivity and the NII outlook. Obviously, what
you gave us in the $6.5 billion is the banking book. Can you help us just understand the rest of the balance sheet,
the institutional part that's, I think, historically more liability sensitive? What's the best way of us trying to
understand like how that nets out in terms of the true underlying benefit from rates as we move higher overall for
the balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So we'd say our markets business, generally speaking, is pretty liability sensitive. So the short end will
have a modest impact negatively on us. And then, it's – liability, it works in our favor on the long end. So obviously
when we're carrying things short, longer assets, we end up making some money there. So it's probably a few
hundred million negative at the short end over a 12-month period. It's probably a couple hundred million positive
at the long end over a 12-month period, but that's ballpark how to think about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q

So it's really not a meaningful net down impact then?

No, not compared to our asset sensitivity. Part of the franchise is liability price and sensitive deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Yeah, okay. And on that second point about the deposits growth is just outstanding, and you mentioned
earlier that it's good to see the good stuff growing. But you are getting tighter on your SLR and your CET1 versus
your targets. So as you go forward, would you consider issuing more prefs to keep that buffer free? Or is it more
that you just let the balance sheet grow and take the RWAs at the trade-off of a lower buyback?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So I'll talk about the SLR. I think Brian talked about CET and buyback earlier. But obviously with SLR, we've got a
couple of different levers there. One is prefs. As you saw in fourth quarter, we issued $1.3 billion in pref, which
obviously gets some more balance sheet flexibility where we need it and when we need it. And, look, I'd just say
when we have customers coming in here about to establish a relationship with us for the course of the next 50
years, or in the case of commercial clients for the next decades, we're going to make sure that we're in a position
to take their deposits and establish that relationship for the long-term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. That's exactly why I asked. Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Alastair, a question just as we think about securities reinvestment in this rising rate environment, should we think
about you trying to keep pace with where the yields are today and shortening the duration of the book which
reduces potential AOCI risk? Or should we anticipate that you would be more likely to keep duration where it is
and benefit from a yield pickup as rates rise?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So I'd say with respect to our securities reinvestment, right now, we're finding that we've got the kind of loans
growth that we want to see, generally speaking. It's obviously we'd come off a period where we didn't see that
loans growth. So with the excess liquidity, we were in a position where were looking primarily and first add
securities. Now, we're moving more towards loans.

So if you looked at this last quarter, we added $51 billion of loans. We added $14 billion in securities. Now, we're
obviously going to be careful with respect to the OCI impact. And when you look at our balance sheet, you'll see
most of the securities in available-for-sale are treasury swap to floating. So that's going to have obviously a pretty
substantial offsetting effect to anything that happens with higher rates.
And then, I'm not sure we're going to necessarily change our duration profile around the securities portfolio. I
believe a lot of that rolling off every quarter, and then we tend to just put more back in the stack over time. So with
any luck, we'll continue to see the loans growth. That'll be our primary focus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. No, that's great. Very helpful. Thank you. And then, Brian, I know we talked a lot about reinvestment in the
franchise and the platform. I wanted to ask that question from a slightly different angle. Obviously, we're all very
well aware of FinTech competition and what's going on, technologically speaking, that enables, not only
competitors in the banking space, but non-banking space to be more active in finance.
When you think about your current platform, is it at the end state that you want? Or is there more to do with
regard to leveraging cloud and AI to enhance the efficiency of the organization overall? Or maybe that's not even
a potential outcome of shifting the technology. Maybe there's something else I'm not thinking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think AI's different than cloud. Our internal clouds, what we do with external, has largely to do with cost,
flexibility, security, what applications that we're running and how do we do that. But security and the ability to
integrate it and the ability to be never down on things like that are high on our minds. Put that aside.
The ability to continue to improve our platform is infinite. And you see it. I mean you could've asked me this
question two quarters ago and you would've had, if you look at the pages in 24 to 27, look at the statistics from
two quarters ago. And what drives these changes is things like Erica going from 17 million users to 24 million
users and 30 million interactions to 120 million fourth quarter last year to fourth quarter this year is because of the
feature functionality and capabilities of it go up. Our Life Plan's 7 million people, I think, are using them. They
have 20%, 25% more balances because of what they're doing. So we'll never be at end state, and that's where
we're continuing to drive investment.
Digital sales capabilities, we're only starting to be able to take full advantage of it, frankly, across the platform
because you had to get end to end, you had to get it all knocked together. And it's kind of interesting because it's
growing quickly now. So small business capabilities to whole merchant services. We finally got our new platform
out at a cost of $300 million. It's now being sold. Those are major investments.
So the question is do we appeal? And we open twice the population rate for people between the ages of 18 and
24 in terms of new accounts. We seem to be gaining share in that segment, and the usage by that segment is
high. And so, we feel very good that our platforms, obviously, appeal to every cohort of age and experience. And
that's what we're driving at. And then, look at Merrill Edge; 500,000 new accounts, $70,000 average balance.
Those are deep clients with real money put into work.
And so, are we satisfied? We can look at all the awards and the growth and feel spectacularly good about it. But
you can be satisfied that way, but that would be dangerous. So we continue to invest and see the numbers of

patents we get. We see everything. We will continue to invest heavily in this platform and what it takes us to is still
ahead of us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And when you think about where you are leveraging the technology in the Consumer and Wealth versus
maybe the high net worth piece of your business versus the institutional piece, do you feel like you're running a
pace at each of those? Or is there significantly more to do in one of the sleeves?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
The investment in the commercial cash management side is as we continue to drive global business continues to
be high. And I'd say Faiz Ahmad and the team there continue to challenge themselves to how much more we
could do. We've invested in merchants, now we've got to sell it. And Mark, Monica and the team are driving that.
So I think there's a different – again, this is a group of businesses that have commonalities and differences. And
the investment in markets, technologies and stuff is critically important. But we've built the data capabilities, I
think, all cohorts over the years at $1.5 billion cost that enables us to build on that platform for risk and finance
and markets. And then, now, we're continuing to enhance that.
So I'd say each one is a different story. But all will be better and all – we're investing heavily. And we make
choices about – the biggest constraint is doability. How much stuff can you get done? It's not the money. It's really
a question – you got to make sure you do it right and don't screw it up, and that it's going to really stick to the ribs
when you start driving it.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey. Good afternoon. So wanted to start off with just a clarifying question on some of the ESG investments. I
know you provided the guidance on the tax rate of 10% to 12%, which includes that benefit from those
investments. Versus 2021, is there any incremental drag to other income that we should be thinking about as the
pace of those investments steadily builds?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, Steven, I think we're continuing to do more with our clients in terms of the ESG side. So I think when
you're modelling, I'd use, say, $400 million to $500 million for Q1 to Q3, and then I'd use just a few hundred
million higher for Q4.

Great. And just a question on – a follow-up on capital. I was hoping you could just provide some early insights,
your perspective into how you're handicapping the impact of Basel IV adoption in the US? And how you think
you're positioned relative to peers, given lots of significant changes to the regime, some positive, but also quite a
few negative?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Like any other regulatory change, when it comes, we'll deal with it. But these things have impacts that are, like
you said, plus and minus, and life will go on. It may cause us to have to adjust a little here and there, but we'd still
have optimization ahead of us in the balance sheet that we can continue to work.
But when a set of rules get developed and put in front of us and become final, we'll implement them. But my
guess is it won't be anything that we – it won't be as dramatic as going from $60 billion of required capital to $175
billion of tangible common equity over the last decade, believe me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Fair enough. And if I could just squeeze in one more follow-up. Just a clarifying question on the NII guidance. Just
to help with benchmarking versus peers, they've all guided on 2022 NII based on the forward curve. I was hoping
you could provide just more explicit guidance for full year 2022 NII if, in fact, the forward curve materializes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, look, one of the reasons we don't provide full year is because we don't control what the Fed does in
terms of number of hikes, nor the size of each, nor the timing. And those things we can control like expenses,
we're quite comfortable with. So I think beyond any guidance we've given today, Steven, I would just follow up
with Lee probably.

Good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Brian, can you share with us your thoughts. You guys have committed to, I think is it $1.5 trillion in sustainable
finance commitments out to 2030. And I'm not asking so much on the climate change and that type of risk. I think
we all understand that. But can you share with us what the financial risk is? When you think about your credit card
receivable delinquencies, obviously, if the unemployment rate was to double or triple, those delinquencies
obviously would go up.
So we could kind of measure where we think delinquencies could go based on economic activity. But what should
we be looking at when it comes to sustainable finance, just some of the risks that we should be aware of out
there? Again, not the climate part. I'm thinking more the financial part.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, at the end of the day, these are companies and projects that have to be underwritten. And so, some of them
don't go well. So some of the renewable things don't work the way people want them to. So it's a good – and you
got Bruce Thompson and the team in Credit and Geoff Greener and the team in Risk. I think our track record of
underwriting credit's strong.
And so, there's a business plan, and our investments are to help our clients make the transition. We already
invest $80 billion to $100 billion, and this is a step up from that as we move forward. And 2021 was a step up. So
it's not some we got to go out and do things we haven't been doing. We have to just do more of what we've been
doing. Each individual deal is underwritten.
So what's the risk? The risk on the renewable side doesn't work, and the risk on the other side is the value of
assets comes down because the cash flows start to get impaired by regulation, customer change and things like
that. And so, as we go forward, that additional consideration of the business plan of a heavily emitting industry will
be will its business model sustain and the change in customer behavior and use of things? In the near term,
demand for all energy is going up, and the challenge for society is how we meet the needs to have a just
transition occur for everyone while changing the emission structure.
But over time, business plans of both the emitter side and the renewable side will come cleaner based on
customer behavior, people like ourselves reducing our demand for energy, it impacts our power companies and
how they supply and our demand of our power companies to do more renewables. That's going to reverberate
through our 30,000 middle market clients and our millions of small businesses piece by piece by piece.
So I don't know if that's entirely where you're going, Gerard. But it's going to come down to good core
underwriting, given the circumstances of the individual company, its business and its plans, and what its transition
plans are and the disclosure they make to us in the underwriting process. But we've done a great job in
commercial underwriting, you'd have to agree with that, over the decades. So I think we'll adjust to each deal and
each quarter, each deal and each company and each portfolio as we move along.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
No, no. That is helpful. Thank you. And you have done a good job with the underwriting. Absolutely. The follow-up
question, Brian. You've expanded into some new markets. I think you mentioned them on the call today. Maybe
Columbus, Ohio, if I recall, was a relatively new market and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Are there other markets that
you intend to expand into like you've done in those two markets? Or are you all set? You're satisfied with the
expansion physically into new areas of the country?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So a couple things. One, so why are we expanding in these markets? This is a prioritization. We first
looked at the largest markets that we weren't and said why aren't we there, because we're a nationwide brand
and capabilities. And by the way, in a lot of those markets, we had Wealth Management clients.
So we started in 2014. It's been a long effort. So we did Denver, starting in 2014, and then Minneapolis,
Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, South Lake, Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland and now Lexington. So there's a list of
other markets that we continue to go down, largely starting. Originally, the key was to close the top 30 markets,
which we were in seven if I remember right, Gerard, at the time. And we're now in all of those.
So there is really – think of the next several years as being going down to the top 50 markets which starts to cover
the substantial part of the population where you aren't. But also, even within those markets, take Grand Rapids,
Michigan, we're not at the level we want to be there. And by the way, in a place like Columbus, we're now number
five in the market. We grew at 9%. We only have 12 financial centers. The end state will be another 8, 10 type of
number.
And so, we're still building out in these markets, and it's working. And it works because of the way we do it. So
that'll all be moved, but expect us to keep working down by population markets. But think about two dimensions.
One is more markets and the second is also making sure every market – what we do is we look at like markets
and compare them into same size, capabilities. And we expect every market will get to the 75th percentile of Bank
of America business comparative.
So why is that? So that means like even in Los Angeles, we're 4% or 5% Wealth Management share, if I
remember right, versus D.C., where we have equal representation in Consumer. D.C., we're 15%, 20% market
share in Wealth Management. That means we should be 15% in LA. That's a heck of a lot of work that Danny and
Katie and team have to do.
So we look at this that way in terms of trying to drive our market share by market. And sometimes it's people,
sometimes it's branches, sometimes it's advertising, sometimes it's charitable work, sometimes community work,
or all of the above. But think of us as trying to closeout most of the US population centers over the next several
years.

Okay. I think that's all our questions, operator. So let me just close by saying, as I said earlier, the number one
point to remember is the organic growth engine that we had before the pandemic is fully back in gear and driving.
We've had good expense discipline. We're now up to two quarters of operating leverage, and we're working
towards driving our streak again.
The client activity across the board was strong, loan growth, deposit growth, net new households of Wealth
Management, GTS fees, capital markets activity, investment banking activity. And so, those investments across
the last several years continue to drive our strong growth and core market share. And in the end of the day, last
year was a record year of earnings and we returned $32 billion of capital to you, our shareholders.
Thank you for your support, and we look forward to talking to you next time.
