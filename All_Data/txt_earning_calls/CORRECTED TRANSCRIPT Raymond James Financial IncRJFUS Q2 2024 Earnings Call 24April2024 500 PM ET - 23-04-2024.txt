Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Kristie. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Once again, we delivered strong
results in the quarter, highlighting our diversified platform, we generated record results for the fiscal second
quarter and the first six months of the fiscal year. We continue to invest in our business, our people and
technology to help drive growth across all our businesses.
Before discussing quarterly results, I want to highlight an important announcement made last month. Following a
multi-year succession planning process, the board of directors appointed, Paul Shoukry, our CFO as President of
Raymond James. And following a transition period, Paul is expected to become the firm's CEO sometime during
the fiscal year 2025, becoming only the fourth Chief Executive in the company's 60-plus year history.
Paul has been an exceptional leader and a major contributor to Raymond James steady growth and financial
stability. I am confident he will continue to guide the firm with the same conservative long-term approach and
laser focus on our advisors and client first culture that has helped shape our success over the many years.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2024
In addition, we're proud to announce that other key leadership appointments to take effect October 1, 2024,
Private Client Group President, Scott Curtis will become COO of Raymond James Financial, moving into the role
following the retirement of Jeff Dowdle at the end of the fiscal year.
Tash Elwyn, current Raymond James & Associates CEO will become President of PCG; and Global Equities and
Investment Banking President, Jim Bunn, will become President of the Capital Markets Segment. These
expanded roles are a direct reflection of the significant leadership and contributions of Scott, Tash and Jim have
made over the years. I am confident, along with Paul, they will continue delivering on our mission to help clients
achieve their financial objectives.
Now to review the second quarter results starting on slide 5 (sic) [slide 4]. The firm reported record quarterly net
revenues of $3.12 billion, an increase of 9% over the preceding year quarter, primarily due to higher asset based
revenues.
Quarterly net income available to common shareholders was $474 million, or $2.22 per diluted share. Excluding
expenses related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $494 million, or
$2.31 per diluted share. The quarter included the favorable impact of a legal and regulatory net reserve release of
$32 million, predominantly driven by a reduction in the reserve related to the SEC off-platform communications
matter.
We generated strong returns for the quarter with annualized return on common equity of 17.5% and annualized
adjusted returns on tangible common equity of 21.8%. A great result, particularly given our strong capital base.
Moving on to slide 5, Client assets grew to record levels during the quarter, driven by rising equity markets and
solid advisor retention and recruiting in the Private Client Group. Total client assets under administration
increased 6% sequentially to $1.45 trillion. Private Client Group assets in fee-based accounts grew to $799 billion,
and financial assets under management reached $227 billion.
Domestic net new assets were $9.6 billion, representing a 3.2% annualized growth rate on the beginning of the
period domestic Private Client Group assets. This quarter does reflect some seasonality typical in the first
calendar quarter. And as we've seen before, net new assets can be volatile quarter-to-quarter as we onboard
newly recruited advisors and have advisors retire or leave the platform from time-to-time.
With our robust technology capabilities, client first values and longtime multiple affiliated options, PCG continues
to attract high quality advisors to the platform. For example, during the quarter, we recruited to our domestic
independent contractor and employee channels financial advisors with approximately $80 million of trailing 12
month production and $12.8 billion of client assets at their previous firm.
Fiscal year-to-date, trailing 12-month production of recruited advisors is up 45% and related assets up 77% over
the prior six-month period. There is a lag between recruiting results and net new assets as it takes some time for
clients to transition to the Raymond James platform. But we are encouraged by the recruiting success so far this
fiscal year and these results do not include our RIA and Custody Services business, which also continues to have
recruiting success and finished the quarter with $161 billion of client assets under administration.
Looking to our fiscal year-to-date results, domestic net new assets were $31.2 billion, representing a 5.7%
annualized growth rate on the beginning of period domestic PCG assets, a strong result compared to our peers.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2024
Total clients domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at $58.2 billion,
up slightly over December 2023. Bank loans were essentially flat from the preceding quarter at $44.1 billion, as
loan demand remains relatively muted given higher rates.
Moving on to slide 6. Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of $2.34 billion, and pre-tax
income of $444 million. Year-over-year results were driven by higher asset management fees, reflecting the
nearly 20% growth of assets in fee-based accounts at the beginning of the current quarter compared with the
same prior year period.
The Capital Markets segments generated quarterly net revenues of $321 million and a pre-tax loss of $17 million.
Net revenues grew 6% compared to a year ago quarter, primarily due to higher M&A and debt underwriting
revenues. Sequentially, revenues declined 5% due to lower fixed income brokerage revenues and M&A and
advisory revenues partially offset by higher debt underwriting revenues.
The pre-tax loss in Capital Markets of $17 million reflects the impact of amortization of deferred compensation
granted in preceding periods, which totaled $20 million this quarter. While the timing of closings remains difficult
to predict, we are encouraged by the healthy pipeline for new business activity and M&A. We continue to expect
investment banking revenues to improve along with the industry wide gradual recovery.
The Asset Management segment generated pre-tax income of $100 million on record net revenues of $252
million. Results were largely attributable to higher financial assets under management compared to the prior year
quarter due to market appreciation and net inflows into PCG fee-based accounts.
The Bank segment generated net revenues of $424 million and pre-tax income of $75 million. Bank segment net
interest margin of 2.66% declined 8 basis points compared to the preceding quarter, primarily due to the higher
cost mix of deposits, as the Enhanced Savings Program balances replaced a portion of the lower cost RJBDP
cash sweep balances.
Looking to the fiscal year-end date results on slide 7, we generated record net revenues of $6.13 billion and
record net income available to common shareholders of $971 million, up 8% and 4% respectively over the prior
year's record. Additionally, we generated strong annualized return on common equity of 18.3%, and an
annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 22.8% for the six-month period.
On slide 8, the strength of the PCG and Asset Management segment for the first half of the year primarily reflects
the strong organic growth in PCG with robust equity markets.
And now, I'll turn over to Paul Shoukry, our CFO, and soon to be CEO for the second quarter results. Paul?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry
President & Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. Starting on slide 10. Consolidated net revenues were $3.12 billion in the second quarter, up 9%
over the prior year, and up 3% sequentially. Asset management and related administrative fees grew to $1.52
billion, representing 16% growth over the prior year and 8% over the preceding quarter.
This quarter, PCG fee-based assets increased 7% which will be a strong tailwind for asset management and
related administrative fees in the fiscal third quarter. Brokerage revenues of $528 million grew 6% year-over-year,
mostly due to higher brokerage revenues in PCG, which were partially offset by lower fixed income brokerage

revenues, as depository clients continued to experience flat to declining deposit balances and have less cash
available for investing in securities.
Remember, in our fixed income business, we do not have the same exposure to the higher volatility currency and
credit products that have benefited many of the larger players in our industry during the quarter. I'll discuss
account and service fees and net interest income shortly. Investment banking revenues of $179 million increased
16% year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially. Compared to the prior year quarter, second quarter results
benefited from stronger debt underwriting revenues in both fixed income and public finance, as well as
improvement in M&A and advisory revenues, which continued to be subdued.
Moving to slide 11, clients' domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at
$58.2 billion, up slightly over the preceding quarter and representing 4.6% of domestic PCG client assets. Sweep
balances were essentially flat and ESP balances increased 3% sequentially, both outperforming our expectations
on the last call. Since the beginning of this quarter, domestic cash sweep balances have declined about $1.7
billion, mostly due to quarterly fee billings, along with income tax payments.
Turning to slide 12, combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $689 million, down
1% from the preceding quarter, largely reflecting one fewer billable day. Again, this result outperformed our
guidance on last quarter's call, given the more stable client cash balances.
Going forward, net interest income and RJBDP third-party fees will largely be dependent on the level of short-term
interest rates, the stability of client cash balances and the trajectory of loan growth, which has been subdued in
this rate environment. Fortunately, we are well positioned for the eventual recovery in loan growth with ample
capital and funding flexibility.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 13. Compensation expense was $2.04 billion, and the total
compensation ratio for the quarter was 65.5%. Excluding acquisition-related compensation expenses, the
adjusted compensation ratio was 65.2%. As is typical in the first calendar quarter, compensation expenses were
impacted by annual salary increases and the reset of payroll taxes.
All in, an adjusted compensation ratio, close to 65%, is in line with our current target and is the satisfactory result
given the challenging environment for the Capital Markets segment. Non-compensation expenses of $466 million
increased 1% sequentially, largely due to higher communications and information processing expenses and a
higher bank loan loss provision, which were partially offset by a favorable legal and regulatory net reserve release
of $32 million in the quarter, which Paul mentioned earlier.
For the fiscal year, we still expect non-compensation expenses, excluding provision for credit losses, unexpected
legal and regulatory items or non-GAAP adjustments to be around $1.9 billion. This implies incremental non-
compensation growth throughout the year, as we continue to invest in growth and ensure high service levels for
advisors and their clients throughout our businesses. Keep in mind, many of our non-compensation expenses
such as investment sub-advisory fees represent healthy growth that follows the corresponding revenue growth.
Slide 14 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. This quarter we generated a pre-tax margin
of 19.5%, and adjusted pre-tax margin of 20.4%, a strong result, especially given the challenging market
conditions impacting capital markets. As a reminder, our current targets provided at our Analyst and Investor Day
last May are for pre-tax margin of 20%-plus and a compensation ratio of less than 65%. We still think these
targets are appropriate and we will provide an update as needed at our upcoming Analyst Investor Day scheduled
for May 23.

On slide 15, at quarter end total balance sheet assets were $81.2 billion, a 1% sequential increase. Liquidity and
capital remain very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $2 billion, well above our $1.2
billion target. And we remain well capitalized with Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.3% and a total capital ratio of 23.3%.
Our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%, reflecting the favorable impact of non-taxable corporate owned
life insurance gains in the quarter. Looking ahead, we believe 24% is an appropriate estimate for the effective tax
rate.
Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. During the quarter, the firm
repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock for $207 million, at an average price of $122 per share, including
$43 million of shares repurchased in April, we completed the expected $250 million of these share repurchases
since January 1 and fulfilled the repurchase commitment associated with the dilution from the TriState Capital
acquisition.
As of April 19, 2024 approximately $1.14 billion remained under the board's approved common stock repurchase
authorization. Going forward, we expect to continue to offset share based compensation dilution and to be
opportunistic with incremental repurchases. We are committed to maintaining capital levels in line with our stated
targets. And we'll discuss more on our overall capital management strategy at our upcoming analyst Investor Day.
Lastly, on slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank
and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid. Criticized loans as a percentage of total
loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.21%, up from 1.06% from the preceding quarter. The bank loan
allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.06%. The
bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of the corporate loans held for
investment was 2.05% at quarter end. We believe this represents an appropriate reserve, but we continue to
closely monitor economic factors that may impact our loan portfolios.
Before I turn the call back over to Paul, I just want to say that I am absolutely honored to be named President and
future CEO of this great firm. I am excited to partner with my colleagues and friends Scott Curtis, Tash Elwyn, and
Jim Bunn in their expanded roles to continue leading Raymond James with the same values that guided Bob
James, Tom James and Paul Reilly since our founding. I am optimistic about our future. As all of our businesses
have critical mass, significant headroom for continued growth and a highly competent management team that
embody our firm's advisor and client first values.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. As I said at the start of the call, I'm pleased with our results for the fiscal second quarter and
through the first half of the fiscal year, generating record results and ending the quarter with record client assets.
And while there is still economic uncertainty, I believe we are in a position of strength to drive growth over the
long-term across all of our businesses.
In the Private Client Group, the next quarter results will be positively impacted by the 7% sequential increase of
assets in fee-based accounts. Our advisor recruiting activity remains robust and I am encouraged by a record

number of large teams in the pipeline. We are focused on being a destination of choice for our current and
prospective advisors which we believe over the long term should continue to drive industry leading growth.
In the Capital Markets segment, we continue to have a healthy M&A pipeline and good engagement levels. But
our expectations for a gradual recovery are heavily influenced by market conditions, and we could expect activity
to pick up over the next six to nine months.
And in the fixed income business, the overall dynamic of the past year remained unchanged. Depository clients
are experiencing flat to declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities, putting
pressure on our brokerage activity. We hope that once rate and cash balances stabilize, we will start to see an
improvement.
Overall, despite some of the near-term challenges, we believe the investments we've made in the capital markets
business have positioned us well for growth once the market and rate environment become conducive.
In the Asset Management segment, financial assets under management are starting the fiscal third quarter up 5%
over the preceding quarter, which should provide a tailwind to revenues. We remain confident that strong growth
of assets and fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial
assets under management. In addition, we expect Raymond James Investment Management to help drive further
growth over time.
In the Bank segment, we remain focused on fortifying the balance sheet with diverse funding sources and
prudently growing assets to support client demand. We have seen securities based loan payoffs decelerate and
we expect demand for these loans to recover as clients get comfortable with the current level of rates.
With little activity in the market, corporate loan growth has been muted. However, with ample client cash balances
and capital, we are well-positioned to lend once activity increases and our conservative risk guidelines. In addition
to driving organic growth across our businesses, we also remain focused on the corporate development efforts for
opportunities that may meet our disciplined M&A parameters.
In closing, we are well positioned entering the fiscal third quarter with a strong competitive positioning in all of our
business and solid capital and liquidity base to invest in future growth.
As always, I want to thank our advisors who drive this business and associates for their continued dedication to
providing excellent service to their clients. Thank you for all you do. That concludes our prepared remarks.
Operator, will you please open the line for questions?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Alex Blostein, Goldman Sachs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question and congrats to both of you guys. Well deserved. I wanted to start
with a question around comp. Maybe I understand there are some seasonal factors that impacted the quarter, but
maybe help break down how much the seasonal lift was. Specifically this quarter it feels a little bit heavier than
normal.
And then, Paul, I think I heard you say that you're kind of on target to 65% comp rate for the year. But then you
also said you're still shooting to be below 65% for the year. So maybe just kind of help reconcile where you guys
ultimately expect to end up for the full year? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, Alex, I appreciate that. What we said was that, the target that we announced at the last Analyst/Investor
Day was 65%. And so that's sort of where we've been trending in the first two quarters. But that's kind of – what it
does for the rest of the year is going to be largely dependent on the Capital Markets segment. That's a big driver.
Typically that would have a lower capital ratio – comp ratio associated with it than the other segments and help
the firm's overall comp ratio. And that wasn't the case this quarter, as you can calculate. So we were pleased to
be able to generate close to the 65.2% adjusted comp ratio despite the challenges in that Capital Markets
segment.
In terms of the reset of the payroll taxes and the increase in salaries, that's typical for the calendar first quarter of
each year. I would say that probably had an impact around $30 million to $35 million in the quarter. So, yeah,
meaningful impact in the quarter. Of course, the salary increases will continue throughout the year, but probably
two-thirds of that or so was related to the payroll tax reset, which will decline throughout the course of the
calendar year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
I got you. Thanks for that. My second question around recruiting activity. And if we look at the net new assets
disclosed in the quarter, organic growth is trending at a lower end from what we've seen from you guys
historically. And I guess, double clicking into that, it looks like the independent head count continues to be pretty
range bound. So maybe kind of walk us through what's been sort of pressuring the net new asset growth so far
this year, your expectations for the rest of the year. And then specifically, what you are seeing in the independent
channel that's been keeping the head count relatively flat? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think you're seeing the same trends that the teams we're hiring are larger, so we're bringing in more assets.
We're on a great roll in terms of assets in trailing 12. We do have head count that moves to our RIA channel and
that takes them out of head count because they're not licensed. So even with that movement, we can keep the

assets, but we're not keeping the head count. And we'll try to give you more granularity on Investor Day, Analyst
Day, and then you have the ins and outs.
So we do have some outs and the ins take time to on board. So the assets usually take – when you see a robust
quarter like let's say, the $1 million of trailing 12, we could take 9 months to a year to get all those assets over. So
our expectation is that the recruiting will continue and continue strong. And I think part of the transparency is we
need to give people more transparency on the RIA and how to think about that, we've struggled with the
measurement [indiscernible] (00:29:39) so you can see through those.

Operator: The next question is Steven Chubak, Wolfe Research.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Anagnostakis Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, good afternoon. This is Michael Anagnostakis on for Steven. I did want to ask one just on cash sweep. I
appreciate the commentary on how things have trended to start the quarter, and it was certainly nice to see that
sweep cash was flat in 1Q, but now tax season is behind us. So are you seeing signs that cash sweep is building
inflecting positively, and maybe just speak to your level of confidence that we can see absolute sweep cash
balances build from here? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, we had tax season. We also had a record quarterly fee billing that came out of the cash balances
already. And so, I look at today's report, cash sweep balances so far in April are down $1.3 billion, which is less
than the impact from the fee billings. Now, we had some decline in the Enhanced Savings Program so far this
April, too. And again, that could have been impacted.
We have tracked significant payments to the IRS with the tax season here. And if you look at the last couple of
quarters after the fee payments were made, cash kind of built throughout the quarter. And you saw that certainly
in this past quarter where cash sweep balances ended relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, which far exceeded our
expectations that we shared on the last call. So, we are hopeful that balances are stabilizing and so we'll kind of
continue monitoring it from here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Anagnostakis Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. And maybe just pivoting to DOL. Paul, on the last earnings call, I recall you were relatively comfortable with
Ray J's positioning and that you expected the industry to challenge the new rule. With the final DOL rule now
published, maybe you can update us on your views in terms of what the rule in its finalized state means for the
industry as well as any implications for Ray J that you would highlight? Thanks.

Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, yeah. So, I appreciate the question. Digesting 500 pages of a regulatory rule is a little more – even more
complicated than trying to get through our earnings release. So, we'll analyze that. So, it's early. The early read is
actually from the rule itself is, we – there is nothing that pops out that's overly problematic or actually maybe
surprisingly so.
I think the industry's concern will be two. One is that, does the Department of Labor even have the authority to
oversee these accounts? And that doesn't have to do with this rule. I don't think the rule itself will have a high
impact. But do we want another regulator that can see – the statutory authority for the regulator to oversee those
accounts?
And the other thing is, if the rule is talking about really complying with best interest standard, why is there an extra
rule. But the rule itself is, I think much more manageable than the draft rule was. So again, that's an early read.
The devil is always in the detail, but I don't think the rule itself from what it requires to do today is, it doesn't look
too problematic at all.

Michael Y. Cho Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. My first one, I just wanted to follow-up on M&A again. I mean,
just you talked through a healthy pipeline looking ahead. But just in the quarter, again you also talked to some
seasonality and some lumpiness. I was just curious, if there's anything else you can call out or any more color on
nuances between maybe some of the affiliation models that you talk through and maybe anything to call out in
terms of how maybe attrition is trending as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
If you look for the first six months, I think compared to the industry in the 5s, I think we did pretty well. So, this
quarter was slower in terms of the number. Typically, this is little lower, but a lower – maybe a little lower than we
would have thought in terms of the number itself. But the recruiting is going well, the movement to RIA you could
see that net new assets growth was pretty robust.
I mean, net asset growth was pretty robust, so I think it actually was a – we have quarters where things are down
and quarters where things are up and I just think it was down a little more than we anticipated from a
measurement standpoint. But the recruiting not only and what we brought in this quarter, but what we have in the
pipeline, I think we have a relatively good chance of closing. And I can't remember ever being stronger.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2024
So, the numbers will be impacted by in terms of advisor count how many go to RIA and then hopefully the ones
that do will choose to stay with us. And we've had a pretty good record on it so far.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Y. Cho Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. Fair enough. And then just switching gears to the Capital Markets business. I mean, I realize
some of that is driven by that deferred comp that you called out and maybe still recovering M&A environment. I
guess, so with that backdrop potentially improving from here and Raymond James' history of investing in talent as
well. I mean, how would you frame your willingness to go after incremental talent in the advisory business over
the next, call it, 9 to 12 months?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So we've done a lot of adjusting in terms of the costs knowing the cost in that business. But we've also
done some hiring. So, the business is very – leverage the upside if revenue comes up. I mean, so the margin two
years ago was what 50% or something. I mean, so now it's not – so, I mean there's leverage for the revenue to
grow to really help with that margin. So the question is just the market and we're open always to bring in talent. I
think we showed in 2009 and the worst part of we were hiring when other people aren't, really paid off for our
growth through the whole next decade.
And so, that is the blessing of a really strong capital position. And so, we have the opportunity even in tough
markets to hire, carry and really position talent to bring us forward. We've done some fixed public finance hiring
that we're already seeing payoff from in the last – this quarter and this coming quarter, that if you looked at just
the results of public finance, the way they've done it, but we're again great believers in the business, the platform.
And if there's great talent out there, we're willing to take the long-term investment and some liquidity and
capitalized support to do that.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Investment Bank
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats to both of you. I'm curious about the idea now that
we're starting to see capital markets get going, activity begin to pick up. How should we think about incremental
margins in that business for you, given how weak the profitability has been? I would assume that they would be
pretty good. But could you help us get a sense of what a incremental dollar of revenue would mean from an
incremental margin perspective?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2024
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I think maybe the only thing we can really point to is, the margins peaking out in the mid-20s. I think it was
25%, 26% in 2021-2022 in that time period. And so there's a lot of upside to the margins from where we are
today. And just remember this quarter was impacted by $20 million of deferred comp amortization from those
record years as well, which will run off over the course of the next 12 to 18 months because those are three-year
deferrals typically.
So there's a lot of upside. We have a very strong franchise now in investment banking. The pipelines and the
leading activity levels are good. Closings are difficult to predict just in this market environment. But, we think
there's a lot of upside to both the top and bottom line in our Capital Markets segment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And if we didn't, we would be doing – we'd be taking a lot of different actions than we've taken so far. I think we've
prudently cut expenses and making sure that we have the right people on the field, but we think we have a great
team and as the market recovers, I believe they'll do very well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Investment Bank
Sure. Fair enough. And then thinking about the improving environment, if we continue to see signs of recovering
strength in your core businesses, will that increase confidence and improve the likelihood for a better outlook for
capital returns and buybacks?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I think our capital philosophy hasn't changed in that we would love to add to the business, invest in the
business first. And certainly, our recruiting of ongoing large investments, which is certainly I don't think anyone
thinks is a bad investment. We're looking for M&A opportunities and are active in the market. But we can't predict
the timing.
And certainly, we're committed to buy dilution back and be opportunistic, but we don't want the capital levels. We
think that these levels are high. And we want to manage on it. So we will be meeting with the board and I think by
the Analyst and Investor Days may have better insight to how we may do that. But the profitability, we're not trying
to hoard capital and benefit us, but we'll always be higher probably than most firms. But this is a pretty robust
level. We acknowledge that, so.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Investment Bank
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think our commitment for those on this call, thinking we'd do a buyback that averaged $120 plus, you would have
thought we would have done that even a quarter or two ago. So we're trying to manage the levels.

Operator: The next question is Dan Fannon, Jefferies.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good evening. Just to follow up on that last question, can you talk about M&A and really what do you
think makes the most sense in terms of strategic fit from a product, geography or scale perspective?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, we could go into a long, I mean, that's a hard question to answer quickly. I mean, our primary geographies
are North America and then Europe that we look for the best opportunities. In each business the opportunities are
different, in our private client group, it's really North America and the UK. Our M&A group is much broader. We're
on the continent, not really in Asia, but not against M&A capability more than we have today, asset management,
it's particular products, and we can go on and on and on.
So we think in all the areas of the firm, there are areas that we can grow that strategically help us through
acquisition, but that would be a lot longer in lot more detail than that general question. So, each business has
different needs, M&A, we think there are areas that we could expand. The private client group, we think our
geographies, we've done well in the Northeast but could do more and we're really focused on growing in the West
more robustly, so the answer is a lot of areas, if we can find the right opportunities and make a reasonable return
for shareholders that we would execute on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Understood. And then, as you think about NII going forward, and you mentioned in the kind of cash trends and
some stabilization there. On the loan growth side, any signs of pickup in potential demand there? Or as you think
about the rest of this year, what are the kind of most sensitive factors as we think about that line item in terms of
up or down?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, as you know, loan growth has been tepid not only for us, but for the really entire banking industry since
rates started rising over the last 12 to 16 months. And a lot of that is due to just the higher rate environment and a
lot of corporations and investors coming into this environment flush with cash. We are optimistic about loan
growth going forward. We don't know exactly when that inflection point will hit, but we do think that there's a
demand building up, both for companies who will eventually get back engaged in M&A and other investing
activities as well as the private client group investors.
So, one of the reasons that we are maintaining strong capital and funding positions and a lot of flexibility is to be
in a position of strength when that loan growth does resume. Because it is just a matter of, in our minds, just a
matter of timing for when that loan growth recovers. And so, we're well positioned for it. We don't know when that
will come back, but we're optimistic about the growth going forward.

Operator: Up next is a question from Mark McLaughlin, Bank of America.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark McLaughlin Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations to you both. I wanted to get your take with
regard to advisor movements. What have you guys been seeing on your ends in terms of advisors leaving
wirehouses and also competition between independent broker dealers? Is there anything to call out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Just that the competition is still robust, I mean, the advisor movement, especially of large teams, has been –
where we have been focused has been big. I think private equity's investment into the RIA space has caused
more movement too into outside of the independent broker dealers than employee broker dealers. So that's kind
of a new factor for us. So, part of the reasons why a decade ago we started investing to have our RIA channel, so
we could be competitive.
So yeah, I mean I can't remember a time where there hasn't been a lot of competition, but we still see wirehouse
movement in our favor. I think that you're seeing more people not reporting advisor count for that reason. But we
see a lot of activity, but it's competitive. There are a lot of people out there competing. And at the end of the day,
it's not just money. I think what people think the highest bidders get it if you look at our – we just saw the latest
industry [ph] SARS (00:46:15) were still lower than most firms by a fair margin in our transition assistance. But it's
clearly up from a couple of years ago, reflecting the competition. So, it's competitive, but we believe our platform
is what lands people in our culture. And so far, it's continuing, but it's not easy. It's hard work.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark McLaughlin Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Thanks. I appreciate that color. And then I'm sure we'll get an update on this at the Investor Day. But with respect
to RCS, what are you guys seeing in terms of advisors moving, especially the size of those advisors? I realize for
the most part, it's usually advisors once they reach kind of sort of a critical mass. Are you seeing the size of the
advisors wanting to move over to RIA kind of move down in scale?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Look, in the market, there's certainly a lot of movement of smaller teams that want to become RIAs and big teams
that have the infrastructure to be RIA. So, the movement is really kind of across the board. Larger teams
[indiscernible] (00:47:28) positives and challenges of RIAs, is you can affiliate with a firm, but they have multiple
custodians.
So, I think that if you look at set large RIAs, some of the big custodial firms, they still move asset sometimes. So,
you don't have to have a firm affiliate with you to be an asset gainer too. So, the dynamic of that, it's a much more
dynamic industry in that way. It's kind of all or none in the registered rep side and it's a fight for wallet on the RIA
side.

Operator: We'll now take a question from Kyle Voigt, KBW.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good evening. I just have a couple of follow ups. Maybe first just to follow up on Dan's M&A question. And I
guess just to be clear on the capital point, do you feel like you have enough capital flexibility today with the current
leverage ratios to act on the M&A opportunities that you're seeing in the market? Or is the near-term guidance on
buybacks to offset dilution and imply continued near term capital build due to maybe wanting a bit more flexibility
due to the size of the acquisition opportunities that you're seeing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think we're in the ballpark of flexibility. The question just is that question, maybe you see something where it
could be bigger, but you can't just wait and wait and wait with total capital. We've drifted up once, if I remember,
right, all 14% or something. And people are saying what are you doing? But we had three deals that we executed
in one year that brought it down. So, we hit 10% and it's been building back up. So, if it was so smooth and we
could forecast that it would be real easy, right. But M&A kind of hits, deals sometimes come almost out of the blue
or someone just decides they're going to sell.
And so, that's why if we average up sometimes, we feel like the market will have opportunities that we can
foreshadow. But that doesn't mean we're right. There's one thing to enter into a discussion, it's another thing for a
seller to agree. It's time and pick us and to close. So that's the challenge. But many of the deals that we have
closed is because we could execute and we could – we were – not only were they attractive to us, but there was a
certainty of closing both financially and that we had enough cash on hand that it wasn't a leap that we – in the
financing because we're not leveraged isn't a leap, but we can close very, very quickly.
So I wish I could give you a science to it. There's little more art to it and that's – we would love to be as clear as
we can on this, but if we had the magic formula, we would let you know or at least package it and sell it to our
competitors.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just for a follow up on the loan balances, I think you gave some
commentary on SBLs a few quarters ago that you actually see some decent demand and some of the
acceleration in that book. The growth of that book that you were seeing in the calendar third quarter was due to
some paydown slowing. So I guess, a bit surprising to see that growth has stalled out here in the past quarter.
Just wondering if you can provide any additional color on what's happening in the SBL book specifically, which is
flat lines here? And then, do you think the market really just needs to wait for rates to move lower before demand
broadens again?

Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
It was flattish for us, as you point out, sequentially, as it was, I think, through the rest of the industry at least those
who've reported thus far. So, I'm not sure you necessarily need to wait for rates to decrease. It's just maybe a
stabilization of rates, even as borrowers get used to sort of the new norm. So, I think that's really what we're
seeing as we transition from historically low rates to where our current level is at an unprecedented pace. It's just
a lot of people are still getting used to – and companies are still getting used to this level of rates.

Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys, Morgan Stanley.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Cyprys Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask on organic asset growth. I think in the past you've
suggested that most of the growth and any growth that you're seeing is from recruiting. Just curious how you think
about an opportunity set over time from maybe providing advisors with more services to enhance their efficiency
and unlock growth from the installed advisor base to grow same-store sales?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think our focus internally is first to our existing advisors, both technology and capabilities, to make sure they're
spending as much time as they can with their clients and acquiring new clients. It makes the advisors happy, that
means your clients are happy to achieve this growth for us. So, our focus – and it's [ph] evolves the (00:53:13)
platforms for other advisors that want to come to. So, the tools we put out, the technology we put out, the back
office, modernization, all of that is to help advisor productivity and that does drive a lot of our growth and what we
do and keeps advisors here.
This is a market and, frankly, the market has been this way for a while where almost any advisor could leave and
they will get a lot of money for their book and start somewhere else, but they stay here because of that. So, that's
a big focus of ours. That's where we pay a lot of attention. Number one is on retention. And I think part of our
growth rates have been driven by our retention rates too and our recruiting. So, I'm not sure if there's more of the
question, but that's kind of focus number one is to make the existing advisors happy and productive.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2024
Michael J. Cyprys Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. And then just on the loan book, just curious where you think you're underpenetrated as you look at the
portfolio today, and if you look out over the next couple years, how would you sort of like the composition and size
of the book to evolve? And are there any additional capabilities you feel you may need to build out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, there's two pieces to that. We're underpenetrated compared to wirehouses in terms of loans to clients. You
would say, yes, but our other thing is we take a position with advisors, your job is to do the right thing for your
clients. And if our loans or if you like our mortgage loans, use them. If you don't, if it's something's better else for
your clients, use it.
So, our job is to provide competitive products and your advisors job is to figure out what's appropriate for their
client to use. So, we do not have quotas, we do not put incentives, some people have product incentives for their
top [ph] top reps (00:55:16) or their managers have quotas to try to do that. We have none of that. We just want
advisors to do what's best for the business and then we try to develop compelling products and services that they
can educate, that they can use on, use to help their clients.
So, our numbers industry-wide are lower, but we understand why, because we're not pushing it or we do it
through education, not through trying to use incentives to get them to do it. So, now you can talk about from a
capital allocation standpoint that might be different from our side of what loans we'd like to grow. The good news
for us is, we like the private client group loans, the SBLs and mortgages, the other things that they have, not only
SBLs; have our best risk adjusted return, they're secured. And they're good for clients and they're flexible for
clients. So, we're matched up that way.
So, our challenges are more where do we want to go and whether it's the commercial banking section or how
much [ph] do we want (00:56:27) investment securities now that that are more of a financial decision and long-
term investment. So, penetration is a good question. We are lower, but we don't try to force it. We want our
advisors to do it if it's the right thing for the clients.

margin. Sort of wondering if you could talk a little bit about maybe where the exit level might be for the new

tepid type of loan backdrop for now, how do you sort of see that playing out if the sorting starts to ease a little bit
as well? Thank you.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2024
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would say, a lot of the shift in cash balances from on balance sheet to third party banks have really
occurred in the last couple of quarters. So, the NIM going forward is going to be more driven by, one, the absolute
level of rates and what happens with short-term rates going forward, and also to the asset mix to the extent. We're
a little heavy right now on the bank balance sheet and cash balances going back to the comments I made earlier
about wanting to be in a position of strength when loan demand recovers, and so that brings down the NIM all
else being equal.
But it's at least a push, if not a modest positive to NII, net interest income and earnings. But in the meantime, it
does drag down the NIM a bit as we hold more cash balances than we think we would need on a run rate basis.
So as far as a jumping off point, I think it is a relatively stable number from where we were this quarter. We're not
shifting – proactively shifting cash balances off balance sheet to third-party banks that we were doing over the last
couple of quarters. So I think that's all fairly well reflected this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Katz Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Great. That's helpful. And just try and triangulate a combination of the senior executive leadership changes. Your
comments, Paul Shoukry, about sort of the platform being in a very good spot with scale. Where are you investing
right now as you think through maybe the comp or non-comp side and how might the strategic vision be evolving
as you sort of migrate to the next generation of leaders? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I mean, we have been consistently investing in all of our businesses. First and foremost, the largest business by
far is our private client group business and we don't anticipate that changing. So that's where the vast majority of
our investment dollars go. But we also invest heavily in growth in the capital markets, asset management and the
bank businesses, and they're all great businesses. If you look at the last three years and even the first half of this
fiscal year, being able to generate record revenues and earnings in very different market environments is a
testament and a reflection of having a diversified business model.
So we're going to continue to invest in very high service levels, continue to invest in technology to enhance the
service levels and create more efficiencies for advisors so they could spend more time with clients, as Paul was
touching on earlier. So kind of maybe a long winded way of saying there's not going to be a dramatic change
because everything is really working very well and has been since our founding in 1962 and being focused on
essentially the same businesses that we're focused on today. And so that's sort of our plan going forward.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2024
Hey. Yeah, thanks so much for squeezing me in and obviously want to echo the congratulation as well to Paul
Shoukry and the others on the leadership team now on the call and to Paul Reilly as well, the stock I think was
trading at about $10 when you joined in 2009. I remember those days pretty well. And so unquestionably a
successful run and a well-earned transition. So congratulations.
I wanted real quick a couple here on fixed income brokerage. You had a very significant step up in the first quarter
off of the back half of 2023 and then that took a step back again in the second quarter. And just curious, was that
just a shift in activity in depositories just with the changes in rate expectations? Or is something else going on
there? And just how to think about that business relative to maybe the second quarter coming off point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, it was couple quarters ago, the rates came down quite – the yields came down quite a bit, and gave
depositories a repositioning opportunity. And on the call last quarter I think we talked about that repositioning
opportunity being somewhat episodic in nature and throughout the course of this quarter, the rates actually went
up again. And so, the underlying factors that Paul discussed on the call in his prepared remarks was that
depositories are still struggling to grow deposit balances or keep deposit balances flat.
And so they're going to be prudent and slow to reinvest in securities in this environment and that's the largest part
of our fixed income business. So we continue to expect some headwinds there until deposit balances start
growing again and banks feel more confident investing in their securities portfolio. Meanwhile, some which has
been nice in that it has diversified the fixed income revenue streams with its corporate trading technology enabled
capability.
And so – but that business thrives on volatility. In this past quarter spread and the rate volatility wasn't as
significant, so they didn't have sort of the uplift that they had in the preceding quarters.

Great. We appreciate you all coming on and good quarter, already on to the next quarter and I think we've got
some good tailwind, so we look forward to it. And I'm not sure I look forward to hearing all these generational
comments about how old I am and how ready Paul is, but he is ready. And so, I think, you're going to see a lot of
good things from Raymond James. So thanks for joining us today.
