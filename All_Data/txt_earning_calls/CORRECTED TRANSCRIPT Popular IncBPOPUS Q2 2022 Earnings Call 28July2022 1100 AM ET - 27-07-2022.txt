Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Good morning and thank you for joining the call. The second quarter was another strong one in which we
achieved income of $211 million. Our results reflect the strength of economic activity in our markets, our
diversified sources of revenue and prudent risk management. Our quarter net income was in line with the first
quarter and $7 million lower than the same quarter of 2021. Compared to the first quarter, second quarter results
were characterized by positive variances in net interest income and fee income, which were offset by higher
provision for credit losses, operating expenses and tax rate.
During the quarter loan growth was solid and broad-based both geographically and across most loan segments.
Commercial loan growth was particularly healthy during the period at both Banco Popular and Popular Bank. Our
margin in Puerto Rico improved in the second quarter, but continues to be impacted by our asset mix. We are
positioned to benefit from higher market rates, although to a lesser extent due to lower asset sensitivity. Credit
quality trends continue to be favorable during the period with a low level of net charge-offs and decreasing non-
performing loans.
On July 1st, we closed the previously announced agreement with Evertec to acquire key customer facing
channels and to extend important commercial agreements. This transaction will allow us to continue to accelerate
our ongoing digital and business transformation as we continue improving our client experience. With the ability to
manager – manage our key customer channels and greater flexibility to choose our technology partners, we will
be able to enhance the service and customer solutions that we offer with greater agility. We will continue to
enhance our omnichannel experience to meet the changing needs and expectations of our clients. Finally, we
continue returning capital to our shareholders. On July 12, we completed the previously announced $400 million
accelerated share repurchase program.
Please turn to slide 4. Our customer base in Puerto Rico grew by approximately 6,000 in the second quarter to
reach 1.96 million unique customers. Adoption of digital channels among our retail customers continues to be
strong. Active users on our Mi Banco platform exceeded 1.1 million or 57% of our customer base. Additionally,
we're now capturing nearly two-thirds of our deposits through digital channels. This trends remained significantly
higher than pre-pandemic levels.
Commercial loan growth was strong, excluding PPP loans commercial loan balances at BPPR, PB increased by
$327 million and $275 million respectively. Auto loan and lease balances at BPPR increased by $114 million or
2% versus the first quarter. The dollar value of credit and debit card sales of our customers remained at very
healthy levels during the quarter, just 1% below the high watermark said during last year's second quarter. Well,
there continues to be strong demand for housing in Puerto Rico mortgage originations have been impacted by
rising rates and limited inventory of available properties. The dollar value of mortgage originations at BPPR
decreased by 42% compared to the second quarter of last year.
Please turn to slide 5 for an update on the current macro environment in Puerto Rico. The local economy
continued to perform well during the second quarter as business activity and customer spending remained strong.
The Puerto Rico Economic Activity Index, which includes total employment, cement sales, electricity generation
and gasoline sales has been steadily improving and has exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the last seven months.
We may encouraged by the strong employment levels in the second quarter, total amount of unemployment in
Puerto Rico reached its highest level in a decade.
The June 2022 unemployment rate of 6.1% is the lowest for at least the past 60 years. It is especially
encouraging that the decrease in the unemployment rate was accompanied by continues stability in the

participation rate. New auto sales increased by 10% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2021,
but remained above pre-pandemic levels. The auto industry continues to be affected by supply chain product
shortages. Despite these challenges, there continues to be robust demand for cars in Puerto Rico.
The tourism and hospitality sector continues to be a source of strength for the local economy, as Puerto Rico is a
popular destination for mainland residents. Airport traffic has remained robust year-to-date, total passenger traffic
has increased by 17% compared to 2021. Hotel demand has also remained strong. In June occupancy rates in
Puerto Rico were 77%, year-to-date the average daily room rate is nearly $300, which is the highest level in more
than a decade. In short, we are very pleased with our results for a second quarter, while attentive to the evolving
geopolitical and inflation risks and their impact on the economy and our clients, we continue to be optimistic about
the prospects for the future.
I will now turn the call over to Carlos for more details on our financial results.

Carlos J. Vázquez
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio. Good morning. Please turn to slide 6. As usual, additional information is provided in the
appendix of the slide deck. Today's earnings press release details variances from the first quarter. Net interest
income for the second quarter was $534 million, an increase of $40 million from Q1. The variance was driven by
higher yield on investment securities, as well as higher income from loan growth at both banks. This was
somewhat offset by lower BPPR related income and slightly higher interest expense on deposits.
Non-interest income increased by $3 million to $157 million. Other service fees increased due to higher credit and
debt interchange and fees, resulting from growth in purchasing activity during Q2. This was partially offset by
lower income from investments held under the equity method by $3 million. We expect that the average level of
quarterly non-interest income will remain at around $155 million to $160 million for the rest of 2022.
The provision for credit losses for the second quarter was an expense of $5 million compared to a benefit of $16
million in the first quarter. Total operating expenses were $406 million in the quarter, an increase of $4 million
from Q1. The increase was driven primarily by three factors, higher professional fees by $6 million due to higher
processing and service charges. Credit and debit card processing expenses were up by $4 million due to
increased customer activity, and personnel costs were $2 million higher, driven mostly by profit sharing plan
accruals.
These expense increases were partially offset by a $6 million decrease in other operating expenses, primarily due
to lower legal reserves. And lower OREO expenses by $5 million due to gains on the sale of OREO properties.
For the remaining two quarters of this year, we now expect expenses to average $445 million per quarter. This
brings the total average quarterly expenses for 2022 to $425 million, up from the previous guidance of $415
million.
The increase is driven by the following. First, given our results year-to-date, we anticipate a full year 2022 net
income will exceed the threshold required to trigger employee profit sharing. As such, we are not including the
anticipated expense for the year into our outlook. Second, during the quarter, we undertook a broad-based market
review of employee compensation to ensure that we remain competitive. The outcome of this process led to
higher employee salaries across the corporation, which will increase our personal expense run rate starting in the
second half of this year.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Third, the evolution of market regulatory expectations as well as increased customer activity will require us to
continue to increase expenditures in certain areas such as compliance, fraud and cybersecurity. And finally, given
the pace of change in the financial services sector, we will incur additional expenses as we invest in our digital
offerings and launch other early stage initiatives to enhance our customer experience.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23% compared to 19% in the first quarter. This increases primarily due
to higher mix of taxable income. For the full year 2022, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 17% and
20%. This range includes the impact of mark-to-market accounting on Evertec Holdings resulting from the
expected reduction in our boarding interest in Evertec. The gains resulting from mark-to-market are taxed our
preferential rate.
Please turn to slide 7. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $596 million, 47 million higher than
the first quarter. Net interest margin increased by 34 basis points to 3.09% in Q2. On a taxable equivalent basis
NIM was 3.45% and increased to 40 bps. The improved net interest margin is driven by the higher interest rate
environment and by improved asset mix, specifically a lower proportion of money market investments and the
increase in higher yielding loans. Higher yields on money market and investment portfolio by 44 basis points, and
an increase in loan yield by 8 basis points to 6.14%.
PPP income in Q2 was $5 million, down from $11 million in the prior quarter, due to lower recognition of fees
upon loan forgiveness and lower balances. The yield on portfolio was 15% compared to 17% in Q1. The
outstanding quarter end balance of PPP loans was $89 million. The remaining unamortized portion of fees for this
portfolio is $3.3 million, most of which we expect to recognize during the third quarter. Excluding Puerto Rico
public deposits, deposit balances grew by $255 million in the quarter. As of the end of the second quarter public
deposits were roughly $17 billion, an increase of $2 billion from Q1. At this time, we continue to expect that public
deposits will return to a rate of $11 billion to 15 billion by year-end.
While we remain asset-sensitive, disposition has been reduced significantly by our deployment of cash balances
initially to the bond portfolio and more recently to fund loan growth. Given the rapid shift to higher short-term rates
moving forward, we expect the cost of public sector deposits to start moving in tandem with market rates, albeit
with a lag. As a result of these factors, these 25 basis point change in Fed funds rate now corresponds to an
increase of approximately $2 million in NII per quarter. We expect our interest rate sensitivity to become relatively
neutral to higher rate scenarios in the coming quarters.
Our ending loan balances increased by $787 million or 3% compared to Q1 and are up by $1.1 billion or 4% year-
to-date. The quarterly increase occurred despite a decrease of $85 million in PPP loans. All segments except for
mortgage in Puerto Rico were higher with commercial loan growth being particularly strong. We are encouraged
by the demand for credit at BPPR and at PB. We will continue to take advantage of opportunities to extend credit
to improve the use and yield of our existing liquidity.
Please turn to slide 8. Our return on tangible equity was 16.7% in the quarter. Capital levels remain strong. Our
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in Q2 was 16.4%, roughly unchanged from Q1.
On July 12, the corporation completed a previously P&Ls $400 million ASR. In total, we repurchased
approximately 5.1 million shares at an average purchase price of $78.94 per share. Tangible book value at
quarter end was $46.18 per share, an 11% decrease driven mostly by higher accumulated unrealized losses on
debt securities available for sale of $563 million a result of rising interest rates. This was partially offset by net
income in the quarter. The decrease in fair value of the investment portfolio should be temporary. Our investment

portfolio is nearly entirely comprised of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, which carry minimal
credit risk.
The bond portfolio has a duration of approximately four years, as the positions grow down the yield curve, their
fair value will converge to par and they mark down to zero. During the quarter new purchases of debt securities in
the investment portfolio were categorized as held-to-maturity. The lower mark-to-market valuation of our
investment portfolio does not have an impact on our regulatory capital ratios.
On July 1, we completed a previously announced agreement with Evertec to acquire key customer facing
channels and to extend important commercial agreements. As consideration for the transaction BPPR delivered
to Evertec approximately 4.6 million shares of Evertec common stock valued at the closing of $169 million. This
resulted in after tax gain of approximately $112 million. In terms of capital, the transaction resulted in a negative
impact to tangible book value of approximately $55 million due to the net effect of the after tax gain of the Evertec
shares used as consideration for the transaction minus approximately $167 million in goodwill and other intangible
assets recognized in connection with the transaction and finally, the effect of purchase accounting related
adjustments.
As a result of the transfer of the shares used as consideration Popular's ownership in Evertec was reduced from
approximately 16.3% to approximately 10.6% at closing. Popular has agreed to further reduce its voting interest in
Evertec to no more than 4.5% whether through selling shares of Evertec common stock or a conversion of such
shares into non-voting stock by the end of the third quarter. We expect to sell down the stake in Evertec to no
more than 4.5%, depending on market conditions.
Subject to receipt of regulatory approvals, we intend to plan to return to shareholders via common stock
repurchases, any after-tax gains resulting from such sale. We also intend to complete the remaining $100 million
worth of buybacks under our 2022 capital plan by year end. Our normal capital planning scheduled to result in an
announcement of Popular's 2023 capital actions no later than our January 2023 webcast. We'll continue to
explore opportunities to manage our capital structure during the remainder of 2022 and in future periods.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lidio.

Lidio V. Soriano
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Carlos, and good morning. Overall, Popular continue to experience strong credit quality trends and
low credit costs with low levels of net charge offs and decreasing nonperforming loans. We continue to closely
monitor changes in borrower performance and the macroeconomic environment, given potential economic
headwinds, rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. However, we believe that the improvement over the
last few years in the risk profile of the corporation's loan portfolios positions Popular to operate successfully under
more difficult economic conditions.
Turning to slide number 9. Non-performing assets decreased by $40 million to $570 million this quarter, mainly
driven by NPL decrease of $42 million. The decreasing NPLs was mainly in Puerto Rico. This was driven by lower
mortgage NPLs of $22 million, primarily due to the combined effects of collection efforts, increased foreclosure
activity and the ongoing low levels of early delinquency compared with pre-pandemic trends. Coupled with lower
commercial NPLs of $21 million, primarily due to the return to accrual status of $11 million commercial
relationships.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
In the US, NPLs remain flat quarter-over-quarter. Compared to the first quarter inflows to NPL excluding
consumer loans, decreased by $5 million.
In Puerto Rico, total inflows decreased by $6 million, driven by lower commercial inflows of $4.5 million and lower
mortgage inflows of $1.5 million. In the US, inflows remained flat quarter-over-quarter. The $2 million order
increase in the quarter was driven by the resumption of foreclosure activity in the Puerto Rico mortgage portfolio.
At the end of the quarter, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held-in-portfolio was 1.6% compared to 1.8% in the
previous quarter.
Turning to slide number 10, net charge offs amounted to $6 million or annualized 8 basis points of average loans
held-in-portfolio compared to $4 million or 5 basis points in the prior quarter. In Puerto Rico, net charge-offs were
$5 million flat quarter-over-quarter. In the US, net charge-offs reflected a negative variance of $2.5 million as the
prior quarter was – of $1.7 million compared to an expense of $800,000 this quarter. The corporation allowance
for credit losses increased by $4 million to $682 million. The increase was mainly in Puerto Rico driven by
portfolio growth and changes to macroeconomic scenarios.
In the US, ratio was flat quarter-over-quarter. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans held-in-portfolio
decreased by 5 basis point to 2.24%. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to NPLs held-in-portfolio was 143%,
compared to 130% in the prior quarter. The provision for credit losses was an expense of $10 million compared to
a benefit of $14 million in the previous quarter. In Puerto Rico, the provision for credit losses was an expense of
$9 million compared to a benefit of $30 million. While in the US the provision was an expense of $1 million
compared to a benefit of $2 million.
Please turn to slide number 11. As discussed in prior webcasts, we leverage Moody's Analytics for US and Puerto
Rico economic forecasts. Moody's baseline forecasts expects growth to continue in 2022 and 2023, with some
slowing occurring as the economy reaches full employment. Monetary policy becomes tighter, COVID-19 fiscal
stimulus ends, and the Russia war in Ukraine affects energy and food prices. However, Moody's Analytics puts
the odds of the economy that the company will suffer a downturn beginning in the next 12 months at one in three,
with near even ups of a recession in the next 24 months.
As a result, we continue to assign the highest probability to the baseline scenario, followed closely by the more
pessimistic S3 scenario. To summarize, our loan portfolio continue to see strong credit quality trends in the
second quarter with low net charge offs and decreasing nonperforming loans. We continue to closely monitor
changes in borrower performance under the macroeconomic environment. However, we believe that
improvements over time and the risk profile of the corporation loans portfolios positions Popular to operate
successfully under more difficult economic environments.
With that I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks. Thank you.

Thank you, Lidio and Carlos, for your updates. Our results for the first half of 2022 were strong, driven by solid
earnings, robust loan growth, improved credit quality and continued customer growth. Our capital liquidity position
provides us the flexibility to invest for growth, we continue returning capital to our shareholders. Despite the
possible negative impacts of inflation, higher interest rates and the war in Ukraine, we are still seeing growth in
the US and Puerto Rico with a historically strong employment market and healthy consumer deposit and spending
levels.

In the case of Puerto Rico, in addition to the unprecedented level of federal stimulus related to COVID, there is
still a significant amount of hurricane recovery funds that are yet to be disbursed. We expect that the combined
impact of these factors will generate considerable economic activity in many sector for the coming years, and we
are well-positioned to benefit from such activity. In June, we released our Corporate Sustainability Report, which
is available on our website. We have continued to further our ESG efforts with a focus on promoting sustainable
finance, supporting our communities, and fostering a strong culture of diversity, equity and inclusion.
We are mindful of the responsibility we have to Puerto Rico as the leading banking institution and to all the
communities that we serve. I am thankful to our entire team who have continued to perform at a high level and
deliver results under the adverse conditions. We recently completed a comprehensive market analysis that
resulted in a significant investment in compensation. Our employees are Popular's greatest asset and it is a
priority for us to invest in their continued growth and success. We are confident in our ability to continue to deliver
results to our shareholders at the same time as we invest in our people, business and communities.

Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Congratulations on double-digit loan growth. I didn't think I'd be saying that but the Puerto Rican environment, but
obviously strong growth and the economy continues to move along. I wanted to make sure I understood what the
outlook was in the back half of the year for loan growth. I know that year-over-year auto sales were down 9% in
June, but they continue to be pretty robust and the commercial activity was notable this quarter. Maybe, Carlos,
any thoughts on or Ignacio any thoughts on back half loan growth from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
The commercial loan growth, we said it before, is kind of lumpy. So it's hard for us to predict that. But I can
definitely say that we continue to see strong interest from our clients in the commercial sector, regarding demand
8

for loans. So we don't see any decrease in that. As you saw, the consumer balances increase across both lines.
Also so we're not seeing any negative impact there.
There's a lot of I like to point out that, although they're down for the previous year, the local dealer association is
still predicting new auto sales of 111,000 vehicles for the year, which is a very high number for Puerto Rico. And
we had – and June was our highest month of originations in history for our auto and lease financing. So we
continue to see strong demand for auto in Puerto Rico. Obviously, the supply chain issue is an issue here as it is
in many places in the states, but we still see a very healthy market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. That's helpful color. And then wanted to make sure I understood the decline in the asset sensitivity of the
balance sheet. It seem – would seem to me like the margin, and appreciate the $2 million guidance for 25 basis
points, but it would seem to me like the margin would continue to move upward, I'm not sure if I fully understand
how it's becoming – and the balance sheet is becoming neutral in terms of interest rate sensitivity. And I was
hoping maybe you could give us some color on deposit basis from here and what's making the balance sheet
more neutral?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Well, a couple of things are affecting it. One, we're putting a lot of the immediately re-pricing assets to work, right.
We're extending some of our cash into the investment portfolio. And more importantly, we're now also extending
the cash into the loan portfolio, which is what we prefer to do. So with that we'll naturally reduce our asset
sensitivity. The other factor that affects this is, as I mentioned – as you know, government deposits in Puerto
Rico, which is a big chunk of our deposit book is market-linked, but it's not necessarily market linked
instantaneously, it is market-linked with their lag. So we have not seen that market linkage evident yet this early in
our course of the process.
But it will become more evident in the next three months or so in the next four months to the point where they will
become fully market-linked, meaning that we will have a live – used up the lag in re-pricing at some point in time
and that will re-price or move to re-pricing a big chunk of our deposit book on a market-linked basis. We will
continue to be able to earn a nice margin on those deposits. So they will still be accretive, but that margin will not
continue to increase as it may increase for deposits that are not linked to market. So I think that's probably the
other two, the two biggest drivers, Brett.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. That's helpful, Carlos. And then just lastly, if I heard it right, $444 million of expense quarterly guidance in
the back half of the year, was curious how much of that might be the stock-based incentive compensation versus
other pieces?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Sure. Let me walk for you through that. As we have quarterly expenses of $415 million, our quarterly expenses
tend to be seasonal so they usually tend to be lower in the second – first two quarters of the year and higher in
the second two quarters of the year. So – and that's what happened this quarter, we're running lower than our
guidance of $415 million, which means by definition that the last two quarters of the year we're going to be higher
9


Popular, Inc.
(BPOP) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
anyway for us to hit that $415 million. So that is somewhat what's happening is just the normal seasonality in our
expenses.
The change here is – with the first thing you mentioned that we now believe, given our performance year-to-date,
that the profit sharing payment will be triggered. So we have added that to our outlook. That is normally not part of
our outlook because we don't assume profit sharing will be triggered. We have to actually perform for that to
happen and that will add something that looks like $30 million to the outlook. And the other piece of that, that
addresses the increase is where Ignacio mentioned and I mentioned of the review of compensation of Popular
that we've done a very comprehensive review of compensation that ended up increasing compensation expenses
for something that looks like in the ballpark of $7 million a quarter or something like that, that will be fully effective
starting on this quarter and the third quarter of the year and moving forward.
And the combination of those two things are what explains the delta between this $415 million and the new
average part of the expenses of $425 million. So the average quarterly expenses are going up by $10 million, but
the nominal expenses in the last two quarters will be up by a higher number. But it's just math, obviously they –
we've gone up anyway even if those two – these last two events I mentioned has not happened.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
No, reduction to $10 million, okay. And then you had made a comment that a component of the increased spend
was to fund compliance, fraud, cybersecurity type initiatives. Is there any anything specific that kind of drove that
narrative? Or is that just the cost of doing business and economic activity continues to ramp higher? You need to
ramp those initiatives of to kind of keep pace?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Your explanations were as good as mine were going to be. Yes, it is. The cost of doing business, I mean, the
regulatory environment, as you know is not getting any more complacent or any more flexible number one. And
number two, we simply have more clients doing more transactions with us, which means that it's going to be more
events, it's going to be more alerts, it's going to be more fraud alerts that need to be investigated, it's going to be
more chances of more clients that cybercriminals can try to use their credentials to get into our systems. So the
growth of the business is the other part that's driving it. So your explanation was on point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q

Okay. And then just lastly, on expenses, what does that assume as far as OREO outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A

No, it assumes OREO is at breakeven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

OREO is breakeven. Okay, great. And then just on the remaining Evertec transactions, the sell down to 4.5% that
– gain that's going to be returned to shareholders. Is that a 2022 event? Is that happened in the fourth quarter? Or
does that need to go through the same type of capital plan and that should be included kind of incremental in the
2023 plan?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
No, I mean, it depends – I mean, we'll make the decision whether we want to go or not go, depending on what's
happening with the market, first of all. And that is the first part of what has to happen, which is for us to actually

sell the shares. Once we have sold the shares, then we need regulatory approval to actually do the additional –
redeploy those gains as a buyback. And the regulatory approval takes the time that it takes. I think there is – and
whether all that can happen in this quarter, I don't know, it's probably, unlikely. So more than not it looks like
something that's probably more of a fourth quarter event.

Okay. And then just lastly, just following up on the government deposit, is it lag that you referenced – is that a lag
on hikes or just a lag on timing when those hikes are passed along to the customer? And maybe if you could just
talk through kind of how long that lag is and any kind of color you can provide on the beta that you're expecting
there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, it's just the way the formula works and how we reflect market rates on the rate that applies to the
customers. So again, there, again, your comment was correct and it applies over time. And the lag is something
that looks like three months or something in that ballpark [indiscernible] (00:38:03-00:38:10). It also gradually will
average into a through a period of about three months.

Can you guys share with us is obviously a number of crosscurrents going on in the economy today, as we saw
with the real GDP trend this morning. And one of the concerns or one of the topics of conversation is end of cycle
loan growth and the industry like you folks as well. So good loan growth this quarter. Can you somehow give us
some color or reassurances that a year from now we're not going to be looking back and seeing maybe some
13

regrets that the loan growth was too strong in early part of 2022 when the evidence, again crosscurrents and the
economy is starting to show maybe a slowdown?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Well, yeah, I think we feel very confident that we as opposed perhaps other people, we have never really relaxed
our credit standards. So really the growth, they were coming from where being continuing to be, I think, very
prudent and very disciplined. It's just the economy, especially here in Puerto Rico is strong. And we're starting to
see economic activity, which we haven't seen for a long time, and a lot of pent-up demand. But we really never
relax our underwriting standards to try and create that loan growth sort of artificially.
So we feel we're very well positioned, as Lidio has mentioned various times the industries we're in, we think our
industries that will withstand some deceleration of growth as well. Our FICO scores in the consumer book are
strong. So again, we're looking out for these is tailwinds that everyone knows and possibly out there. But I'm not
very concerned, I mean, we have not done anything that would lead us to believe we – we're unduly relaxed and
now we have to attack and I think we've been very consistent. And the longer we see it, just a reflection of the
pent-up demand and economic growth especially in Puerto Rico.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
The other thing to consider with your question, Gerard is, is the concept of end of cycle. There is a number of very
well respected local economies here in Puerto Rico that believe that the idiosyncratic things are effecting Puerto
Rico economy, which this time tend to be in our favor actually versus the last 10 years that were against us,
meaning that, of the effect of all the federal saw an expansion.
But also the fact that we have the extra lever of hurricane assistance that the rest of the country doesn't have, that
differential could mean that Puerto Rico may perform slightly better than the national average moving forward. So
some of the local economists believe that there's a reasonable chance that even if the US goes into recession as
long as that recession is short and shallow, that it may just be that Puerto Rico never gets into recession because
of the positive effects of that investment. So we'll have to see. Of course, it depends on, if there is a recession in
the US and how long and how deep it is. But there is a perception that we may perform slightly better in the
island, and that is we haven't been able to say that for about 12 years, 13 years now. So, hopefully, we work on
the chance that we actually have a possibility of performing slightly better than the US economy for once.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up to that, are you seeing any new entrants into the market for lending mainly in
banks that may be coming in that weren't there 12 months ago?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Not really. I think we have seen some of the bigger banks that JPMorgan's of the world and the Goldman Sachs
being interested in some of these big transactions that they are hopeful will happen sort of like perhaps the
privatization of the boards, which is ongoing and things like that. I haven't seen any new activity of US players.
Some of the local players like when Banesco got a lot of money from that statute that benefited minority
institutions, which they'll be a little bit more aggressive in the small and medium size. But they're very small

institution, but not really I mean, they've always been adherent in certain deals, but nothing unusual other than I
do think you're seeing more of the people that do project finance being interested in Puerto Rico.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Keep in mind that for large commercial transactions, Gerard, we have always competed with mainland banks –
and mainland pension funds and mainland hedge funds for fund -to fund them. So it's actually – it's not a lot of
delta from how we've done business all the time. Any transaction that is significant, large or is or the underlying
client is a US-based client, we have to compete with US banks for them anyway.

And are you in Puerto Rico seeing the used car price inflation similar to what we've seen in the States, which may

Ignacio Alvarez A

...what we've seen, but definitely, clarify used car prices have gone up in Puerto Rico? So obviously, we're
maintaining our discipline regarding again, I said our underwriting standards. We are not – we're very happy with
the originations we're getting with our existing underwriting standards. So we haven't found a necessity to lower
that. Keep in mind that one of the things that is a bit of an offset in Puerto Rico, that we're very – we have very
high taxes on cars, especially new cars. So that helps a little bit the used car because when you go buy a new
car, you have to pay a very high, we call [indiscernible] (00:46:49) tax. And therefore used car market still has a
little bit of a cushion in that sense in Puerto Rico, but we're watching it.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Well, first of all, can you just maybe help us get a sense for the ebbs and flows in the government deposits now
that we're out of bankruptcy? Sort of the expectation there – the seasonality there that gets you back to that 11%
to 15% range by the end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I think Carlos talked about it more, but we put out estimates usually based on our conversations
with the Treasury Department and what their estimates are. And it's been – they've been all over the place. On
the positive side, the economy in Puerto Rico's done better. So they have generated a lot more tax revenues that
they were anticipating. On the expense side, well, there are some funds that we estimate around maybe $2 billion
that are COVID related funds that are classified in public funds that have been sold to be dispersed. And we
would have anticipated maybe that they would have anticipated.
So the ebbs and flows traditionally and we live in a very unique world now with pandemic and all these funds is
the taxes come in in April and then they pay the bonds in July. July 1st is their principal payment. Those are the
big ebbs and flows. But – and with the pandemic, we've had big inflows of money for COVID relief and other
situations. So it's very hard for the government to predict and we sort of rely on them to predict the flows. But over
time those COVID funds have to be spent or we're going to lose them, for example, so that – they'll have to go
out. And I think the government will have a better idea. Again, we haven't been out of bankruptcy for that long. So
they're trying to stabilize their finances. But I don't know Carlos you want to add anything to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
We have been, we have been very consistent on our forecasts of government policies by being wrong every
quarter, nine quarters were like that. So again, it's not a lack of trying. It is, as Ignacio said, it is everything we
communicate is our best guess, given all the information we have from our clients. Remember, the balance is not
a single client to this. There's hundreds of clients in there as well. So it's our best guess given the information. But
sometimes the clients themselves don't have as good information as they think. The tax revenues being much
higher this year is a good example of that. So our best guess, given all the – all that we know today, is that, again,
we'll be back to the range that we expected by year end. I have no idea whether the agreement that was
announced today for some climate legislation will have money attached to it. And whether some of that money will
come to us, and we'll change the forecast. So there's all kinds of things like that affect us. So it's our best
informed estimate given everything we know as of today. But again, we've missed it a few times.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And then, I mean, I guess sort of a corollary or a following question to that is, how do you think about your
normalized level of liquidity? Obviously, you got this chunk of deposits that could be anything in any given quarter.
But how much of that can actually be invested in a way that either into loan growth or into longer duration
securities that you feel comfortable?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Well, the – it's easier to focus on the government deposits because they are the biggest chunk in the deposit
book. But I think the answer to your question is a more holistic answer and what's going to happen with the
deposit flows moving forward. We fully expect that commercial deposits, you've seen already – in most banks in
the Mainland, you've seen deposits go down already. So, we're a little bit of an outlier that we had deposits going
down in this quarter.
I think in the commercial front, you will probably see a lot of pressure on deposits moving forward. I mean, the
deposit outflows, as our commercial clients had that have active treasury activities will look for a better yields on
their liquidity. So, the commercial sector might actually see some outflows moving forward. We haven't seen it yet,
but that might be coming. I think that's going to be much slower in the retail side. The retail side tends to respond
less quickly, while some high net worth clients may move some deposits to higher yielding at alternatives. I think
the majority of clients will move slowly even to changing the retail clients move slowly.
So, the big two pieces are going to be what ends up happening with commercial, which, again, we shouldn't
ignore it. You've seen deposits – commercial deposits coming down in many banks in the Mainland already. And
then the government, if we happen to be correct this time in our bonds prediction, then they'll probably be down
between $2 billion, $4 billion, $5 billion by year-end.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Are you able to breakout the idea portion of your deposits that you consider to be not super sensitive to
rates, the retail or the stuff that's not going to have that DAC and Treasury management?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Well, the most of it – the rate is the government deposits and again with a lag, but that's going to move in tandem
to market. So again, keep in mind, as I mentioned earlier, we do earn a margin on that the difference. So three
months from now is that margin will not continue to increase, it will stay in the – it has increased for the last couple
of months, but it will not continue to increase once we reach that point where the deposits are pegged to market
changes in the market. So again, they'll still be accretive. We'll make we have a margin on it, but the margin will
get capped when the linkages is fully in place.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. I mean, when I think about the rate sensitivity and sort of the change in the guide this quarter, I mean,
there's another way to think about it just relative to last quarter that you just pulled forward. I'm calculating around
five rate hikes by deploying a $1.5 billion into health maturity securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, we think, if there is increasing rate, right. So the question of whether you do about it, if you're a
bank, you try to capture that, that those higher rates into a balance sheet. And we've done quite a bit of that by
extending the bond portfolio and more importantly now also growing the loan portfolio. So we've taken the action
that we think makes sense to capture that increased margin moving forward. But you can't do it twice right? Once
you did it, you've done it. So that because they've said they'll be moving forward. And so I think the description is
accurate, Alex, that is part of what has happened already, yes.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. And then, if I remember correctly, part of the Evertec transaction was actually to recognize some
revenue shares as well. And I couldn't remember if that was something that was going to take impact this year or
if as a 2023 event, maybe you can just remind us kind of on the fee side, how Evertec is going to impact the
complexion of the fee income in your guide for the next two quarters as well as how that's going to change next
year with that revenue share component?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah, it impacts the results immediately. But the flip side of that is, is by reducing our equity stake, we also give
up equity investments through the equity income, income that also comes in to that line. So you don't see the
change in the line. Alex, but yeah, there's is a plus and minus they happen to be about the same size here,
obviously part of the logic behind the transaction is that we don't think they'll stay the same size and we think that
the revenue linked – the fees linked to the to the merchant business will actually outpace in growth. The other
side of the equation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then just a final question for me. Just back to the margin and the new loan yields that you're
getting today. Loan yields in Puerto Rico seem to be a decent margin above US yields or these have been when
rates were zero, are you seeing loan betas or how is higher rates actually impacted new origination yields on
commercial product?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Well, we've seen overall loan yields go up by eight basis points in the quarter. So we are trying to reflect the
change in rates into our origination. Now, the going yields, it's also depends on mix of number, other things,
obviously. But we are trying to reflect and new market conditions are in loan yield. The new origination will change
the loan yield slowly, though, because, again, we have a big base portfolio, so they've really made changes, the
loan will yield only on the margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
But Alex, if your question is more directed, have these increases saw a decreased demand for commercial loans?
We haven't seen that yet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. But you are getting if you were – if a commercial loan was had a five handle, 1.5 year ago, is it coming on
today with still a five handle or is it coming on today with the seven handle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

It must have been asked and answered, but I did want to – now that you have Evertec closed, that's a question
about what you're doing on the technology investment side. One of the strategic rationales for the deal was the
flexibility it opens up. Can you talk about some of the things you look to do now that you have that deal closed?
And I think you cited increased tax spend as one of the areas of increase for expenses. So if that was within what
you had been planning to do or if there's new projects on board that weren't previously in the guidance before.

Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I'm not sure in terms of which projects are – were in the guidance or not. Definitely by taking these client facing
platforms, take them over and bring them back in. We now see we have greater ability to work on things that we
had before. We – in general, we're looking to do is improve the origination process – the digital origination
process, both on the consumer and on the commercial front that's something we work on.
We're also going to be spending some money on our cash management systems, which we think we need to
upgrade this, remain competitive. So some of the big projects we're working on there. So I don't think that the
Evertec transaction as such has increased our spending. What it has, it has allowed us to have greater flexibility
to look at things that we wanted to do anyway and do them. So I don't know, Carlos, you want to add any color
there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, we may have most of the stuff around and it having closer transactions gives us the possibility of
maybe choosing to do some of the things we hadn't planned a bit quicker. But again, we've only closed the
transaction for a month now, so you have to be able to have more time to put more numbers around that. So but it
is a possibility that things that we thought might take might we may start in a 1.5 years or 2 years. We may now
have the possibility or the option to start a bit faster or we'll make change around things when we want to do
things. So we may move big projects perhaps and have spent on X and do it later and then move for appraise to
have a spend of 0.5x or 2x. So but that is still early days in the process.

Got it. Thanks, so much. And then I do appreciate all the color on the puts and takes of expenses in the second
half of the year, and kind of the noise around the hire from for profit sharing as you get out from, from that. How
should we be thinking about what a normalized run rate looks like now that you took a step up on employee
expenses and everything like that as we move past the second half of the year?

Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
It's an excellent question, and we don't have the answer to that question yet. So we gave you what we can, I
think, get our arms around with some degree of confidence, which is the next two quarters. We will provide you
and the market with new average quarterly expense guidance for 2023 in our webcast in January of next year.
We're not trying to be evasive or cute about this. What ends up driving our expense guidance is all the projects
and efforts that we decide to embark on next year. That is a result of our budgeting and planning process and that
process really goes on into sometime in late November. So we will actually not know the number until we decide
which projects we're going to do or pursue and which ones we're not, and things of that sort that will decide later
this year. So I don't have the number yet. We will give you guidance in January for a full 2023.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Thank you.

Operator: Thank you, Kelly. We now have a follow-up question from Timur with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. Maybe just adding on to Kelly's question and asking it a little different. Are you
expecting kind of this $245 million range for both third quarter and fourth quarter? Or is that kind of ramping up
towards the fourth quarter? And how are you thinking about kind of the fourth quarter exit rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, it could move around a little bit within the two quarters, our best guess is that the quarters will look
very similar at $445 million, Timur. But it could be that it's $440 million or $450 million or $450 million and $440
million or something like that. It depends on when some things get going and get paid and that sort of stuff. So we
have a reasonable degree of confidence on the average for both quarters. If you actually wanted to pin it down to
one quarter the other, I have a lesser degree of confidence on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And is there an expectation that an earnings credit rate is a component of the higher expense based? And
then maybe if you can just provide any color on what component of the public funds will see higher rates through
ECR versus just higher deposit costs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, some of – it is valid question, so not all of the cost shows up through dangerous expense line.
Some of the cost is in the fee section. We have never broken it up that way. It also will depend how they use. How
many services they use from us, right. That's part of the equation that goes in. If they contract new services and
then the mix between what goes into expense line and what goes into fee portion of the changes. I don't have the
number. Well, we'll try to figure out if it's something we can do, something that makes sense on that. But I don't
have a number on top of my head.
