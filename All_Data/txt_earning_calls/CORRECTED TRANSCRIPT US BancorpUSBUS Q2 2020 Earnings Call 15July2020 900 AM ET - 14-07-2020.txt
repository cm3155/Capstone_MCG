Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and
uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page
2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.
I'll now turn the call over to Andy.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry,
Jodi, Mark and I will take any questions you have.
I'll begin on Slide 3. In the second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.41. Consistent with the industry,
our performance is being impacted by the current economic environment. Loan growth reflected the impact of
defensive draws by corporations in March and early April, strong mortgage loan growth, and the impact of the
Paycheck Protection Program, which supported small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 situation.
Increased liquidity in the financial system and a flight to quality drove strong deposit growth in the quarter. Our
healthy fee income growth this quarter is a testament to our diversified business model. Some fee lines, including
our payments businesses, were negatively impacted by slower economic activity.
However, we saw very strong growth in our mortgage and commercial products businesses. And while consumer
spend activity remains pressured compared with a year ago, volume trends in each of our payments businesses
have improved as some economies have started to reopen. Expenses were held relatively flat compared with the
first quarter. We continue to manage our cost structure prudently and in line with the slower revenue growth
environment.
Credit quality metrics in the second quarter reflected increased economic stress, offset by the beneficial impact of
government stimulus and forbearance and deferral programs. During the quarter, we increased our allowance for
loan losses in response to economic conditions.
We believe our reserve level at June 30 is appropriate based on the information we have available. Changes in
the allowance will be dependent on actual credit performance and changes in economic conditions. In the lower
right quadrant of this slide, you can see that book value per share grew 2.8% compared with a year ago, and we
remain well capitalized.
Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. We delivered a 7.1% return on tangible common equity in the second
quarter, impacted by lower earnings owing to the current economic environment.
Slide 5 shows our continually improving digital uptake trends. Shelter-in-place orders early in the quarter and
temporary branch closures due to the COVID-19 have increased an increase in digital adoptions. Digital now
accounts for more than three-quarters of all service transactions and about 46% of all loan sales. We expect
digital adoption by customers to stick even after the economy fully reopens.
Now let me turn over to Terry who'll provide more color on the quarter.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Thanks, Andy. If you turn to slide 6, I'll start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of the second
quarter earnings trends. Average loans grew 6.9% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 10.0% year-over-year.
Growth includes $7.3 billion of loans made under the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program during the second
quarter.
The average loan size to these small businesses was approximately $73,000. Excluding the impact of PPP,
average loans grew 5.4% on a linked-quarter basis and 8.5% year-over-year. Excluding PPP, linked-quarter
growth was primarily driven by growth in commercial loans and in mortgage loans.
In late first quarter, business customers drew down their lines to support business activity and future liquidity
requirements. We started to see paydowns of commercial loans in May and the paydown activity accelerated in
June as many customers accessed the capital markets.
As of last week, about two-thirds of the defensive draws we saw in the late first quarter and early second quarter
have been repaid. Strong residential mortgage growth reflected the low interest rate environment. Credit card
balances declined in the quarter due to lower spend activity.
Turning to slide 7, average deposits increased 11.2% on a linked-quarter basis and grew 16.8% year-over-year.
Average non-interest-bearing deposits increased 30.1% year-over-year, driven by corporate and commercial
banking, consumer and business banking and wealth management and investment services.
Turning to slide 8, while the net charge-off ratio was relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis, non-performing
assets increased 24% sequentially, reflecting increased economic stress. The non-performing assets to loans
plus other real estate owned ratio totaled 0.38% at June 30, compared with 0.30% at March 31. We have taken a
proactive approach in evaluating credit quality across the entire commercial loan portfolio and considered risk
rating changes in the evaluation of our allowance for credit losses.
Our loan loss provision was $1.7 billion in the second quarter, inclusive of $437 million of net charge-offs and a
reserve build of $1.3 billion. The increase in the reserve was related to changes in risk ratings and deterioration in
economic conditions, driven by the impact of COVID-19 on the US and global economies, and our expectation
that credit losses and non-performing assets will increase from current levels.
The increase in the allowance for credit loss is considered our best estimate of the impact of slower economic
growth and elevated unemployment, partially offset by the benefits of government stimulus programs as of June
30. While estimates are based on many quantitative factors and qualitative judgments, our base case outlook
assumes an unemployment rate of 13% to 14% for the second quarter, declining to 9.0% in the fourth quarter of
2020 and to 7.8% by the fourth quarter of 2021.
Slide 9 highlights our key underwriting metrics and exposures to certain at-risk segments given the current
environment. We have a strong relationship-based credit culture at U.S. Bank supported by cash flow-based
lending that considers sensitivity to stress, proactive management and portfolio diversification, which allows us to
support growth throughout the economic cycle and produces consistent results.
Slide 10 provides an earnings summary. In the second quarter of 2020, we reported $0.41 per share. These
results were adversely affected by the current economic environment and the related impact to consumer and
business spend and the expected increases in credit losses.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Turning to slide 11. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.2 billion was essentially flat
compared with the first quarter, in line with our expectations, as the impact of lower interest rates was partially
offset by deposit and funding mix and loan growth. Also, as expected, the net interest margin declined by 29 basis
points compared with the first quarter. The lower margin reflected lower rates and a flatter yield curve as well as
higher cash balance being maintained for liquidity to accommodate customer demand. While loan mix put
pressure on the net interest margin, the earning asset impact was mostly offset by beneficial shifts in deposit and
funding mix.
Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income. Strength in mortgage banking and commercial product revenue
more than offset declines in the payment revenues. Mortgage banking revenue benefited from higher mortgage
production and stronger gain on sale margins partially offset by the net impact of change in fair value of mortgage
servicing rights and related hedging activity. Commercial product revenue reflected higher corporate bond
issuance fees and trading revenue.
Slide 13 provides information about our payment services businesses, including exposures to impacted
industries. Payments revenues was pressured by the impact of COVID-related shutdowns and reduced economic
activity in the quarter. However, consumer sales trends improved throughout the quarter, and that trajectory has
continued in early July.
Credit and debit card revenue declined 22.2% year-over-year and merchant processing services revenue
declined 34.2% year-over-year. Both categories performing somewhat better than what we had expected.
Corporate payment products revenue declined 39.5% year-over-year, in line with our expectations as business
spending continues to reflect cautious sentiment.
Turning to slide 14, non-interest expense was essentially flat on a linked-quarter basis, in line with our
expectations. Second quarter expense reflected an increase in revenue related costs from mortgage and capital
markets production and expense related to COVID-19 situation.
During the quarter, we incurred incremental COVID-19 related costs of approximately $66 million. These
expenses consisted of about $30 million related to increasing liabilities for potential future delivery claims related
to the airline industry and other merchants, and about $50 million related to premium pay for frontline workers and
costs tied to providing a safe working environment for our employees. We expect these incremental COVID
expenses to begin to dissipate in the second half of the year.
Slide 15 highlights our capital position. At June 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, calculated in
accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the current expected credit loss
methodology implementation, was 9.0% at June 30. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio reflecting the full
implementation of the current expected credit loss accounting methodology was 8.7%.
I'll now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the third quarter of 2020, we expect fully taxable equivalent
net interest income to be relatively flat compared to the second quarter. We expect mortgage revenue to continue
to be strong on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, but it is likely to decline compared with the second
quarter, reflecting slower refinancing activity for the industry.
Payments revenue is likely to be adversely affected through the remainder of the year on a year-over-year basis,
due to reduced consumer and business spending activity. However, we expect continued gradual improvement in
sales volumes. We expect non-interest expenses to be relatively stable compared with the second quarter.

Future levels of reserve build will depend on a number of factors, including changes in the outlook for credit
quality, reflecting both economic conditions and portfolio performance and any beneficial offset from government
stimulus. We will continue to assess the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses as credit conditions change.
For the full year 2020, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 15%.
I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Terry. I'll end my remarks on slide 16, which highlights a few of the recent actions we've taken as a
company to help support our customers, communities and employees.
We are operating in uncertain times, not only for the economy, but for society in general. However, I am confident
that together we can make lasting and impactful changes that will leave us all better on the other side of these
trying times. We are well-positioned for near-term challenges and we continue to manage this company with a
long-term lens, and focus on maximizing shareholder value. Our capital and liquidity positions are strong, and our
unique business model remains a differentiator for us.
I would highlight three things that we will continue to support our ability to deliver industry-leading returns through
the cycle. First, as our second quarter results indicate, our diversified business mix reduces revenue and earnings
volatility. And this quarter, it allowed us to deliver good revenue growth even against a challenging interest rate
backdrop and an industry-wide slowdown in consumer spending activity.
Second, our time-tested credit underwriting discipline puts us in a strong position to navigate through an
economic downturn while setting us up to return to prudent and consistent growth in the more favorable economic
environment.
And third, our culture remains the foundation, which informs not only what we do at U.S. Bank, but how we do it. I
couldn't be more proud of our employees who've come together to support our customers and communities, and
they face significant economic and social disruption. I want to take this opportunity to thank them for all their hard
work and resiliency.
We will now open up the call for Q&A.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Hey, thank you for taking the question. Let's see, I guess, Terry a question for you just on –
you gave the NII expectation for the third quarter. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the sort of, the puts
and takes, meaning balance sheet growth and where you'd see the margin trajecting from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yes. From a loan perspective, again, we would expect that we'll see year-over-year growth, but on a linked-
quarter basis, clearly, it's going to be down. We're going to continue to see paydowns associated with those
defensive draws that we had at the end of the first quarter and early second quarter. So that will put downward
pressure on a linked-quarter basis.
PPP will actually probably help from a growth standpoint as we think about second quarter. But it does start to
dissipate in third and fourth quarter, simply because it's a loan forgiveness program. So, on the consumer side,
auto lending has generally been a little bit – it was weak in April and May, but it's gotten stronger in June. So we
believe that that's going to be a bright spot as we think about the third quarter. But overall, consumer lending is
likely to be down simply because consumer spending has been down. So that's kind of the puts and takes if you
think about loan growth.
Margin, we believe, is going to be relatively stable. It will be helped a little bit by PPP, but impacted a little bit –
there'll be a little bit of pressure on the yield curve side of the equation, but relatively stable to the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, just given the absolute level of interest rates, do fee waivers start to become
an issue in the money market area. And if I recall correctly from the last time rates were this low, I think those
show up in trust fees. If they're sort of something you guys are thinking about, where would they show up, and
what's kind of the impact you guys would see?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think the impact would be probably similar to what we saw last time, given – but maybe a little bit more
simply because of the growth. But we'll show it in trust and investment management fees, because that's where
our money market fund revenue gets recognized.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Matt.

Good morning.

Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Just to clarify on the net interest income outlook of stable quarter-to-quarter. Does that include some of the kind of
benefit from PPP repaying or forbearing? And if so, what are your assumptions on that in terms of the next couple
of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So it includes all of the puts and takes. Like I said, it will reflect a decline on a linked-quarter basis in terms
of commercial loans because of the draws, but there will be some benefit associated with PPP. So it includes
essentially all the puts and takes associated with net interest income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then, I am wondering on the PPP, it seems like your kind of approach was more granular or to go after
kind of smaller – really, the small-small businesses, if I just look at your total amount funded versus applications.
And just wondering if you could talk to that approach and maybe give us some insight in terms of the cost that
you've incurred to originate those loans.

Matt, this is Andy. We took the applications as they came in, serving our customers initially and then ultimately
outside of the bank. As you saw, we had over 101,000 applications and the average balance was in the $70,000.
So a lot of our customers are small business and we helped a lot of employees.
So the team did a great job. We started with a bit of a manual process and went to a much more automated
process, certainly in the second round. So it was just based on the request that came in and the priority was really
time based.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q

another.

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. I wanted to drill down a little bit on your comments, Terry, on the payments business and sort
of a gradual improvement there. I guess first of all, could you just give us a little bit of a sense for how much the
consumer recovered. And then seemed like in June, the year-on-year declines in acquiring volumes and the
current volumes has really, really lessened. But can you just give us a sense of what, say, the exit rates were in
terms of volumes in those categories in June versus March.
And I guess as an adjunct to that, why wouldn't that suggest that, at least sequentially, you should see pretty
sharp improvements, in terms of the sequential growth in issuing and acquiring revenue versus release versus the

second quarter; obviously year-on-year's tough, but versus the second quarter, which seem to suggest that you
could see a nice improvement sequentially. And I just wanted to get your sense as to whether I'm thinking about
that right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Saul, I think you're right on. I think when we end up looking at our payments business on a sequential
basis, we will see growth, particularly in the credit card and the merchant. The corporate payments, we would also
expect growth but maybe not at the same level simply because sales volumes there – our commercial spend – or
commercial customers are still fairly cautious.
But to kind of give you some perspective, at the end of – or in April, we saw on the merchant side of the equation,
consumer spend was down almost between 50%, 55% kind of in that ballpark. And today, it's really back to –
spend levels are closer to about 20%. So that has come back really very nicely. The things that are going to
continue to impact for a while is the mix associated with the airline industry and some of the entertainment, but it
has come back very nicely, so your point on sequential growth is right on.
With respect to credit card, credit card, we had said, was down kind of in that 30% range in April. And that has
come back nicely as well. In terms of credit card, it is still down. It's down around 10% to 12%. We would expect
that trajectory to continue, Saul, into third quarter.
Debit card revenue – or sales, excuse me, actually have been pretty strong and the sales on the debit card side
has been kind of up 10% to 12% kind of in that range. And while we wouldn't expect it to be maybe quite at that
higher level in the third quarter, it is still, I think, going to be relatively strong.
And then on the CPS side of the equation, CPS, again, the commercial spend has been pretty cautious. It was
down kind of in the magnitude of 30% to 35% in that April sort of timeframe. And it's still down around –
somewhere between 25% and 30%. We do expect it to get a little better than that in the third quarter, for a couple
of reasons, simply because government spend tends to be strongest in the third quarter. So hopefully, that gives
you some insights or perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yes. No, that's super helpful. If I could squeeze another one in on fees, the deposit service charge is obviously
down a lot. And you commented about fee waivers related with COVID. I mean how do we think about that going
forward? And I don't know if you can quantify that or just give us a sense of how that, I think, $133 million, how
that could compare to maybe a more normalized level in the coming quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Similar sort of impacts as consumer spend and just activity has declined. And then you have the stimulus
checks and all sorts of [ph] erudite (23:44) things, just incidence levels related to NSF, and fee waivers in terms of
helping our customers has impacted the second quarter.
On a sequential basis, we would expect that will come back nicely in the third quarter. But on a year-over-year
basis, it's still going to be down simply because consumer activity is down, similar to merchant or credit card.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Erika.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
My first question is on the reserve. And this is a question that all your peers have been getting during this
earnings season. So I always like to think in the CECL world that your reserve to loan ratio of 2.54% represents a
cumulative loss rate for the recession that represents, let's say, two years. And I guess the question here is that,
is that your view? I guess it's another way of asking, are you done in terms of reserve building?
And related to that, your peers have also talked about the base case, but that the base case tends to be one of,
let's say, five or so different scenarios, and those scenarios are weighted. And so I'm wondering if you could give
us some insight in terms of as you had built your reserve, how much weight that base case was taken into
account versus perhaps other scenarios?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So let me take the first question. And when we think about the reserving, you're absolutely right. You make
your estimates at the end of any particular quarter based upon the information that you have available at that
particular point in time. And certainly at June 30, we believe that the reserve is appropriate for the cumulative
losses that are there.

So we wouldn't expect future increases in the reserve. But again, that is going to be highly dependent upon what
changes either in terms of economic factors or if our credit quality changes differently than what we had expected.
So the important thing is that we're going to continue to assess the reserve every quarter based upon the
information that we have available to us. But you are right, theoretically, that is how CECL works, and that's how
we're trying to apply it.
Coming to your second question, the information that I ended up giving to you with respect to unemployment –
now keep in mind, unemployment is an important factor but there's like 200 different multiples that are a part of
the modeling process. So it's pretty complex. Because you've got a lot of different types of portfolios, et cetera.
But unemployment, the information I gave you was really the weighted average across many different multiple
scenarios that we ended up looking at. So you are right, when we look at this, we look at information from many
sources in terms of things like unemployment, GDP, et cetera, et cetera.
We develop a base case, if you will, but then we look at multiple scenarios around that base case and weight it.
But the information that I gave you was weighted based upon those multiples. So it should give you some
comparability when you think about that. Andy, have you anything to add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
No, you've said it well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And my follow-up question is to Andy. Sorry, Andy, I think what was particularly impressive about this
quarter is your PPNR resiliency and obviously, the forward look would imply that this will continue. And Terry just
told us that we could be done in terms of reserve building. As we think about the future and as we think about a
more difficult operating environment for banks, how are you thinking about inorganic growth strategies from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Well, Erica, first, as you mentioned, I think our diversified revenue mix helps a lot and this quarter probably
represented it very well. We had some pressure on payments because of the spend activity that Terry talked
about. But mortgage and commercial products had a – it hit it out of the park this quarter in terms of positives.
And then the other part of our diversification is how much of our revenue comes from the balance sheet or net
interest income as well as fee revenue sort of a mix stack 50/50 there. So, that really helps in environments like
this, and different businesses do well in different economic cycles.
As we think about the future, I think we are planning for a future that has continued low rates. It will take a while
for spend to get back to normal. So we're going to manage our expenses with that thought in mind, which is what
we're doing today. And we're going to continue to invest in the businesses that have opportunity as well as the
digital initiatives that I talked about. And those digital initiatives will offer not only the opportunity for our customers
to connect with us in a virtual means, I think it will also offer expense opportunities in the long run. So, those are
the ways we're thinking about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And just any thoughts on inorganic strategies, acquisitions, I guess to say it more bluntly.

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Thanks for being blunt. So we will look at opportunities that come up. The only thing I'd say is, in this
environment, Erika, there's a lot of uncertainty. And it's certainly not a clear vision in terms of the future, even for
us. So to look at someone else with that lens will be challenging. But I do think opportunities will come up
because of the stresses that are out there, and we'll take a look.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I want to challenge your – look, you're one of the most conservative banks, but I want to challenge some of
your conservatism. So on your base case, again, 9% unemployment by the end of this year. I know it's a lot of
scenarios, and it's weighted average and all that, but at least one of your peers was more conservative than that.
And I know that's the Fed base case, so there's nothing crazy about it. It's just I thought why not be more
conservative if you have the flexibility or when you take the weighted average of the different scenarios – I'm
pushing back a little bit where like this seems like peak reserve builds, and you said that, but if your economic
assumptions are wrong then that won't be the case. So why not be more conservative there?
And along those lines, your payments comment that it should improve sequentially, kind of makes sense. But
look, we just had a big increase in COVID cases, which leads to more deaths, which leads to some closing down.
And how are you feeling about that progression?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So maybe to address the first question, when you end up establishing the reserve, you have to establish
what you believe is appropriate based upon the information which we have available to us. And we use things like
Moody's Analytics and other sources in order to kind of come up with that projection of what unemployment, as an
example, looks like. So you have to make sure that your reserve is appropriate based upon the information that
you have. You can't build in tons of conservatism, so to speak, into it. But again, part of it is we'll have to, kind of,
wait and see.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
On the payments side of the equation in terms of COVID cases, based upon our estimates right now, I think that
this go around versus last go around, I think that states are continuing to try to stay open to the best that they can.
I think you have different health treatments and all sorts of different things that exist based upon better information
or different information than what existed before. But quite honestly, we're going to find out. There's a lot of
uncertainty and it's too early to know.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. And I'd add on. Mike, I think you're right. Things are changing every day and the facts change daily,
weekly, sometimes hourly. So, we're just going to continue to assess and manage the company, given the
changes that are out there. What Terry is telling you what he is seeing right now, and as he said, we get data
every day, and we're going to continue to assess what we think is going to happen. We're running a lot of models.
We're sharing with our Board a lot of scenarios, including a much harsher scenario and understanding what would
occur in that. But you're right. I mean, there's a lot of unknown yet, and we are being conservative in the way
we're approaching our financial modeling.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then one follow-up question. Look, your third slide of substance, it's slide number 5, but the digital
engagement trends, I mean you're certainly putting that front and center. Can you bring us up to date, like as of
like to the moment, of what's happening with your digital engagement?
And what does that mean in terms of branches and national expansion and anything else? Because if you're
putting this as your third slide in your earnings deck, it's clearly -- I know it's always been important, but it seems
like now it's being put on steroids in terms of the way you're highlighting this, which must mean some bigger part
of the strategy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So Mike, it has always been important, but I do think the recent events and the customer behavior changes has
even accelerated that further. And you can see that in the numbers of nearly 80% of transactions now occurring in
a digital fashion. The branch activity as far as transactions is down a lot.
On the sales side, I talk about the loan sales. But actually, total sales in the branches have doubled since a year –
excuse me, on the digital platform have doubled versus a year ago. And so we do expect those digital
investments, both do-it-yourself and do-it-together, in other words, co-browsing or virtual activity is going to
continue to be important, not just for the consumer but across many business lines.
So that investment that we're making is important on two fronts. It's important to make sure we're giving the
customer the best experience in connecting with them in the ways they choose to, and it's also offering
efficiencies in the long run.
As we talked about, we announced over a year ago that we expect to have 10% to 15% fewer branches. And I
would expect that number to increase in terms of the number of fewer branches that we have because of this
change in customer behavior. Branches will still be important, but the number of them and the size of them will be
fewer and less.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. Going back to the Paycheck Protection Program, we talked a little bit about the
expectations for forgiveness there. But do you have a timeline on where you think your $7-plus billion in PPP
loans may start to be forgiven?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Well, we do expect that there's going to be some forgiveness that's going to take place as early as the third
quarter. So there's going to be some runoff of the balances just because of that. I think the vast majority of it
happens late third, fourth and early first quarter in terms of timing. That's our expectation right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then on the deposit side, obviously, very good deposit growth there. How do you see the
trajectory of that playing out, taking into consideration the PPP and all liquidity that's built in now? And how does it
impact the size of the balance sheet through the rest of the year?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Yeah, well our expectation is that the deposit growth is going to continue to be strong at least through the end of
the year, if not into early next year. And it's really highly correlated to the amount of liquidity that the Fed is
continuing to pump into the system. The impacts from a balance sheet perspective, as you know, I think, certainly
you have a funding benefit associated with that. The challenge is always trying to identify if you get the loan
growth, great, if you don't, you're going to have to look for opportunities on the investment side of the equation.
But we do expect strong growth in deposits into the foreseeable future because of the Fed programs.

Andrew J. Cecere A

Hey, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi. Hey, guys. Hey, good morning. Just one question on the expense side. Obviously, much stronger-than-
expected revenues, especially out of mortgage, but noting that you're talking about some of the COVID costs
coming off and that even some of the like, I would think, incentive related cost type of stuff like mortgage will be
softer sequentially. You're still talking about flattish expenses sequentially. I was wondering if maybe you can kind
of put that in context with some of the broader reaching comments you just made about the future of the expense
base in terms of why you'd only expect to see flat expenses sequentially. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. The areas that we're going to see growth or not – I mean, on a sequential basis, I do think you're going to
see revenue related sort of expenses coming down a bit, we will see COVID-related expenses coming down.
There's still going to be a fairly significant amount of PPP and costs associated with all sorts of things, that will
end up happening in the third quarter.
The other thing that I think that ends up coming into play is just timing with respect to, for example, other loan
expenses and when they end up getting recognized relative to the mortgage production that occurred. So we
recognize revenue in the quarter in which the application is taken and locked, but a lot of the expenses end up
happening in the quarter that's following that, simply because of the timing of closing loans and that sort of thing.
So that's a big driver that ends up impacting the sequential growth from second to third quarter that you have to
keep in mind.

Okay. And a follow-up on the money market fee waivers. You had mentioned earlier that you would expect them
to be larger than last time. Can you put that into a numeric context for us? How much were you waiving either on
an annual basis or at peak through the last cycle? And how is the asset management complex differ in terms of
mix today versus then? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yes. In terms of the mix of the product that we end up offering, I think there's probably a more government or
govie based sort of money market as opposed to prime based. The prime base declined fairly significantly. But
the overall, when you end up looking at assets under management, it's certainly we're at a higher level today than
10 years ago. That's the reason.
I think that the rate of the fee waivers will be pretty similar, but just the assets under management in the wealth
management space is higher. And I'm trying to put my fingers on kind of what that looks like right now, but we
certainly can kind of get back to you, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Mark Runkel A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. The reserve ratio on the credit card was 10.14% at the end of June, that's question number one. The
second in terms of those customers that have come off some of the programs that we've gotten in place, we've
seen very strong payment performance to date. About 70% of those customers have started to make normal
payments after those periods of time. We've seen a few of those, about 20% reenrolled, and then the rest has
moved into delinquency. So, so far, so good on customer performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So if you kind of think about the – when I end up looking at the current run rate, just given the environment

going to look like, at least for a while.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
What are your customers – when you talk to your customers, and I understand the restaurants and the leisure
guys are still feeling a lot of pain, but can you give us some color on what are your commercial customers telling
you? What are they seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So first, you're absolutely right, there are some mixed signals. And I think the mixed signals is the sort of
the competing factors of the stress in the economy from the shutdown, offset by the stimulus that's occurring
across many categories, unemployment benefits, the stimulus checks, PPP, all those things. And those are
competing forces, which makes modeling and projecting very difficult in this environment.
I would say small businesses are struggling the most for a lot of different reasons, principally, because they have
less cushion than the larger companies. The larger companies, as Terry mentioned, initially, they were very
defensive, drawing down in excess of $22 billion, but about two-thirds of that is paid back.
So while certain industries continue to be stressed, you're seeing other industries that are actually doing a little bit
better in this environment. So, small, challenged; middle and large, mixed, some doing well and some not so
much. Terry, what would you add, or Mark?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
No.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Runkel A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, U.S. Bancorp
No, I think that's well said. I mean, I think it's right and spot on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And then, as a follow-up, in the reserving and the provisioning you guys did this quarter, I know you mentioned
there's a lot of moving parts, as you just touched on it, Andy. But how much would you say of the provisioning was
allocated to specific credits that you're now starting to see obviously distressed, versus just building up the
general reserves?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean I'll have Mark kind of add to this. But certainly, when we end up looking at net charge-offs and
things like that, there hasn't been a lot of movement, especially on the consumer side of the equation. We are
starting to see non-performing assets on commercial starting to grow, as we talked about. But it's still, what I
would say, relatively early.
I think the government stimulus programs and things like that have kind of, at least, for some period of time,
muted. Some of those underlying credit characteristics that you typically see, so more of it or most of it is really
driven based upon kind of our outlook, when we think about the economic conditions going forward.

And then at the end I was looking at kind of the split between products, it's probably more heavily weighted, 60-
plus percent of the reserve build really, more focused on wholesale and commercial real estate as opposed to
consumer at this particular point in, Mark, what would get?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Runkel A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, U.S. Bancorp
The only other thing I might add is, you mentioned this in the early comments, we've gone through the portfolio
very granular and downgraded the credits appropriately should we feel like, all of that's been factored into the
analysis on the allowance.

the commercial side, is really heavily energy and the retail sector, and then on the commercial real estate is going
to be some of the retail-related exposure as well. It's coming off a very low point as we note, but those are the
