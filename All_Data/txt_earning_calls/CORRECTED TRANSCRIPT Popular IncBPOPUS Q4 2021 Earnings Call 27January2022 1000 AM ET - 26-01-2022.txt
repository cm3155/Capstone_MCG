MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Popular, Inc. Q4 2021 Earnings Call. My name is Emily, and I'll be
coordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions]
I will now hand the call over to our host, Paul Cardillo, Investor Relations Officer at Popular, Inc. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul J. Cardillo
Investor Relations Officer, Popular, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With us on the call today is our CEO, Ignacio Alvarez; our COO,
Javier Ferrer; our CFO, Carlos Vázquez; and our CRO, Lidio Soriano. They will review our results for the full year
and fourth quarter and then answer your questions. Other members of our management team will also be
available during the Q&A session.
Before we start, I would like to remind you that on today's call, we may make forward-looking statements that are
based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press
release and are detailed in our SEC filings. You may find today's press release and our SEC filings on our
webpage at popular.com.
I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Ignacio Alvarez.

Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge our recently
appointed Chief Operating Officer, Javier Ferrer. Javier joined Popular as a Chief Legal Officer in 2014 and has
made important contributions through our strategic initiatives these past years. As COO, he will continue to

provide strategic and operational guidance to our senior management team. Javier passes the legal baton to José
Coleman, who has assumed the position as Chief Legal Officer. José has been with Popular since 2017. We are
confident that each of these appointments will strengthen our senior management team.
Today's results reflect another solid quarter and an outstanding year in which we achieved record earnings. Our
results reflect the continued recovery in economic activity, our diversified sources of revenue, and prudent risk
management. I'm very pleased to report that in January we announced a series of planned capital actions that we
intend to execute this year. These actions include an increase in the company's quarterly common stock dividend
of 22% to $0.55 per share beginning in the second quarter and a common stock repurchase program of up to
$500 million. Additionally, we completed our 2021 capital plan in November with the redemption of $187 million of
our 6.7% Trust Preferred Securities. These actions evidence the strength of our capital position, which allows us
to return capital to our shareholders, while we continue to invest in our franchise.
Please turn to slide 3. Our annual net income of $935 million reflects an increase of $428 million above our 2020
annual net income of $507 million. The increase was largely driven by lower provision expense, higher fees, and
higher net interest income and was partially offset by higher expenses. 2021 results also benefited from strong
deposit growth and a higher level of earning assets in both Puerto Rico and the US. Credit quality continued to
improve throughout 2021, NPLs decreased by $190 million or 26%, and net charge-offs were 7 basis points in
2021, compared to 66 basis points in the prior year. We are pleased with how our portfolios have performed,
particularly with net charge-offs below that 10 basis points for the year. Our capital levels are strong, with a year-
end common equity tier-1 ratio of 17.5%. Our tangible book value ended 2021 at $65.39, a 4%increase year-over-
year.
Please turn to slide 4. Our quarterly net income of $206 million was $42 million lower than the third quarter and
$30 million higher than the same quarter of 2020. The sequential variance was driven by a lower benefit in the
provision for credit losses, higher expenses, and lower fee income, partially offset by higher net interest income.
Loan growth was solid in the quarter, particularly in Popular Bank, with some commercial loans increased by
12%. Our margins continued to be impacted by the low rate environment and our asset mix. However, we are
encouraged with the margin expansion and the US business. Credit quality trends continue to be favorable in the
period with lower NPLs and net recovery in charge-offs.
Please turn to slide 5. Our customer base in Puerto Rico grew by 43,000 in 2021, of which 1,800 was in the fourth
quarter to reach nearly 1.95 million unique customers. Adoption of digital channels among our retail customers
continued to be strong. Active users on Mi Banco platform exceeded 1.1 million and had grown by 3% in
December 2020 and by 20% in December 2019. We captured two-thirds of our deposits during the period through
digital channels. This trend remains significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. The dollar value of credit and
debit card sales for our customers have continued to trend higher, increasing by 7% compared to the same
quarter a year ago and by 25% in 2021 as compared to 2020. Auto loan and lease originations at BPPR have
remained very strong. While they decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, they were 23% higher year-
over-year in 2021. The housing market also continues to be robust. The dollar value of mortgage originations at
BPPR decreased by 11% sequentially in the fourth quarter, but the full year originations increased by 28% as
compared to 2020.
Please turn to slide 6 for an update on the current macro environment in Puerto Rico. In the fourth quarter, the
economy performed well as business trends and customer activity remained solid. New auto and used auto sales
reflect strong consumer demand. For the year, 129,000 new units were sold compared to 95,000 units in 2020
and it is the highest annual level of reported sales since 2005. The Puerto Rico Economic Activity Index, which

includes total employment, cement sales, electricity generation, and gasoline sales, has been improving, and as
of November 2021, it has returned to pre-pandemic levels.
Employment levels have also continued to improve. According to a recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, employment levels in Puerto Rico have recovered more quickly than in many other jurisdictions and
have now surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Cement sales have remained strong. In 2021, sales were 13% higher
compared to 2020. Airport traffic has also continued to improve. Passenger volume doubled in 2021 compared to
last year and increased by 3% compared to 2019, which itself was a strong year. Activity levels in the tours and
hospitality sector have also been a source of strength for the local economy in 2021. While the recent surge in
COVID cases may impact the industry in the near term, Puerto Rico continues to be a popular destination [ph] or
mainland residence (00:08:05).
The recent court approval of the plan of adjustment should be an important catalyst for Puerto Rico's fiscal and
economic recovery. The plan eliminates uncertainty and provides necessary clarity to govern confidently planned
investments toward Puerto Rico's sustainable growth. A significant amount of time and effort has been invested to
get us to this point, and we look forward to refocusing these resources on the island's long-term economic
development. We are very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter. We continue to be optimistic about the
prospects for the future, yet will remain attentive to how the evolving health situation may impact the economy.
And I'll turn the call over to Carlos for more details on our financial results.

Carlos J. Vázquez
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio. Good morning. Before we turn to the fourth quarter results, let me expand on Popular's 2021
full year performance, which is included in the Appendix to this presentation and today's press release. Our net
interest income increased by 5% year-over-year to $1.96 billion due to the growth in earning assets. In 2021, we
reported a provision benefit of $194 million compared to a provision expense of $293 million in 2020. The
provision benefit was driven by the current recovery, the continued strength of economic projections, and low
levels of charge-offs. Non-interest income increased by 25% year-over-year with most segments higher in 2021
versus 2020. Operating expenses increased 6% for the year to $1.55 billion. Higher personnel, technology, and
regulatory costs were the primary drivers. Our capital position is robust. We ended the year with a tangible book
value increasing by more than $2 per share to $65.39, notwithstanding the repurchase of $350 million of common
stock.
Please turn to slide 7. As usual, additional information is provided in the Appendix to the slide deck. Today's
earnings press release details variances from the third quarter. Net interest income for the fourth quarter was
$501 million, an increase of $12 million from Q3. Non-interest income decreased by $5 million to $165 million in
Q4. The impact of two items in Q3 contributed to these results. A $10 million gain associated with the sale of two
corporate office buildings and income from investments held under the equity method that are $5.4 million lower
in Q4. These negative variances were partially offset by $4 million higher seasonal contingent insurance
commissions and $2 million higher credit card fees.
Going forward, we expect that the average quarterly level of non-interest income will be around $155 million to
$160 million. The provision for the fourth quarter was a benefit of $33 million. This was $28 million lower than the
benefit recorded in the third quarter. Total operating expenses were $417 million in the quarter, an increase of
$29 million from Q3. This increased price was impacted by higher employee compensation caused by $3 million,
mostly driven by salary increases, higher incentives and commissions, equipment expense up by $3 million and
seasonal business promotion expenses up by $8 million, including $2 million higher credit card rewards expense.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
Other operating expenses increased by $15 million due to higher sundry losses by $10 million, which includes $4
million related to the termination of a white label credit card contract and high impairment losses on undeveloped
properties of $5 million. Also, amortization of intangibles rose by $5 million due to the write-down of a trademark.
Excluded $10 million of impairments and write-downs just mentioned, our expenses would have been within our
prior guidance for Q4.
For 2022, we expect average quarterly expenses to be around $415 million. The increase from 2021 is driven by
higher expenses in the following categories. Firstly, now as we continue to invest in training and compensation
with the related benefit cost also increasing. This is driven by a tight labor market in Puerto Rico and in the
regions where we operate in the mainland. Technology as we continue to modernize our digital capabilities, pure
obsolescence and address regulatory, cyber and compliance needs.
And finally, business promotion, especially in expenses related to reward programs for our clients. Some of these
higher technology and reward expenses are related to our expectation of higher levels of client activity. Obviously,
we will strive to come in below this expected level of expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27% and
for the full year 2021 was 25%. In 2022, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 18% and 20%. A higher
tax rate in 2021 was related to the tax effect of the provision releases during the year.
Please turn to slide 8. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $544 million, $8 million higher than
the third quarter. The increase in non-interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was mainly related to the
repayment of PCD loans and higher PPP fees, as one of the activity recognized in the quarter from our recently
acquired lease financing business. Deposits grew by $1 billion in the quarter. The growth was in BPPR with a
$700 million increase in our retail and commercial deposits and a $300 million increase in public deposits. Net
interest margin was essentially flat. The total loan yield increased by 11 basis points in Q4, again, mostly on PPP
fees and repayment of PCD loans. PPP loans yielded 17.9% in this quarter compared to 10.1% in Q3 due to
higher accelerated recognition of fee income of our forgiveness. In 2021, we recognized $82 million in income
from this program. The outstanding year-end balance of PPP loans is $353 million. The remaining unamortized
portion of fees for this portfolio is approximately $18 million, which we expect to recognize during the first half of
2022.
As of the end of the fourth quarter, Puerto Rico public deposits were roughly $21 billion. Given the approval of the
plan of adjustment, we anticipate that approximately $7 billion to $10 billion of public deposits will leave the bank
by the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter. This will reduce loan yielding assets on our balance
sheet. As of 12/31, every $1 billion decrease in public deposits would have increased our net interest margin by 4
to 5 basis points. It's important to reiterate that this anticipated outflow of deposits will not be a liquidity event for
the bank, as by loaning Puerto Rico these deposits must be collateralized. We continue to be asset sensitive due
to our large cash position, driven by elevated public deposit balances. Even with the expected outflow of some
[indiscernible] (00:16:04) deposit, we will continue being asset sensitive. As of December 2021, each 25 basis
points change in Fed funds would correspond to a $6 million to $8 million change in net interest income per
quarter.
Our ending loan balances increased by $389 million in the quarter. This increase occurred despite $317 million
decrease in PPP loans. Excluding the impact of PPP, loan balances grew by $706 million in Q4, reflecting higher
commercial loan balances of Popular Bank and to a lesser extent higher auto, personal, credit card, and
commercial balances in Puerto Rico. The increase in the US included the acquisition of K2, which added $105
million in loans. These balance increases were of same part by lower construction balances both in the US and
Puerto Rico as well as continued trend like run-off in the mortgage portfolio in Puerto Rico of $112 million. We are

encouraged by the demand for credit at BPPR and already seeing growth in most segments. Despite these
positive trends, we do not expect overall loan growth to materialize in Puerto Rico until the middle of this year
when demand resulting from expected economic growth should outpace the forgiveness of PPP loans and the
mortgage run-off.
Please turn to slide 9. Capital levels remain strong. Our common equity tier-1 ratio in Q4 was 17.5% flat with Q3.
Tangible book value decreased in the quarter by approximately 1% to $65.39, primarily driven by the higher
accumulated unrealized losses on investments. Our return on tangible equity was 19.4% in the fourth quarter. To
review our 2021 capital action, last year, we repurchased $350 million in common stock, increased our quarterly
dividend by $0.05 per share to $0.45 per share, redeemed $187 million in high [ph] cost prefs (00:18:17) and
finally acquired a national healthcare equipment leasing business for $157 million.
As Ignacio mentioned at the start of today's call, our announced 2022 capital plan includes two actions. First, an
increase of Popular's quarterly common dividend by $0.10 to $0.55 per share starting Q2. Secondly, we will be
executing a common stock repurchase program of up to $500 million. While our recent buyback programs have
been executed via ASR, the implementation plan for this buyback is still under consideration. We have returned to
our normal capital planning schedule, which should result in an announcement of Popular's 2023 capital actions
no later than our January 2023 webcast. We will continue to explore opportunities to manage our capital structure
during the remaining of 2022 and in future periods.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lidio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano
Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Carlos, and good morning. Overall, Popular continued to exhibit strong credit quality trend and low
credit costs with net recovery and decreasing non-performing loans. We continue to closely monitor COVID-19
pandemic-related risk on borrower performance and changes in the pace of economic recovery as new variants
continue to emerge. However, we're optimistic given recent credit performance, economic outlook, and
improvements in the risk profile of the corporation's loan portfolios.
Turning to slide number 10, non-performing assets decreased by $77 million to $633 million this quarter, mainly
driven by an NPL decrease of $85 million, offset in part by an OREO increase of $8 million. The decreasing NPLs
was mainly in Puerto Rico, driven by lower commercial NPLs of $63 million, primarily due to payoffs and
paydowns related to troubled loan resolution. Also contributing to the decrease were loans that returned to
accrual status during the quarter, coupled with lower mortgage NPLs of $21 million and lower construction NPLs
of $14 million. In the US, NPLs increased by $10 million, mainly due to mortgage loans that did not resume
payment at the end of the pandemic deferral period.
Year-over-year, NPLs decreased by $190 million or 26%, mostly in Puerto Rico, due to improvements in
economic performance. Compared to the third quarter, NPL inflows excluding consumer loans increased by $3
million, driven by an increase of $10 million in the US due to the higher mortgage inflows as discussed before,
offset by lower commercial and mortgage NPL inflows in Puerto Rico. The OREO increase in the quarter was
driven by the resumption of foreclosure activity in the Puerto Rico mortgage portfolio. At the end of the quarter,
the ratio of NPLs to total loans held-in-portfolio was 1.9% compared to 2.2% in the previous quarter and 2.5% in
the year ago period.
Turning to slide number 11, net charge-off amounted to a net recovery of $8 million or an annualized negative 11
basis points of average loans held-in-portfolio compared to $9 million or 12 basis points in the previous quarter.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
The variance in net charge-off was mainly driven by the resolution of the previously mentioned commercial non-
performing loans. For the year, the net charge-off ratio improved by 59 basis points from 66 basis points in 2020
to 7 basis point this year, driven by improvements in both regions across all major loan categories.
The corporation allowance for credit losses decreased by $23 million to $695 million, driven mainly by improving
credit quality, improvements in mortgage-related industries and [indiscernible] (00:22:37) values, coupled with
releases from our qualitative reserves. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans held-in-portfolio decreased
slightly to 2.38% from 2.49% in the third quarter and is down from 2.89% as of CECL Day 1. The ratio of
allowance for credit losses to NPLs held-in-portfolio was 127% compared to 114% in the prior quarter. The
provision for credit losses was a benefit of $31 million compared to a benefit of $59 million in the previous quarter.
Please turn to slide number 12. The variance in allowance for credit losses was driven by changes to qualitative
reserves and economic outlook as well as portfolio credit quality and mix offset in part by changes in economic
scenario [indiscernible] (00:23:36). During the quarter we released $17 million from our qualitative reserves
prompted by the economic environment and improvements in borrower performance. Portfolio changes driven
mainly by credit quality and volume mix caused the ACL to decrease by $28 million. This quarter, in response to
uncertainty caused by Omicron and the setback in President Biden's Build Back Better Plan, we increased the
pessimistic scenario weight, which contributed to an increase of $30 million in reserves. However, the
macroeconomic scenarios from Puerto Rico and the US continue to show a positive outlook for the economy.
To summarize, our loan portfolio exhibited strong credit quality metrics with net recoveries in the charge-offs and
decreasing non-performing loans. We're optimistic given recent credit performance, economic outlook, and
improvements in the risk profile of the operations loan portfolio.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Lidio and Carlos, for your updates. 2021 was an outstanding year for Popular driven by record
earnings, improved credit quality, record deposit levels, continued customer growth, and the successful execution
of our capital actions. We are optimistic about the economic outlook. In addition to the unprecedented level of
Federal stimulus related to COVID, Puerto Rico still has a significant amount of hurricane recovery funds that
have yet to be disbursed, but have now begun to flow at a faster pace. The combined impact of these factors,
along with the continued progress on the resolution of Puerto Rico's fiscal issues should generate considerable
economic activity in many sectors for the coming years, and we are well-positioned to benefit from such activity.
I'm very proud to report that both BPPR and Popular Bank each now offer Bank On-certified deposit accounts.
Bank On-certified accounts were created by the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, a national non-profit
organization to promote financial inclusion for underbanked and unbanked consumers through standard account
features that ensure low costs while offering robust transactions capabilities. In Puerto Rico, we are the only bank
that is currently offering a Bank On product. At Popular, the mission of financial inclusion and equal access to
banking closely aligns with the core values of our organization. We are committed to improving access to financial
services for members of our community that have for numerous reasons remained outside the traditional banking
system.
We are also proud to have been included in this year's Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index as we will continue to
make strides in gender parity at Popular and across the financial industry. Our commitment to fostering a

workplace that values inclusion, respect, and accountability doesn't just make us a better employer, it makes us a
stronger organization.
And last but certainly not least, I'd like to thank our entire team for their patience and resilience in helping us
achieve our record results. It goes without saying that our employees continue to be our greatest source of
strength. We are now ready for your questions.

Hey, guys, good morning.

Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
I wanted to first ask congrats on the loan growth in the US bank and that changed the tonner on the path of loan
portfolio. Can you talk may be a little bit about the continued momentum, if possible, on the US side and K2 and if
the trends we saw in the fourth quarter, if that might continue to translate during 2022 and if the Puerto Rico bank
starts to maybe have stronger trends as well that kind of contributes to a better trend for positive net growth and
maybe we're thinking a quarter or so ago.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Brett, yeah, I think the fourth quarter was actually a great quarter for the US operation, but it did follow to be a
slower third quarter. So, I would have projected the fourth quarter would be the normal rate of growth, but we are
anticipating solid growth in the US. And Puerto Rico, I think we've been very consistent of saying we're starting to
see loan demand pick up and we continue to see that. And as Carlos mentioned in his remarks, we expect that by
the second half of the year that loan growth in Puerto Rico will outpace our mortgage run-off and our PPP
repayment. So, we continue to be optimistic. But I think, I wouldn't project the fourth quarter US as their run rate,
but they have a strong book and I think we're looking forward to that production. But I would not project the fourth
quarter as a normal rate of growth.

Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. Fair enough. And then, was the deposit outflow, well, if I have this right – if you're deposits are down $7
billion, it's marginally up around 35 basis points. If I heard you correctly, it was 45 basis points per $1 billion of
deposits, was that the correct number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
That is correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay, okay. And then on the expense guidance for $415 million, would there be a progression during the year of
that or is that more of how you kind of view the quarters in general and either they're kind of flat throughout the
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Brett, there usually is some volatility in our expense, our total expenses on the [ph] fourth (00:30:01) quarter
basis. So, they very rarely are flat during the year. They sort of tend to go up during the year, actually. So, that is
the reason we've described it as $415 million average quarterly for the year. It may be that we have a couple of
quarters that will be lower and then we may end up with a couple of quarters that will be higher. But again, there
has historically been some seasonality in our expenses as you know. It probably will repeat itself this year, but
we're not sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay, okay. And then the last is kind of a housekeeping issue, I don't have – I've seen a couple of different
numbers and so you mentioned the funds disbursed still to come for Puerto Rico and I've seen a few different
numbers and the number, I guess I've seen a lot $40 billion. Would you guys have a better number for the funds
that are yet to be disbursed in Puerto Rico?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I think I agree that it's hard to figure out. But if you if you take the FEMA, CDBG, you had that the COVID
relief, and then the infrastructure bill, we think there's probably between $50 billion to $60 billion left to be
disbursed.

Let's see, capital return. Talk about the ASR under consideration, is that just the timing issue where it's technically
always under consideration at this point or might you really do a different structure there? And secondly, can you
talk about whether it's refinancing sub debt or other items kind of other organic uses of capital?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Right. On your first question, we have, as I mentioned, used ASR in the last few years, but we have no
predecision made. Every year we actually sit down and we look at the market and we look at what we think is
going to happen and consider all the alternatives. So, the real answer to your question is an all alternative to
execute the buyback are still open. And as soon as we make a decision, we will let the market know, but at this
point in time all alternatives are open.
On your second question, yeah, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I mean, we'll look at opportunities into
the rest of the year and next year and again if we make any decisions or when we make any decisions, we will
probably announce them to the market.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And separately on the non-interest revenue guide $155 million to $160 million if I cut that correctly, that
looks just a bit below your current run rate and especially showing momentum on the fee side, just wanted to dig
in that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. The run rate has been a bit higher. But if you break down the summation of all those lines of fees, Brock,
for the last couple of quarters, there's been a number of things in those quarters are unusual. So, my commentary
was more directed to sort of the run rate of the normal fees as opposed to trying to incorporate unused items in it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. But...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
It has been a bit higher in the last two quarters. You're correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And if any of that guidance due to elimination of [ph] NCF (00:34:22) fees, that's a constant question I get?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
As every other bank is, I guess, we are in the process of concluding our analysis of all overdraft and overdraft
fees, there's a lot of lines that are wrongly described as overdraft fees that are not necessarily the same activities
by the client. So, we're in the process of going through and analyzing what our personal practices are and what
we could make sense. We have not concluded that analysis. But what I can tell you is that in our case, the
summation of all those fees is about $20 million a year and of course, not all those lines of fees will be affected,
because some of those people will continue moving forward. But we haven't concluded our analysis yet.

line is open.

Q
Hi, good morning.

Ignacio Alvarez A

Good morning.

Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Hi. Maybe just circling back on expenses, maybe another way of asking that question. So, you pointed to a
personnel expense technology and business promotions activity in 2022 driving that average rate higher. I guess
of the planned personnel, technology, and business promotion spend, how much already is accomplished? And
maybe give a timeline as to some of the bigger projects that are slated to come online during 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean our expense lines tend to be rather volatile. So, that's one of the reasons we have shied away from
giving guidance on a per line basis and we keep our guidance on the aggregate expense level. What I can tell you
is that a significant part of the increase will be in the personnel line as we're seeing very real pressure on
competitive pressure on the personnel side. As we've made public, for example, at the beginning of this year we
increased our minimum wage in Puerto Rico from $11 to $13 an hour. So, that will obviously affect the full year
2022. We also increased our minimum wage in the Virgin Islands and in both of our US markets. So, that is a big
part of it. The technology one is broken up in our expense lines in a whole bunch of different lines. It's a little bit
unusual for us in our case about the technology expense in personnel or professional fees because our
relationship with EVERTEC with the equipment lines, so they're broken up all over the expense lines. And again,
that's one of the reasons we try to stay away from line by line guidance, however, give you general guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. Thank you for that. And then maybe looking at the residential run-off of the Puerto Rico book there, it looks
like the pace of run-off slowed in the fourth quarter a little bit. I guess, what's your expectation with higher interest
rates to the pace of refi activity and could we actually get kind of normalization and stability in the [indiscernible]
(00:38:09) book sooner than expected with the help of rates?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
I mean, you're right, the run-off rate was slightly lower. I think it was around $130 million or something like that in
the third quarter as $112 million this quarter. I would expect with rates going up the run-off rate may slow down
somewhat. Yes, but even in an environment where rates weren't changing as much, the run-off rate was still $20
million, $25 million a quarter. So, yes, it could become lower than $112 million. I'm not sure if it's going to become
immensely smaller than $110 million – $112 million, but with higher rates it should become smaller, yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. Thank you. And then just lastly from me, maybe a bigger picture question. Can you just provide us with an
update on the EVERTEC situation and kind of what's your ongoing plan is with that investment? Could we see
something in the near term or are you really reluctant to do much with that, I think the service agreement runs
until 2025, if I'm not mistaken. Are you likely to do something prior to that or do you want to go through that
process first before making any decisions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. We have three and a half years to go on that. Obviously, we would try to reach an arrangement with
EVERTEC before the end of the period for the benefit of both going forward. But still it's too early to say much
more than that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Understood. Okay. Thank you.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Correct. Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. So, then just dig in a little bit more into that, if we do get some loan growth later in this year, which we're all
very much hoping for, can you just remind us what kind of the new loan yields are that you'd be deploying cash at
if that growth comes in the various categories?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Well, it will depend on the mix, Alex. I think the best thing you can do is look at the years, which we've closed
every one of the different business lines in the press release. And start thinking about that and hopefully rates go
up, some of the businesses may do a little bit better. But it is hard because if we end up, for example,
[indiscernible] (00:41:15) a lot more higher FICO credit card, higher FICO auto loans, then the yield may not go up
even though market rates are going up simply because the risk profile is changing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. But in terms of the sort of the expected yields that you'd see unlike a commercial loan today, those are
pretty close to that sort of 5.5% range that we're seeing on the average balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, if we actually look at the yields in our loan books, they don't move as much as market rates do.
They're being a little lower. So, they're probably going to be around that ballpark again. The thing that could swing
it is the big change of mix though if we end up doing bigger loans in different sectors or something.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. And then in the past you've been hesitant to deploy...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
By the way, Alex, one more thing, about one-third of the book is floating rate. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
One-third of the commercial book or one-third of the total portfolio?

Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then, in the past, you've been hesitant to deploy liquidity to securities just given where the tenure was
and we're up about 50 basis points since we last had this conversation. I know you did some purchases in the
fourth quarter. Can you give us some color on the timing and what you actually deployed in terms of liquidity in
the fourth quarter? And then kind of how your outlook is from here in terms of security purchases early in 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yes. As you know, for the last, I think four quarters we've been moving cash into the securities portfolio every one
of the last four quarters. The increase in the fourth quarter was about $500 million roughly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
A bit more.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
A bit more. So, it's something that we have been doing for the last few quarters as we found rates a little bit more
interesting. This is literally a decision that we make in our weekly ALCO committee and we have a very capable
treasurer whose job it is to do that business for us. So, we'll keep looking at alternatives to the extent that rates
continue to go up and are more attractive. We will be – our probability that we will redeploy cash will go up, but
there's no specific plan I can describe to you right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Can you give us some color on the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Do remember that we hold treasury securities in our investment portfolio Puerto Rico, the income from those
securities is tax exempt. So, it's important not to forget that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah and that's an important point. But just in terms of what you did in the fourth quarter or that been done late in
the quarter or early in the quarter, just so we can kind of get a sense for what's already impacted the NII line in the
fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
It was done late in the quarter.

Okay. And then just switching to loan growth and you talk about some of the Maria money coming in and if you
drill into some of those programs, there is a pretty large component, especially some of the CDBG money that
really requires bank funding. I was just wondering if you can give us an update on kind of what that pipeline could
look like. I heard from another bank down there that that a lot of those applications, that there's a huge number of
applications for some of the programs that are kind of awaiting government approval at this point. And maybe you
can just give us a little bit of color on sort of what that process is like and when you could actually see some
disbursements for those types of loans and hopefully whether or not it's in 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. It's a kind of a complex answer because it's a complex situation. We have different sources of funds, right?
So, you get the FEMA funds, you've got the CDBG fund, you've got COVID relief money, and now you have the
infrastructure. I think the CDBG has gone through a process requesting proposals and they're pretty advanced. A
lot of people have filed proposals, and they're in the process of analyzing them. So, what I would expect that by
the end of the year it's a process, right, because the proposal is going to approve and you have to get the plan,
the permit. But the money is starting to flow not as in the massive amounts what they're submitting, but money is
starting to flow, especially the COVID relief funds had very few restrictions. So, that money you're seeing already
in [indiscernible] (00:46:01) and things like that on a lesser extent.
I think the CDBG will begin to flow this year certain of their programs and FEMA goes at a slower pace, but it's
also moving in the right direction. They've awarded a number of projects now and they're in the design phase. So,
I think this year won't be the year where the [ph] sprinkler (00:46:22) will be wide open. You'll see and it's hard to
predict because I'm not trying to be elusive. It is very hard for everyone to predict how fast these things move.
They're beginning to move. So, I would expect to – we'll see more on this Christmas this year. The infrastructure
bill has a lot of money for highways and roads and bridges also. So, if I think we'll begin to see this year,
especially the second half and next year picking up again and the next year picking up again. I mean, some of the
big, big money projects like the rebuild of the energy sector take longer because that's a very complex process
where they have to go through the energy board and they have to go to the review process. But I think some of
the money for housing and for other projects for economic development in the CDBG will start to flow this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Right. And if you just kind of peel back the onion a little bit on the loan growth guide, PPP is obviously going away
in the next couple of quarters. We know that residential run-off is going to be a persisting issue. If we just look at
the commercial portfolio, just the commercial standalone portfolio in Puerto Rico, which I guess would include
commercial real estate and construction, would you anticipate that portfolio to grow exclusive, of course, the PPP
over the next couple of quarters? And maybe talk a little bit about what the pipeline could look like, utilization
rates, and whether or not you have any construction loans that maybe have been approved, but haven't really
seen disbursements yet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I wouldn't get into single construction projects, our book is big enough. But I think as we said before, we do expect
our portfolio to grow the second half of the year and that we do expect the commercial loan portfolio to grow.
There have been lines granted for different construction projects. Those lines, the utilization really probably isn't
as high as they've been in the past because, for example, the ones that are used to build residential units are
being sold much faster than in the past and people now are more prudent how they build off. So, they build in

stages so they don't build the whole project at a time. They build in stages to get repaid. But, yeah, we expect, I
think there will be infrastructure projects, there'll be commercial projects. So, we do expect loan growth in the
commercial sector in the second half.
We're seeing a lot of interest in different things. As you know, the King of Spain was here the other day and they
brought a commercial mission, a lot of interest from US investors. But also we have a lot of Spanish investors
very interested in different types of projects. So, again, we do think commercial in general is going to see growth
in the second half. We don't have this particular pipeline because our book is just too big and I think too complex
to get there. But generally we're optimistic and positive in what we're seeing in terms of clients coming in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Actually ex-PPP commercial book [indiscernible] (00:49:19). So, we're positive in that. Construction can be a little
bit more volatile depending on the project and stage and stuff like that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Understood. And then just one more question that I wanted to make sure you guys address on this call, when I
look at the press release you guys put out a couple of weeks ago on the capital return can't help, but to notice that
the language that you put in last year's press release about the – I think last year you said that that
announcement on the buyback was it for the whole year, that language missing from this year's press release. Am
I reading too much into that or is the door just open for kind of everything at this point? We know that we're going
to have a $500 million buyback and growth really picks up, maybe that's all you get this year, but if the growth
doesn't materialize and you don't see M&A as a potential, that maybe there could be some more buyback later in
the year as other uses of capital either do or don't materialize?

Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
I mean, they haven't concluded all of their transactions, okay? There are still some restructuring [indiscernible]
(00:51:46) lot of companies are pending. So, there could be some more outflow related to those. Those are
smaller. I think when this amount of liquidity moves out, the government will finally get back into a normal course
of business of running the government. So, I think the flow of funds will probably get money coming in and coming
out will increase as well. So, I think what was going to happen is that we'll end up normalizing to some level of
balances that were very good in the year. As you know, it always goes up in the second quarter tax savings come
in and then it goes down during the year.
But as far as we know, it might be slightly smaller than the $11 billion that'll be left or $12 billion that'll be left after
this. But it's hard for us to figure out exactly what that new number is going to be because as you know a lot of
these accounts were not with us before, so we don't have a long history with them. There used to be a
[indiscernible] (00:52:54) before. But so, yeah, there could be some additional outflows. There should not be of
this magnitude and we will end up with a more normalized level of probably the buses moving forward again,
probably less than the net amount of this outflow, but exactly where we're not sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thank you. And then in your slide deck, you guys showed the unsecured credit ratings you have and I
noticed the S&P one is on positive outlook [indiscernible] (00:53:27) there's is a slightly below Moody's and Fitch.
Do you guys have any idea when they may come out with their determination, whether they're going to reach their
credit rating?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Not very clear. I am not sure if they will wait till they relook at the government before they relook at the rest of us.
They don't tend to move very fast, Gerard, so not very clear. We're very hopeful that these developments will be
the catalyst for some changes in our ratings. So, we are ready to get closer to what we think the company really
is. But we don't have a clear view or timetable here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. I think, Ignacio, you talked about the commercial loan growth here in the United States and in your slides
as you show that your total deposit costs at Popular Bank are about 40 basis points, which I know that's on an
absolute level low relative to history. But relative to the current period, we ran into your peers, it seems to be on
the high side. Any thoughts on what's driving that number and what could happen to that number once the Fed
starts raising interest rates as they've suggested they're going to do in months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Well, as you know we had tremendous loan growth so we had to balance our desire to reduce our interest costs
with the funding of our loans. We've been very successful this year. I think we have nine consecutive quarters
where we lowered our funding costs. Obviously if rates go up, we'll have to manage that. But remember that part
of our strategy in New York especially was to have our commercial-led strategy, so we're orienting our branches
more for commercial business where you tend to get more stable deposits, so that's a big part of our strategy. So
far, it's paying off. So, raising rates will, obviously we'll have to watch the market. As part of our strategy

especially in the New York market to go to the commercial-led growth was to rely more on commercial deposit
and retail deposits, which tend to be more volatile.

Very good. And I assume the K2 numbers are obviously in those quarterly commercial loan numbers. But thinking
and I may have missed it, I apologize, in your response to an earlier question about what drove the commercial
loan growth in the US. Is it middle market commercial real estate? Is it C9 lending? What type of commercial
lending drove the core growth in the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah, it is of the growth. What I mentioned is about $105 million was just the fact that we had in the company was
in the quarter. So, ex the leasing company was a number in the high [ph] 600 (00:56:31). What drove it was
mostly our historic plans of business is healthcare, is [indiscernible] (00:56:41) the association of banking and
CRE, which is a typical kind of business we do. So, in all the lines of – it was really growth across the board in our
historical businesses that drove the growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then just lastly, Ignacio, a lot of positive numbers coming out of Puerto Rico, which you
highlighted on the auto sales, et cetera. Can you – I don't know if there's any specific numbers you can cite, but
can you share with us what's going on with the immigration patterns, have they reversed yet? Are folks from
Puerto Rico maybe coming back onto the island or is that not happened yet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
There's a lot of anecdotal evidence. I don't have the net inflows from the airport at hand, which we usually use. I
can tell you that even the fiscal board who's not the most optimistic [indiscernible] (00:57:41) has in their most
recent fiscal plan reduced their projected level of declining population. So, they had it declining about one point
something a year and now they have it at 0.9% and that fact is what we're seeing anecdotally. We are seeing
more people coming back to the island. So, I think there's no doubt that the migration trends have improved.
I think one area where we have to work as a society, as many other societies have to work is, I'm not so worried
about migration anymore because the economics have reversed and I don't believe that the push factors – when
you talk about migration, you talk about the pull and the push. I think the push factors in Puerto Rico are much
less now. The economy is, frankly, anybody who wants a job really should be able to get a job in Puerto Rico. I
worry more about the birth rate and how we can get the birth rate up because at the end of the day, to me, that is
more important than the migration actually. Migration will work itself out, birth rates are very hard to change. But
definitely the demographic situation has improved. It's still challenging. But again, the only empirical numbers I've
seen are the projection in population growth declines, which now have improved in the most recent fiscal plan,
which has been submitted by the board.

Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Lastly, we have a follow-up question from Brock Vandervliet from UBS. Brock, please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. It's just in terms of the credit quality, it seems like credit quality is continuing to improve really across the
board. How should we think about the appropriate level of reserving? And related to that, do you think there's
something special in capping the net charge-offs in the past year because this doesn't look like the credit quality
of the bank that we used to know. It looks like the credit quality of a traditional US Bank, Mainland Bank, and that
would point to or suggest a materially lower reserve over a period of time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I think we stated before, obviously, the allowance is going to continue to be driven by credit quality,
economic outlook, and a charge-off that we experience. Over the last two years as we mentioned, we've seen
significant improvements over what was the traditional choice of rate of [indiscernible] (01:00:49). We used to be
in our corridor between 75 basis points to 125 basis points. In 2021, that was 7 basis points; in 2020, 66 basis
points. If that continues to be the case, you might see continuous releases of other provision. I'm not sure if I
answered your question, Brock.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Well, close enough. So, the key is among other things, just the continued low net charge-offs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yes. Obviously, greater development, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
And the forecast. Remember the forecast is a big part of the equation now.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you.
