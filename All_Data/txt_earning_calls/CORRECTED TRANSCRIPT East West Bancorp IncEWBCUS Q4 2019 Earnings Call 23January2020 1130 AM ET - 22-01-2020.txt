Thank you, Juliana. Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us for our full year and fourth quarter 2019
earnings call.
I will begin our discussion with a summary of results on slide 3. This morning we reported full year 2019 net
income of $674 million or $4.61 per share down by 4% compared to full year 2018 net income of $704 million or
$4.81 per share. Now excluding non-operating income – sorry, excluding non-operating items, we reported full
year 2019 adjusted net income of $708 million or $4.84 per share, an increase of 4% compared to full year 2018
adjusted net income of $682 million or $4.66 per share.
Fourth quarter 2019 net income was $188 million or $1.29 per share up by 10% compared to the third quarter net
income of $171 million or $1.17 per share and also up by 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, net income
of $173 million or $1.18 per share. Fourth quarter 2019 adjusted net income was $187 million or $1.28 per share
up by 9% quarter-over-quarter and up by 8% year-over-year. In 2019, East West achieved record full year
revenue of $1.7 billion which grew by 5% year-over-year and record net interest income of $1.5 billion which grew
by 6% year-over-year. We ended the year with record loans of $34.8 billion an increase of 7% from last year and
record deposit of $37.3 billion, an increase of 5% from 2018.
2019 also end a transformational decade for East West during which we moved, we more than doubled our asset
size to $44.2 billion and grew both our commercial loans and our non-interest bearing deposits nearly five-fold.
Over the past 10 years we achieved substantial growth and diversification in loans, deposits, and revenue
strengthening the resilience of our balance sheet, earnings, and profitability. Our diluted earnings per share also
grew by 458% in the decade. Our growth and profitability reflect the strength of our diverse business model, which
is the foundation for continued solid financial performance for years to come. In 2019 we earned a return on
assets of 1.59%, a return on equity of 14.2% and a return on tangible equity of 15.9%. This is the fifth consecutive
year of a return on tangible equity above 15%.
On slide 4 you can see the five quarter trend in our ratios, our profitability was once again strong in the fourth
quarter. Our fourth quarter 2019 return on assets was 1.68% return on equity was 15% and a return on tangible
equity was 16.7%.
Moving to slide 5, our loan portfolio is well balanced between commercial, commercial real estate and residential
mortgage loans. Over the past 10 years, we steadily made investments in people and our infrastructure, building
specialized commercial lending verticals expanding our cross-border capabilities and broadening our lending
solutions. This has resulted in a diversified platform capable of generating above industry organic loan growth
year-in, year-out.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
As of December 31, 2019, total loans reached a record $34.8 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion or 7% as I
mentioned earlier. Full year 2019 average loans of $3.4 billion grew $3.1 billion or 10% over last year. By
portfolio, residential mortgage grew 15% year-over-year. Commercial real estate and C&I both grew by 9%. In
dollar terms, loan growth was evenly distributed across the three sectors which all grew just over $1 billion each.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, average loans of $34.4 billion grew by 9% linked quarter annualized. We saw very
strong growth from commercial real estate, which increased by $505 million or 15% linked quarter annualized,
followed by residential mortgage which increased by $247 million or 12% linked quarter annualized. In fact the
fourth quarter of 2019 was the best quarter in the history of East West in terms of single-family residential
mortgage originations. Average commercial loan grew by $34 million or 1% quarter annualized.
And with that I will move on to review our 2020 outlook [indiscernible] (00:08:22) page. Apologize for that. Let me
go back to my script in order. The average loan growth of 10% in 2019 was achieved in the challenging
environment including three interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, a slowing economy and an ongoing US-
China trade tension that started to escalate in 2018 and remained high throughout the past year. At East West,
the headwinds from the US-China trade tensions are most easily visible in our wholesale trade portfolio, which
typically shows seasonally strong growth in the fourth quarter. Instead, last year we saw a decrease in
commitment of 7% and a decrease in loan outstanding of 12% year-over-year.
As of December of 2019 we have commitments of $2.35 billion and loans outstanding of $1.4 billion in a
wholesale trade portfolio. However what is less visible is the focus and active management of our commercial
loan portfolio throughout 2018 and 2019 over the course of the past two years where we could actively reduce
credit exposures particularly to customers were higher direct or indirect tariff related credit risks, largely
concentrated in the wholesale trade and manufacturing. Importantly, we have experienced only one charge-off
related trade tariff and it was less than $1 million.
East West is starting the new decade with confidence knowing that our portfolio is better positioned and stronger
today and we are ready to support our customers as the geopolitical backdrop improves. With the signing of the
partial trade agreement on January 15, we believe that there is more clarity surrounding the US-China trade
dispute. In addition our customers have adapted to the new normal of US-China relations in terms of their
operations and costs over the past two years and reduced tariffs uncertainty and geopolitical volatility should only
allow them to resume growth.
This clarity should have a positive impact for East West in particular for our ability to grow our cross-border loans
and expand our cross-border customer relationships. The value of their expertise that our cross-border bankers
bring to the table has only increased.
Receiving new interest from Chinese loans, exploring direct foreign investments or evaluating expansion
opportunities in the United States in the manufacturing, energy or service sectors. Furthermore, the expected
increase in purchase of US manufactured goods by China provides cross-border trade expansion opportunity for
our customers. Also now more than ever the need for US based business to develop a China strategy and
understand the Chinese market dynamics is vital. East West is well-positioned to take advantage of the evolving
nature of the US-China cross-border business. And we are confident about our ability to expand both our
commercial and consumer market share in this sector in 2020 and future years.
For the full year 2020, our current outlook for end of period loans is growth of 7% to 8%. We expect that to grow in
2020 will come from across all of our major loan portfolios of commercial real estate, residential mortgage and
C&I.

Now, moving onto slide 6 for a discussion of deposits. As of December 31, 2019, our end of period loan-to-
deposit ratio was 93.2%. As we have previously stated, we have comfortable operating with a loan-to-deposit ratio
in the range of 90% to 95%. Total deposit grew to a record $37.3 billion as of December 31, 2019, an increase of
$1.9 billion or 5% year-over-year. Full year 2019 average deposit of $36 billion, grew $2.8 billion or 8% from 2019.
Average deposit growth for the 2019 full year primarily came from growth in time deposits and interest-bearing
checking, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest-bearing demand accounts that's happened in the first
quarter of last year.
In fact, after declining in the first quarter due to a shift to interest-bearing checking for certain customer balances,
our noninterest-bearing demand deposits steadily grew quarter-over-quarter in the second, third and fourth
quarters.
For the fourth quarter 2019, average deposit of $37.4 billion grew by 10% linked quarter annualized, after which
deposit growth in the fourth quarter was led by growth in interest-bearing checking, which is seasonally strong in
fourth quarter for some commercial customers, followed growth in non-interest bearing deposit – demand and
money market accounts., partially offset by a decrease in average time deposits as we actively reduce higher cost
deposits. The fourth quarter 2019 average cost of deposit decreased by 11 basis points linked quarter to 0.94%
and the average cost of interest-bearing deposit decreased by 15-basis-point to 1.34%, accelerating the pace of
decrease from the third quarter.
As of December 31, 2019 the end of period cost of deposits was 0.9% down by 11-basis-point from 1% at the end
of third quarter. The end of period cost of our interest-bearing deposit was 1.28% as of December 31st, down by
15-basis-point from 1.43% as of September 30. I'm pleased to note that since the Fed began cutting the Fed
funds rate in July we achieved a reduction in the cost of deposits across all of our major deposit types while at the
same time also growing non-interest bearing demand balances.
I will now turn the call over to Irene for a more detailed discussion of our fourth quarter 2019 financial results and
our outlook for 2020.

Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Dominic. On page 7, we have a slide that shows a summary income statement and a snapshot of tax
related and notable items during the quarter. For the fourth quarter 2019 we reported diluted EPS of $1.29 and
adjusted EPS of $1.28. Our tax expense in the fourth quarter was $31 million and our effective tax rate was 14%.
This compares to a tax expense of $35 million and an effective tax rate of 17% in the third quarter. The decrease
in the fourth quarter tax rate relative to third quarter resulted from additional tax cut investments [indiscernible]
(00:16:15) of previous year's tax reserves.
Our tax expense for the full year of 2019 was $170 million and the effective tax rate was 20%. Included in the full
year 2019 income tax expense was a $30 million reversal of certain previously claimed tax credits. Adjusted full
year 2019 tax expense was $140 million and the effective tax rate was 17% compared to a tax expense of $115
million and an effective tax rate of 14% for the full year 2018. In our outlook for 2020 we project that our effective
tax rate will be 15%.
Moving onto the discussion of net interest income on page 8. Fourth quarter net interest income of $368 million
decreased by $1.6 million or 0.4% linked quarter. The fourth quarter GAAP net interest margin was 3.47% a
contraction of 12 basis points from the prior quarter. The quarter-over-quarter change in our GAAP net interest

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
margin is as follows. A 15 basis point decrease from lower loan yields, a 4 basis point decrease from lower yields
on other interest – on other interest earning assets, including investment securities, a 4 basis point decrease from
the asset mix shift, and a net increase in investment securities all of which were partially offset by an 11 basis
points increase to the net interest margin from the lower cost of funds.
ASC 310-30 discount accretion was $6 million in the fourth quarter, higher quarter-over-quarter due to recoveries
and added 6 basis points to the net interest margin. The fourth quarter adjusted net interest margin excluding the
impact of discount accretion was 3.41%. In the third quarter, discount accretion income was $2.5 million, which
added 3 basis points to the net interest margin.
As of December 31, 2019, the accretable portion of the ASC 310-30 discount accretion was $10 million and the
impact of accretion on our net interest income and our net interest margin in 2020 and beyond is expected to be
immaterial. As such we will no longer separately report the ASC 310-30 discount accretion. In our 2020 outlook,
we expect that the gap net interest margin will range between 3.40% to 3.45%. This translates to a stable margin
relative to our fourth quarter adjusted net interest margin of 3.41%. In our interest rate outlook, we assume that
the Fed funds rate will be unchanged in 2020, a tailwind to our margin supporting our NIM outlook for 2020 is a
near-term repricing benefit of our maturing time deposits.
In the first quarter of 2020, we had $3.9 billion of time deposits maturing at a weighted average rate of 1.79% and
in the second quarter of 2020 we have another $2.3 billion maturing at a weighted average rate of 1.85%. For
comparison in the fourth quarter of 2019, we originated or renewed $3.5 billion of time deposits at a weighted
average interest rate of 1.28% down from a weighted average interest rate of 1.54% in the third quarter of 2019
for new and renewing time deposits.
For your reference, we inserted slide 9 which provides the underlying interest rate detail of our loan portfolio. Our
fourth quarter 2019 average loan yield of 4.91% declined by 20 basis points linked quarter. Our loan portfolio is
largely variable rate and the most impactful interest rate indices for our loans are the prime rate in one month
LIBOR.
Now, turning to slide 10, total net interest income in the fourth quarter was $63 million compared to $51.5 million
in the third quarter. Fee income and net gains on sales of loans totaled $52.5 million in the fourth quarter, a 3%
increase from $51 million in the third quarter of 2019. Interest rate contracts and other derivative income was $18
million in the fourth quarter, a linked quarter increase of $9 million. Customer demand for interest rate hedging
products continued to be strong in the fourth quarter and customer related revenue was $14 million, an increase
of $3 million quarter-over-quarter. The associated credit valuation adjustment was $4 million in the fourth quarter,
a linked quarter increase of $6 million, reflecting the interest of the increase in long-term interest rates at the end
of the quarter.
Moving onto slide 11, fourth quarter non-interest expense was $193 million, at an increase of 9% linked quarter,
excluding amortization of tax credit investments and CDI, our adjusted non-interest expense was $165 million in
the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 4% quarter-over-quarter. The largest change quarter-over-quarter was a
$3.2 million increase in compensation expense, which was $101 million in the fourth quarter.
Our fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 38.3%, compared to 37.7% in the third quarter. Over the past five
quarters, our industry leading adjusted efficiency ratio has been under 40%. Our full year 2019 noninterest
expense was $735 million and excluding amortization of tax credit investments and CDI, it was $645 million, an
increase of 4% year-over-year.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Our full year adjusted 2019 efficiency ratio was 38.4% compared to 39.6% in 2018. The increase in noninterest
expense for the full year 2019 compared to 2018 was largely driven by an increase in compensation expense,
reflecting hires throughout the year to add talented bankers to our frontline and to ensure that we continue to
strengthen our risk management and support functions.
Additionally, in 2019 and continuing in 2020, we have been making ongoing and important investments in
technology to better serve our commercial and consumer customers and to grow our market share. In 2020, we'll
be launching a new FX system and a new commercial digital banking platform in Hong Kong which will provide
our customers enhanced cross-border payment and assets hedging capabilities as well as better interactivity with
our domestic commercial digital banking platform.
Furthermore, we are continuing to build a new consumer digital banking platform tailored to the distinct needs of
our consumer customer base. Inclusive of these investments and new systems and platforms and other ongoing
efforts to invest in our business. Our outlook for 2020 assumes operating expense growth of 4%, excluding
amortization of tax credit investments and core deposits and intangibles. This is similar to the rate of operating
expense growth in 2019.
In slide 12 of the presentation, we detail our critical asset quality metrics. Our allowance for loan losses totaled
$358 million as of December 31, 2019 or 1.03% of loans held for investment compared to 1.02% as of September
30, 2019 and 96 basis points as of December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets as of December 31, 2019 were
$122 million or 27 basis points of total assets compared to 31 basis points of total assets as of September 30, and
23 basis points of total assets as of December 31, 2018.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, our net charge-offs were $8 million or annualized 10 basis points of average loans
and we reported a provision for credit losses of $19 million. This compares to net charge-offs of $22.5 million or
annualized 26 basis points of average loans and a provision for credit losses of $38 million in the third quarter of
2019. Included in the fourth quarter net charge-offs of C&I loans which totaled $11 million, was an $8 million full
recover on a C&I loan, as well as a $5 million charge-off on an energy loan that had been placed on non-accrual
status earlier in the year.
Other C&I charge-offs in the fourth quarter came from loans that were also previously on non-accrual status and
these have largely been reserved for as of September 30, 2019.
For the full year 2019, net-charge offs were $53 million or 16 basis points of average loans compared to 13 basis
points in 2018. Full year 2019 provision for credit losses was $99 million compared to $64 million in 2018. Overall
asset quality continues to be stable quarter over quarter, non-performing assets and net charge-offs decreased.
As of December 31, 2019, classified and criticized assets totaled $974 million compared to $970 million as of
September 30, 2019.
Currently, we estimate that the day one CECL related increase to our allowance for loan losses will be an
increase of approximately 30% from the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2019. Our current outlook
for 2020 projects that the day two provision for credit losses will range between $90 million and $120 million for
2020. This reflects our projected loan growth and our view that asset quality should be broadly similar in 2020 as
in 2019. Further, the range of our provision outlook also takes into account the volatility that we expect to see a
result of the forecast changes during 2020 that will drive the CECL model.
Moving onto capital ratios on slide 13. East West capital ratios are strong. Tangible equity per share of $31.15 as
of December 31, 2019, grew 3% linked quarter and grew by 15% year over year. The tangible equity to tangible

assets ratio increased by 67 basis points year-over-year and our regulatory capital ratios increased by 45 basis
points to 75 basis points year-over-year. East West board of directors has declared first quarter 2020 dividend for
the company's common stock. The common dividend of $0.275 is payable on February 14, 2020 to stockholders
of record on February 3, 2020.
And with, I'll move on to reviewing our 2020 outlook on slide 14. For the full year of 2020 compared to our full year
2019 results, we expect end of period loans to increase by 7% to 8%. We expect that the GAAP net interest
margin will range between 3.40% and 3.45%. Our outlook incorporates no change to the fed funds rate in 2020.
With this outlook for loan growth and net interest margin and reflecting the decline in interest rates in the second
half of 2019 as well as declining accretion income in 2020, we expect that net interest income in 2020 will range
from flat to growth of 2% year-over-year. We expect noninterest expense excluding the amortization of tax credit
and investments and core deposit premiums to increase approximately 4%. We anticipate that the provision for
credit losses will range between $90 million and $120 million.
Finally, we project that the effective tax rate will be approximately 15% for 2020 as we expect to continue to invest
in tax credit investments. We expect to make approximately $100 million of historic and clean energy tax credit
investments in 2020 and project an amortization rate of approximately 85%. For the first quarter of 2020 we
currently expect tax credit amortization will be approximately $20 million.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Dominic for closing remarks.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today
comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.

Good morning.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess just first question, Dominic, you talked about just the impact from the China trade dispute on the
wholesale trade portfolio and there's been enough conversation on whether – how meaningful that impact has
been on your C&I growth, would love to get your sort of thoughts on how you expect 2020 to play out for the C&I
lending, both in terms of the specialty lending verticals where East West has been focused on and in terms of
geographies and all the hiring that you've done, are you going into new markets like what's going to be in your
view driving growth on the C&I side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
At this point I think that we expect the growth comes from many different industry verticals and then the general
C&I and also of course including Greater China and our cross-border business and we feel that in general, there
are different pockets of areas that would grow stronger than the others but the overall economic condition based
on more clarity with this US-China dispute that result in the phase 1 signing, gives many of the business and our
customers more comfort to start investing and growing the business and in addition to that, when you look at the
agreement, they were signed, which called for China buying $200 billion more of goods from the United States
from the baseline of 2017 and that is $77 billion from 2020 and $123 billion in 2021 in the various sectors
including manufacturing, energy and services, et cetera. And we feel that clearly there are opportunities for some
of our clients who are exporting to China and East West is going to pay attention to those opportunities to make
sure that we get our share of banking business. So, all-in-all I would say that 2020 particularly in the second half
and 2021 is looking pretty promising.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just I guess on a separate topic you mentioned investments in the forex platform in Hong Kong and in
the consumer digital platform here. Where should we see the benefits on the upsides of all those investments? Is
it in higher fee revenue or in better deposit growth and just kind of – should we expect these to be needle movers
in terms of growth?

Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Both. I mean like obviously for the FX new system it will be predominantly for fee income. But keep in mind, when
we have a strong FX value proposition that can be a lead in for us to get a commercial banking business which
will then result in loans and deposit too. Now, but that's more indirect, I think the direct part will be fee income.
From the digital banking side, that's really predominantly focused on our consumer, our core customer base and
so for that I think we'll be a consumer core deposits. Interest bearing checking account, noninterest-bearing
checking account so forth. And we expect that there will be more core deposits coming and that will be in the next
few years.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks for the question. I'm interested in credit quality I assume for a pretty notably sequentially, there are
some concerns I believe on residual effects of the energy stress in the third quarter. Could you provide maybe an
update on what you're seeing in that portfolio maybe trending in classifieds. And I believe there was a notable
bankruptcy early in the quarter. I'm wondering if that's kind of been addressed in the current reserve. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, Chris. So if we look at the energy portfolio, just to answer your question specifically, the problem loans that
we identified earlier in the year and talked about in a little bit more detail on the last earnings call. I think the good
news is, there really hasn't been a lot of new problem loans that have been identified. The one loan that you are
referring to was downgraded and in our view is appropriately reserved for in the fourth quarter. In total, if you look
at the balances as of September end of kind of actually the other outstanding balances as of the end of
September for criticized and classified assets was about $68 million. And as of the end of December that was
$130 million non-accrual loans same kind of levels for September were $21 million versus $33 million as of the
end of December. Hopefully that helps to clarify some of those questions you had, Chris.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah, looking at the growth expectations – the loan growth expectations for 2020 of 7% to 8%. Does that assume
that the wholesale trade business balances stay under pressure and if we saw more a phase 2 or more
confidence on the consumer or on the customer side, could you see loan growth potentially be higher than that
with the resumption of stronger wholesale trade lending?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I think that we expect a positive turnaround hopefully sometime 2020 and – but now, we have to keep in
mind is that it's going to be a gradual process and if you looked at, as I indicated in my remarks earlier, in fact
normally in the fourth quarter where we have a surge of the wholesale trade portfolio balances and but last
quarter we actually [ph] did (00:36:54) and it's because everybody's holding out, everyone knew that our
President will be assigning a phase 1 and so we all sort of stand in a sideline and then so why do something until
we see what exactly is going to be signed on and now that once we get that clarity I think people is going to start
focusing on what need to be done, some got great benefit because exporter to China, some also even as importer
because of the – the agreement of not putting tariff on those particular products or the agreement to drop from
15% to 7.5% that helps and then while others are basically stay the same at that 25% tariff.
Now the fact is even for those still have to pay tariff. I mean in a way the good news is that now they know it's not
jumping to 35% or 40% or 50% or is not having the very high uncertainty that's going on [indiscernible] (00:38:05)
from coming from our President and so forth. So in that standpoint, people had dealt with those tariff and manage
it for the last two years and many of them have managed it pretty well in terms of whether its cutting costs a little
bit here and there, having the Chinese government to provide tax credit – tax subsidy or just pass right through to
US consumers and US consumers also seem to be taking those pass through very nicely, as we've seen in the
retail report for the fourth quarter so far.
So all-in-all I see that there will be a little bit more normalization of trade activity going on in 2020, it's going to take
a few months to ramp up and so I would expect that in the first two quarters we shouldn't be expecting a whole lot
of substantial growth, but then we'll be more or less maybe like last year but then in the third quarter and fourth
quarter it ought to be picking up, that's what I see in the trade side. But for the other portfolio I think we'll be more
or less of people looking at the general US economy. That I think clearly with the uncertainty of trade dispute by
the way is not just with China but also with many of the other countries have caused concern for many US
business.
And now when the business overall see what the overall interest rate climate plus some of these settlements of
the trade tariffs and so forth, I think in general the business sentiment is getting a little bit more comfortable. So
we hope that the other C&I verticals that we have moved hopefully also be picking up a little bit. So that's the
assumption that we have and in terms of looking at 2020 outlook and beyond.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, thanks. And just circling back on the – on capital management. I know this is something I've asked on other
calls, but capital continues to grow, the TCE ratio is still growing at a substantial level. What else should we be
thinking about in terms of capital management, with the growth in the similar range as we saw in 2019 I guess
why not come in and do a buyback and help manage capital at this point.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think in this, I would reiterate what we share. I think, I guess in a more than two conference calls before that.
Well, first and foremost we are a management team that are shareholders friendly including our board by the way.
So we constantly at our board meetings evaluate and review this sort of opportunity cost of our capital. Shall we
shall we not buy back. And that I'm pretty sure in our next board meeting we'll have another very detailed
discussion of this sort of alternative out there versus buyback, one of the things that we do looked at though is
that as we just shared in this earnings call, we have well above industry average, return of asset and return of
equity. Our loan growth you know last year average loan growth is about 10% and so we're still doing pretty well
and the other interesting part is that with this new dynamic that we are seeing right now that China has signed
agreement in terms of better protect intellectual property and better protect companies who let's say are being
pushed to transfer technology. And China now have mechanism in place to penalize state-owned enterprises or
any government entities to do that.
So when we see there is a better clarity in these laws that attract foreign investment, when the Vice Minister just
announced at how much China wanted to attract foreign direct investments and in fact foreign direct investments
in China even in 2019 have grown by a few percent and all of those are indications that we at East West Bank
wanted to make sure, while we are looking at the obvious good choice of potential capital buyback, we also need
to balance to see that it is unlikely there'll be great opportunity, what is in the US or in Greater China, that we
would – we wanted to fully invest to ensure we have an even stronger sustainable profitable performance for
many years to come and I can only reflect back in the last 10 years, we have deliberately spent our capital into
investing in people and infrastructure, which allow us to build such a very diverse loan portfolio and deposit
portfolio so that allow at any particular time and year that if some particular sector slowdown the other sectors
picked up. There are not many banks in the country that have a very evenly spread of C&I, CRE and residential
consumer portfolio that spray out very nicely in different categories and allow us to put lever at different time. We
would like to continue to further diversify our loan portfolio, improve our fee income, et cetera. And so we'll
continue to make those investments. But at any point of time, we feel that even with those investments and we
still have excess capital that is redundant that obviously we will step in and start making a buyback. So that's the
plan.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thank you for the question. The derivatives business was obviously a great quarter – great couple of quarters
here with the Fed probably done. Should we be looking for this to kind of tail off or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, Brock. So if you look at 2019 from a customer revenue perspective, the revenue from interest rate
contracts and other derivatives was $42 million net of the CVA adjustment rounding there at $40 million.
When we look at 2020, although we're confident that we will be able to grow fee income line items from all other
categories just given the nature of the rate curve, the inversion earlier this year that really supported the volume
increase we had in the third quarter in particular and second quarter. We don't expect this level of customer
revenue in 2020 for IRC.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got you. Got you. Okay. And separately as you can imagine CECL is providing all sorts of fun with numbers for
analysts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
But not for you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And as I look at your reserve at the true-up and what you're anticipating for provisions. Can you help us
dimension what you may be looking at in terms of charge-offs is a number of 20 basis points, is that reasonable to
expect going forward or too high?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So Brock, that's a great question. And I want to just kind of caution. No, this is our view today for the day
one reserve. You know actually that may change as our models change or forecasts change. And there's some
finalization that we're still doing particular on the qualitative factors. But given the call, we wanted to share what
our views were today and that is that 30% increase from the year-end in current model calculation. On day two,
we have traditionally given the guidance on the provision for the full year. As you probably have noted, the range
that we're providing for the provision is wider. And that's largely given our kind of views that compared to the
incurred model likelihood is that there'll be more volatility on the provision over the course of the year, driven by
kind of changes to the forecast.
So that's certainly that we're factoring, overall when we look at the credit environment, we think it'll be relatively
the same and with those numbers, we're modeling in kind of gross charge-offs at similar levels to 2019 if that's
helpful for you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Young with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hey good morning thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the sort of loan-to-deposit ratio, I know
Dominic, you mentioned that you wanted to continue to operate within the 90% to 95% range but given kind of
where rates are and the stability here, do you think that you'd allow that maybe to drift higher as it may be easier
to put on new deposits at lower rates now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, I think first and foremost we always want to ensure that we have enough liquidity, right, and that we have
enough core deposits to fund our loan growth. That franchise value for a bank is that core deposit franchise. So
that range that we have, the 90% to 95% is a range that we're comfortable with, at this point in time I do not think
we'll inch that up much higher and to kind of more specifically address your question if we have the opportunity to
13

reduce kind of – bring on additional deposits at a lower cost, what we'll probably do with that is let some of the
higher operating cost – operating – higher cost deposits run out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. And then as a follow-up I think at the beginning of last year you had mentioned a couple of demand
deposits, focused initiatives, particularly on the consumer side. I just wanted to get an update if any of those were
moving ahead or if we've seen any benefits from those at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
It went really well in 2019 and so with that momentum we will continue in 2020. So our consumer banking team,
specific the retail branches are all geared up to keep going out there and bringing in small business customers
one at a time. And then we opened many, many accounts last year. And I expect them to continue to use their
center of influence to help them, CTA lawyers and so forth to help them to continue to open the small business
account one at a time.

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning, Gary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
I want to ask a question or a question on 2020 loan growth outlook maybe a little different way. If we look at 2019,
the end of period year-over-year loan growth was a little over 6% and certainly pressured in the fourth quarter by
not having wholesale trade benefit that you typically do. So, Dominic, given your comments about a better outlook
for the back half of the year on wholesale trade as there's some more clarity for your customers why wouldn't that
normalization maybe for 2020 help a better more positive rebound in overall loan growth. Is it expectation of a
slowdown or slower pace of growth in the other loan segments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I think that overall what we projected right now is based on our current activity and we do expect that some
of this sort of positive momentum is going to take a little bit of time to ramp up. So therefore and right now we
prudently projected to be 7% to 8%. Obviously, we'll revise our guidance if we actually see even stronger
momentum going forward.

Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi thanks. A couple of questions for you. So the first one, I wanted to follow up on energy, are you planning to
grow the energy book or do you or conversely do you plan to reduce or exit this portfolio given the credit issues?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
At this point, I don't think there is any hot – and it's going to be a very low likelihood of any growth. The reason is
because, obviously as everyone know in the industry that you know the equity investors are hard to find in these
days. So therefore in order for us to do good deals, we need to have strong equity partners to have us to put on
senior debt, who quite frankly at this point right now, I think the likelihood of what's growing is very to very low, I
think that there will be a higher likelihood we probably reduce the portfolio just naturally because of some pay
down and so forth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Thanks for that. And then shifting gears more of a housekeeping question that you mentioned about the guidance
for tax credit amortization expense. You said $20 million for the first quarter and you gave the full year amount,
but do you happen to have any guidance for the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We do not at this point, but you have full year number and that will help you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q

Yep, thank you.

Well, thank you all for joining the call. First I wanted to apologize for a little bit of a confusion of my remarks earlier
because my mind is already gone to celebrating the Chinese New Year that will be coming this Saturday by the
way, this is a very, very special year, the Year of the Golden Rat is one of the – one out of every 60 year that
would happen, it's the longest year ever for Chinese New Year because it's 384 days and there are a lot of
special days throughout this year, which I will see that many of our customers who have weddings, gave births
and are starting new business, et cetera, et cetera. So East West Bank is going to be busy and so we hope that
this most auspicious year that happens only once every 60 years will bring better fortune and success to
everyone around the world and on behalf of all my associates at East West Bank, I would like to wish you all
happy Lunar New Year, thank you.
