Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. As we all know, 2020 was a very trying year and I
could not be more proud of the unwavering commitment of our team to serve our customers, communities and
each other during this unprecedented time. It has been truly remarkable. When I assumed the role of Chairman in
January, the fundamentals of the economy were strong. And I was looking forward to working with our executive
team to execute our relationship banking strategy. Then in March, our focus shifted due to COVID.
Despite the many challenges the pandemic posed, we have proven our resilience and achieved many important
accomplishments along the way. This includes the bank and the Comerica Charitable Foundation together
providing $11 million of assistance to local communities and businesses. We funded $3.9 billion in PPP loans to
small and medium-sized companies. We were able to quickly enable the majority of our employees to work
remotely and introduce programs to provide support such as Promise Pay and dependent care stipends.
As consumers' desire to utilize digital channels increased, we enhanced our online capabilities for deposit
accounts as well as loan originations. Also, we achieved our 2020 environmental goals set in 2012 to
meaningfully reduce our water, waste, paper and GHG emissions. Our commitment to corporate responsibility
was recognized, including receiving high marks from Newsweek, DiversityInc, Civic 50, CDP and Corporate

Knights. The compassion and tireless efforts of our colleagues across the bank has allowed Comerica to
persevere and remain in a strong position as we move forward.
Slide 4 provides a review of our 2020 financial results which included solid loan performance and a record level of
deposits. This growth, combined with prudent management of loan and deposit pricing and action we took to
deploy excess liquidity, helped offset the pressure of rates dropping to ultra-low levels. In light of the swift
deterioration of the economy, we significantly increased our credit reserve and took a large provision in the first
quarter. While we saw some negative credit migration through the year, it has been manageable and our net
charge-offs for the year were 38 basis points, or 14 basis points excluding Energy, a true testament to our
relationship banking strategy and deep credit experience.
Card fees and securities trading income were strong, while other fees such as deposit service charges and
commercial lending fees were impacted by the slowdown in economic activity. Expenses remained well-controlled
and included COVID-related costs. We maintained our strong capital levels and our book value grew 7% to over
$55 per share. In summary, a solid performance particularly considering the difficult environment.
Our fourth quarter performance is outlined on slide 5. We generated earnings of $215 million or $1.49 per share,
a 3% increase over the third quarter, driven by an increase in revenue and strong credit quality. Compared to the
third quarter, loans essentially performed as we expected. While lower on a quarter-over-quarter basis, average
loans increased in December [ph] rather to (04:49) November by nearly $300 million, excluding PPP loan
repayments. Our loan pipeline continued to grow through the year to pre-COVID levels at year-end.
Average deposits increased by nearly $1.5 billion to an all-time high, with 55% of the growth derived from
noninterest-bearing accounts. Customers continue to prudently manage their cash, cutting costs and reducing
leverage. Yet, they remain cautiously optimistic that the economy will pick up in the back half of this year.
Net interest income increased $11 million, benefiting from our continued careful management of loan and deposit
pricing, combined with the contribution from fees related to PPP loan forgiveness. This was partly offset by lower
loan balances. In addition, lower yields on our securities portfolio were mostly offset by actions we took in the third
quarter to deploy a portion of excess liquidity by increasing the size of the portfolio.
As far as credit, our metrics remain strong and our provision was a credit of $17 million. Criticized loans declined
and net charge-offs were only 22 basis points. Positive portfolio migration and a slight improvement in the
economic forecasts resulted in a reduction of the credit reserve to just under $1 billion or nearly 3 times
nonperforming assets. Through the cycles, our credit performance relative to the industry has been a key
differentiator and I believe we will continue to outperform. Noninterest income increased $13 million or 5%, as
customer activity continued to rebound. This included strong derivative income and commercial lending fees.
We continue to maintain our expense discipline as we invest for the future. While expenses were higher in the
fourth quarter, this was primarily driven by performance incentives as well as outside process related to our card
platform. Our capital levels remain strong. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.35%, above our target of 10%. As
always, our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive
return to our shareholders.
And now, I will turn the call over to Jim.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 6. Average loans decreased approximately $600
million, or 1%, which compared favorably to the industry H8 data. Loans in Corporate Banking and general Middle
Market decreased, as customers are performing well, prudently managing their business to increase cash flow
and reduce debt. For the fourth consecutive quarter, Energy loans decreased and are at the lowest level since
2011. The US rig count is less than half of what it was a year ago, however, it has been gradually increasing since
late summer as oil prices began to recover. Technology and Life Sciences loans declined about $180 million
mainly due to M&A and increased liquidity, driven by fundraising activity and companies reducing cash burn.
Equity Fund Services, which provides capital call lines to investment companies, increased $244 million as
activity has picked up with new fund formation. National Dealer increased $190 million, as inventory levels are
slowly rebuilding, yet remains $2 billion below fourth quarter 2019. Mortgage Banker reached a new record with
strong activity in both refi and home sales.
Period-end loans were stable and included a decline in PPP balances of $298 million, primarily due to loan
forgiveness. Line utilization at year-end for the total portfolio remained relatively low at 48%. Loan yields
increased 7 basis points with accelerated fees from PPP forgiveness and continued pricing actions, particularly
adding LIBOR floors when possible as loans renew.
Average deposits increased 2%, or $1.5 billion, to a new record of $70.2 billion as shown on slide 7. The largest
driver continues to be noninterest-bearing deposits and growth has been broad-based, with increases in nearly
every business line. Customers continue to conserve and maintain excess cash balances.
Period-end deposits increased over $4.4 billion. Timing of monthly benefit activity in our government prepaid card
business increased balances by $2.2 billion at quarter-end. However, this does not include the latest stimulus
payments which were received in early January. With strong deposit growth, our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased
to 72%. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits reached an all-time low of 11 basis points, a decrease of 6
basis points from the third quarter; and our total funding costs fell to only 10 basis points.
As you can see on slide 8, the average balance of the securities portfolio increased. This was due to the third
quarter purchase of $2.25 billion in additional securities, primarily treasuries, as we took some action to put some
of our excess liquidity to work. The additional securities combined with lower rates on the replacement of prepays
which totaled about $1 billion, resulted in the yield on the portfolio declining to 1.95%. We expect repayments of
MBS to continue to be about $1 billion per quarter and yields on reinvestments to be in the low-to-mid 100 basis-
point range.
Turning to slide 9, net interest income increased $11 million to $469 million and the net interest margin was up 3
basis points to 2.36%. Interest income on loans increased $6 million, adding 4 basis points to the margin. Higher
fees mostly related to PPP loan forgiveness and continue pricing actions as loans renew, together added $10
million and 4 basis points to the margin. Other portfolio dynamics including higher non-accrual income, added $1
million. The decrease in loans had a $5 million unfavorable impact.
Lower securities yields had a $6 million or 3 basis point negative impact. This was mostly offset by the higher
balance which added $5 million. Average balances of the Fed increased over $500 million impacting the margin
by 1 basis point. Our extraordinarily high Fed balances of $13 billion continue to weigh heavily on the margin with
a gross impact of approximately 43 basis points.
Finally, prudent management and deposit pricing added $5 million and 3 basis points to the margin, and lower
rates on wholesale funding added $1 million. Given the nature of our portfolio, our loans re-priced very quickly as
5


Comerica, Inc.
(CMA) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
rates dropped earlier last year, so the bulk of the impact from lower rates has been absorbed. Also, while deposit
rates are at record lows, we continue to manage deposit pricing with a closed eye on the competitive environment
and our liquidity position.
Overall, credit quality was strong as shown on slide 10. Gross charge-offs were only $39 million, a decrease of
$14 million from the third quarter. Net charge-offs were $29 million or 22 basis points. Nonperforming assets
increased $24 million, yet remain below our historical norm at 69 basis points of total loans.
Inflows to nonaccrual were about half of the amount of the third quarter and the lowest level of any quarter since
the pandemic began. Criticized loans declined $459 million and comprised 6% of the total portfolio. We believe
our disciplined underwriting and diverse portfolio are assisting us in managing through the pandemic conditions.
Positive migration in the portfolio combined with a modestly improved economic outlook resulted in a small
decrease in our allowance for credit losses. As the path to full economic recovery remains uncertain due to the
unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, our reserve ratio remains elevated at 1.90% or 2.03%
excluding PPP loans. We're well-positioned with a relatively high credit reserve and overall improving credit
quality.
Slide 11 provides detail on segments that we believe pose higher risk in the current environment. Period-end
loans in the social distancing segment declined slightly. Criticized loans were stable and nonaccruals remain
under 1%. This segment has performed better than expected, but issues can be lumpy and sudden and resulted
in net charge-offs of $21 million in the fourth quarter. The new round of PPP will certainly be helpful for customers
that are challenged by the current environment.
Energy loans decreased 13% to $1.6 billion at quarter end, representing 3% of our total loans. Oil prices have
increased and credit quality has improved with reductions in criticized, nonaccruals and net charge-offs. We have
seen a little more capital markets activity and fall redeterminations resulted in only a slight decrease in borrowing
bases due to lower reserves. Additional information can be found in the appendix. While we're pleased with the
performance of these segments, we have applied a more severe economic forecast to them and believe we are
well reserved.
Noninterest income increased $13 million as outlined on slide 12, continuing the positive trend we've seen since
post the shutdown of the economy earlier last year. Fourth quarter includes increased customer activity in most
categories. Customer derivative income increased $8 million with higher volume due to interest rate swaps and
energy hedges, combined with a change in the impact from the credit valuation adjustment. Specifically, there is
an unfavorable adjustment of $6 million in the third quarter and a favorable adjustment of less than $1 million in
the fourth quarter.
Commercial lending fees increased $5 million with the seasonal pickup in syndication activity and higher
unutilized line fees. We had smaller increases in fiduciary, foreign exchange, and letters of credit. Also, card fees
remained very strong due to government card and merchant activity spurred by the economic stimulus and
changes in customer behavior related to the COVID environment. Securities trading income which includes fair
market adjustments for investments we hold related to our Technology and Life Sciences business, decreased $5
million from elevated levels generated over the last couple quarters. Note, deferred comp asset returns were $9
million, a $1 million increase from the third quarter and are offsetting noninterest expenses. All in all, a strong
quarter for fee income.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
Turning to expenses on slide 13, salaries and benefits increased $14 million with higher performance-based
incentives, severance, staff insurance expense, and technology-related labor. Note that on a full-year basis,
salary and benefit expense was stable with a reduction in incentive compensation, offsetting annual merit, higher
deferred comp and COVID-related costs. We realized a $7 billion increase in outside processing due to card
activity, technology spend as well as PPP program costs.
Occupancy increased $2 million due to a catch up in maintenance projects that were delayed due to COVID as
well as seasonal expenses. There is also a seasonal increase in advertising expense. Our strong expense
discipline is well ingrained and is assisting us in navigating the slow rate environment as we invest for the future.
Our capital levels remain strong as shown on slide 14. Our CET1 ratio increased to an estimated 10.35% of our
target of 10%. As always, our priority is to use our capital to support our customers drive growth, while providing
an attractive return to our shareholders. In this regard, we've maintained a very competitive dividend yield.
As far as share repurchases, we have a long track record of actively managing our capital and returning excess
capital generated to shareholders. As we sit here today, a great deal of uncertainty remains about the ultimate
pace of the economic recovery whether it be faster or slower than economists' forecasts. For that reason, we
have paused for share repurchases and look forward to restarting the program as soon as we deem it prudent to
do so.
Slide 15 provides our outlook for the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, as well as some color on the year
ahead. In the first quarter, we expect National Dealer loans to continue to increase at a moderate pace as auto
inventory rebuilds. Also, Middle Market is expected to grow as a result of increased economic activity. However,
this will be more than offset by Mortgage Banker declining from its record high due to seasonally lower purchase
and refi volumes. Energy is expected to decrease due to higher oil prices driving improved cash flow and capital
markets activity.
As far as PPP loans, we expect the pace of loan forgiveness could potentially exceed the second round of
fundings. Looking past the first quarter, excluding PPP loan activity and based on improving economic conditions,
we expect loans to grow throughout the year. We expect average deposits to remain strong in the first quarter as
customers continue to carefully manage their liquidity. As far as net interest income, continued management of
loan and deposit pricing is expected to be accretive, albeit to a lesser degree than we've seen so far.
We are currently in the process of deploying some excess liquidity by repaying $2.8 billion of FHLB advances
over an eight-week period, which will provide a modest lift. These benefits are expected to be more than offset by
reduced loan balances, lower yields and securities, slightly lower LIBOR as well as two fewer days in the quarter.
As we move through the year, assuming there's no change from rates that we experienced in the fourth quarter,
we expect quarterly pressure on securities yields and swap maturities to be mostly offset by loan growth
excluding PPP impacts.
We expect net charge-offs to increase from low levels we've seen recently. However, with our credit reserve at
year-end at over 2% of loans excluding PPP, we believe we are well positioned to manage through this period of
economic uncertainty. We expect non-interest income in the first quarter to benefit from higher deposit service
charges, fiduciary, and brokerage fees. As deferred comp is difficult to predict, we assume it will not be repeated.
We expect a seasonal decline in syndication activity. Also, card, warrants and securities trading income are
expected to decline from elevated levels.
As we progressed through the year, we believe that customer-driven fee categories in general should grow with
improving economic conditions. We expect expenses to be lower in the first quarter. Our pension expense is
7

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
expected to decline $9 million in the first quarter to get to the new run rate for 2021. The decline is primarily due to
strong investment performance in 2020. As I mentioned, we do not forecast deferred comp of $9 million to repeat.
Also, marketing and occupancy expenses are expected to be seasonally lower and there are two less days in the
quarter.
Partly offsetting all of this, first quarter includes annual stock comp and associated higher payroll taxes. We
remain focused on maintaining our expense discipline while we invest in the future. Therefore, on a full-year
basis, we expect higher salary expense related to normal merit and incentive comp as well as higher tax spend,
will be mostly offset by lower pension and deferred comp returns. We expect a 22% tax rate excluding discrete
items.
Finally, as mentioned in the previous slide, we remain focused on maintaining our strong capital levels and
providing an attractive return to the shareholders.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Curtis Chatman Farmer
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. While difficult and uncertain conditions persist, I am confident that our team will continue to adapt
and thrive as we have over the past year. We expect the economy will improve in 2021. We believe firming trade
and manufacturing conditions, increasing business and consumer confidence as well as pent-up demand, will
support solid economic growth particularly in the back half of the year.
Comerica has a long history of successfully managing through challenging times. We have demonstrated our
resiliency and unwavering dedication to provide a high level of customer service, as we navigate the COVID
pandemic. We maintain a culture that drives continuous efficiency improvement. We believe this will assist us in
preserving our cost base as the economy improves and we continue to invest in our future.
Our disciplined credit culture and strong capital base continues to serve us well. Utilizing our deep expertise and
experience to help our customers navigate these difficult times builds and solidifies long-term relationships. These
key strengths provide the foundation to continue to deliver a long-term shareholder value. This has been
demonstrated by our ROE which increased over 11% in the fourth quarter and our book value per share which
grew 7% over the past year as well as the current dividend yield which remains above 4%.
Thank you for your time. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Terry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe start with the outlook for loans, I believe you said about $300 million of loan
growth you experienced or saw in December. How much of that was within general Middle Market? And I'm just
trying to get behind some of your optimism about growth in that portfolio at least in the early part and throughout
2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director, Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Hey, Terry. It's Peter. Thanks for the question. Yeah, the month of December was felt really good, it actually felt
like kind of pre-COVID environment. I don't know that I would say that it was robust, per se though, in general
Middle Market or our general business banking businesses. Those businesses continue to do really well, but we
saw a little more of our momentum, I think, in some of our specialty businesses than just pure middle market.
Now that said, I do feel good about sort of where the pipeline is going into the year. We're encouraged by what we
are seeing in that segment. And hopefully, the first quarter will be a little bit better than what we've been seeing in
this COVID world. So again, I think that most of our general businesses are still – have this headwind of a – that
you're seeing with COVID across the country making it a little challenging.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. And then as a follow up, I just saw that the severance expenses on slide 13 were [ph] at least (00:24:24)
higher in the fourth quarter. Could you just talk, is there internally a plan to maybe reduce the head count and
focus on expenses? And I know you talked about the first quarter expense trends. Any thoughts on full-year 2021
core expense growth kind of netting out some of the moving parts that we see quarter-to-quarter? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Terry. This is Jim. Thanks for the question. Regarding the severance that we had in the fourth quarter, I
would say that that was specifically targeted in certain areas just to restructure and make sure that we had the
right staffing both to fit the skillsets that we need in certain areas and also it's part of some of the transition we've
had with new leaders. So it's really more optimizing our org structure as opposed to an expense reduction play.
Regarding just core expenses going forward, I'll just say that we clearly had some expenses in the fourth quarter
that elevated our run rate. And I certainly would not look at the fourth quarter as an example of what the run rate
will be going forward. As we look into the full year for 2021, as we mentioned in the opening remarks, I do expect
that lower pension expense and deferred comp will mostly offset merit, tax spend and a little bit of a reset of stock

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
comp, given the COVID year that we had this year. So we'd expect expenses just to be slightly up on a year-to-
year basis.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Morning, Ken.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Good morning, everyone. Question in terms of provision guidance, so obviously I see it's reflective of the
economy, but I guess my two questions on this. What does your economic model expect to happen that you're
building in for your provision? And if that does play out as you expect, how do you see provision expense trending
going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Hey, Ken. This is Melinda. Thanks for the question. I mean, obviously the small reserve release that we had this
quarter was really reflective of the really strong credit performance of the portfolio and modestly continuing to
improve economic forecast. We use a variety of forecast in the CECL provisioning process that go through
different scenarios, including recovery as well as some additional stress in the more stressed scenarios.
Assuming no material change to the credit profile, which based on all the factors that we see today, we're not
expecting any material credit deterioration and that the macro economic outlook stays stable to slightly –
continuing to improve as we go throughout 2021, and probably most importantly, that the current level of
uncertainty has started to abate, i.e., we get past the next couple of months of this COVID resurgence, the
vaccine rollout accelerates and the efficacy is proven out. Reserve levels are definitely going to come down. It's
impossible to tell you exactly how that's going to play out. As you know, CECL is a very complex accounting
exercise that we go through each quarter. But we expect to be moving towards pre-COVID levels over the course
of 2021 and perhaps into the early part of 2022.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right. No, that's very helpful. And then just a follow-up question. In terms of the accelerated PPP fees, can you
just clarify again how are you accounting for the anticipated accelerated fees in your NII guidance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Ken, we exclude PPP from that guidance since it is unpredictable in terms of where it would go. When I
look at PPP, we noted that we had pretty strong fees in the fourth quarter, the majority of which that increase was
PPP. I would expect in the first quarter that amount of accelerated fees to about double from the increase that we
saw in the fourth quarter. And I wouldn't necessarily expect overall PPP income to double in first quarter
compared to fourth just because the rate of loan forgiveness will probably exceed the new round two that's
coming on board.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got you. Okay. So when you said – and I think if I heard this correctly, for the full year for NII, I think you were
assuming the lower security yields largely offset by loan growth. So, we assume relatively stable NII [ph] then any
(00:29:00) accelerated PPP fees would be on top of that. So it'd be technically going from flat to something
positive on NII side. Is that the right way of thinking about it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
That is the right way of thinking about it. It'll clearly be higher in 2021 because of accelerated PPP fees, but I was
excluding that for the guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Perfect. All right. Very clear. Thank you very much.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. I wonder if I could just hop over to your commentary on buybacks. I know you indicated that you
plan to remain on the sidelines right now pending some clarity around the macro backdrop. But can you give us a
little bit more detail there like what exactly are you looking for in terms of data points on the macro backdrop to get
you comfortable that you can start to put some of the excess capital to work? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
All right, John. Thanks. This is Jim. When you look at where we're at today, we're actually at the peak of the
COVID pandemic. I think we just had a record in terms of daily deaths in the last week or so. And so, we just think
it's prudent to wait and look for a little more clear line of sight in terms of where this thing is going. We feel like we
already returned a fair amount of capital just due to the relatively stronger dividend we have compared to peers.
We are just looking forward to starting the share buyback.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
But we just think it's prudent to wait to see where things go, because we want to make sure we're there for the
customers should things either take off faster than expected or what we're more focused on is what would happen
if the economy took a step backwards. We needed to be there for our customers and there were some economic
ramifications to the step down. And so, we're just being careful in watching for a clear line of sight and we'll look
forward to starting it at the appropriate time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. All right. Thank you. And then separately on the margin front, I know you don't really give explicit margin
guidance. But just want to get your thoughts on some of the – maybe if you can help us in how to think about the
NIM progression from here given the PPP benefit, but also you've got the steeper curve which is certainly a factor,
but also the expectation and short rates remain low. So I just wanted to see if you can help us with that?
And then secondarily, if you can maybe give us some color on your new money loan yields by portfolio, if you
have that. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. We can answer that in a couple of different ways. I mean, number one, the PPP income will be a little bit
lumpy by quarter. So as I mentioned earlier, we will exclude that from the guidance. Overall, we will have more
PPP income in 2021 certainly than we did in 2020. And as we mentioned during the script, I do expect the impact
from rates. Even though the yield curve has steepened as you point out, we're still adding securities in that low
100-bp range. And so, we are adding securities at a lower rate than what we are running off.
And then on top of that, you'll notice in the appendix we are going to have in the second half of the year some
lumpy treasury maturities as well as some hedges that start to mature not in a big way. But due to all those
factors, we will see a little bit of rate pressure each quarter. And I do see that mostly offsetting or perhaps a little
more than offsetting the loan growth benefit that we get. Now, PPP would be totally separate from that. And
again, we will see some significant amounts of accelerated fee income as the year goes on both due to round one
as well as round two. So hopefully, that helps make it a little bit more clear.

Executive Vice President & Executive Director, Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Go ahead, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Yeah. No, I was just asking about the new money loan yields. If you happen to have that by the different types of
the different loan categories. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
John, as you see from the slide, we've actually been having some pretty good success with our loan yields and
the pricing of new business coming on board. We actually did have a slightly lower LIBOR in the quarter, about
1.5 bps down. You'll notice that due to pricing actions we showed an increase of $3 million just due to pricing
dynamics overcoming that lower LIBOR.
So, you could take away from that that loan yields were holding up quite well. In fact, they're accretive right now.
Now, we don't expect that to continue at that same rate as I mentioned, because there are competitive pressures
and there is a lot of excess liquidity out there. But up until now, they've been holding up quite well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director, Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. John, it's Peter. I would just add, I mean pricing continues to be very competitive out there in the
marketplace. Depending on which line of business you might be talking about, it's maybe more opportunity for us
than others; it just sort of depends. But to Jim's point, I think we've done a really good job of maintaining our
pricing and producing good yields for the bank. And so, so far we've been able to keep doing that and I think we'll
be able to do it going forward.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Good morning. So, I wanted to ask if – assuming that rates stay low at the short end and we get a bit more
steepening, could you give a little bit more color on when you would expect the trajectory of net interest income to
stop declining? And then, I guess within the securities portfolio, if you could discuss what kind of reinvestment
rates you're seeing relative to the 1.95% and maybe a little bit more color on what opportunity a steeper curve
represents, that would be great.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Bill. It's Jim. Thanks for the question. It's really the short rates that drive our net interest income here at
Comerica. And so, even with a little bit more steepening in the yield curve, we are still going to have some
pressure on the securities line. In fact, the 1.95% you mentioned, right now we're adding securities in the low
ones. And so, it would say quite a bit of steep things to head off that deterioration that we're seeing.
And in addition, we are seeing some lumpy maturities with treasuries that you see again in the appendix as well
as swaps and that has quite a delta between what we'd either reinvest those in [ph] or if they just fill (00:35:41) the
cash at the Fed. So, it really would take a change in short-term rates to see any kind of material movement
upward in their ongoing net interest income on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Understood. That's very helpful. And I had a follow-up on expenses and efficiency more broadly if I could. Can we
see a return to positive operating leverage without higher rates, given the dynamics that you were just describing
on net interest income?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Bill, this is Curt. I might just talk a little bit about our sort of income-generating potential and just sort of our outlook
from a growth perspective going forward. And your question was specifically about efficiency ratio, but I might first
just comment that the last two quarters we were able to generate double-digit ROE in what has been a pretty
challenging environment. And we continue to feel really good about our long-term financial model and really – our
long-term financial outlook and our business model.
And as always, we're focused on the things that we can control. We think we've got a very attractive franchise.
We're in a lot of very high growth markets that we do believe should perform better than the US as a whole, as we
come out of the COVID situation and hit the second half of the year. So we do believe that we'll see a higher
customer demand, loan activity, et cetera. And as you know, we've got a lot of depth and expertise in middle
market, business banking, a number of sort of unique businesses.
And beyond just sort of the balance sheet growth opportunity, we continue to maintain a very attractive deposit
base and most financial institutions are flush with deposits right now, but we really feel like what we've got is very
relationship-oriented deposits and we've done a very good job of relationship pricing with those deposits. Credit
continues to do very well. We think we will outperform relative to our peer group in that area in which we think
we're newer, to our overall financial performance.
And then we're very focused on two other things I would mention is just fee income and how we can generate
more fee income as an institution, especially in the card area, treasury management, wealth management. We've
got strong capabilities there. We've been doing a lot to continue to invest in those areas, and we again think that
will help in terms of our overall financial performance. And our expenses were up some for the quarter. We do feel
like that's not necessarily run rate, but just some unique items that hit us in the fourth quarter. And our expense
discipline is very ingrained in our culture, and we're always looking for opportunities to continue to manage tightly
on the expense front.

And then just maybe lastly, as I said in my formal comments, we've made it through lots of different cycles and
this is just another cycle that we're managing through. And as an institution, we have always struck a good
balance between growth and conservative management of our balance sheet and in credit. And we think that will
help us manage through whatever happens in the next three or four months, but position us well longer term
given all of the factors that I just outlined.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Could you give us a little more detail on what you're seeing in the more at-risk portfolios from more
social distancing right now? The credit obviously continues to outperform peers, so just curious as to what you're
seeing below the surface here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Hey, Jennifer. This is Melinda. Thanks for the question. So overall, as you've already sort of highlighted and Jim
and Curt did in their opening comments, I mean we're really pleased with the performance of the portfolio as a
whole. And although these are at-risk industries, they have actually held up I think better than what we would
have expected coming into this. The segment called social distancing specifically are those companies that are
most directly impacted by any social mitigation actions that are taking place.
So obviously, in the near term, given the current coronavirus surging, it's probably the portfolio that we are
watching the closest and probably has the most opportunity for some additional migration. All of these four
portfolios that are listed on slide 11, although they have elevated credit metrics, we have not seen a high level of
migration into the NPA category, which obviously NPAs would need to increase in order to see significantly
increasing losses.
The Energy portfolio, although it has the most stressed credit metrics, actually has stabilized quite nicely. And
certainly, prices at $50 a barrel supply/demand dynamics have changed. And that portfolio, I would call, much
more stabilized even though it has elevated credit metrics. And certainly charge-offs the last two quarters have
shown that we may be through the worst of that. That can change really quickly with energy, obviously given the
commodity nature. So, we are continuing to work with those borrowers.

reserved to handle.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning, everyone. Melinda, question for you, a follow-up to Ken's earlier question on the outlook for
reserve levels. I know you probably hate these questions. But when we think about pre-COVID reserve levels and
I look at slide 10, and I see that 1.33% reserve and I think the day one CECL for you if, I remember correctly, was
basically zero; that may be a positive. Is that the message you're sending when you say pre-COVID levels that we
can head back to those levels by the end of 2021 or early 2022? Is that what you said or did I miss hear that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
No. I think that's fair and accurate. I mean, again, obviously, CECL is a complex accounting exercise and every
single quarter we're going to take the most recent economic forecast in the portfolio – our portfolio and what's
happening in our portfolio. But again, given where the credit metrics are today and the overall improving economic
forecast, particularly for the second half of the year, I think that directionally, yes, we expect to be headed in the
direction of pre-COVID levels.
I can't tell you what that number is; I don't think anybody knows what that number is. I mean, we're in new and
uncharted territory. CECL, obviously, is new. And we've never sort of come out of a recessionary environment,
particularly one as severe as what we experienced in the first and second quarter. But directionally, yes, by the
end of 2021, beginning of 2022, and that could either slow or accelerate based on how quickly the second half of
the year recovery happens.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. That's all fair. And then on the charge-offs, thinking you're saying modest increase. And I guess, is
there anything we should be aware of? I mean, are there any bigger charge-offs coming or bigger problems that
you're worried about, or you just expect maybe some modest increases which I think we probably all have built
into the models? But is there anything you want to flag for us in terms of the longer-term charge-off outlook?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
No. I think what you said that it's really just the modest increases over the particularly low levels that we've seen
in the last couple of quarters. We've obviously also had some nice recoveries. Those are lumpy and difficult to
predict. So, there is nothing in the portfolio that has me overly concerned from a concentration perspective. I
mean, I think that where we'll continue to see charge-offs, honestly, is going to be in those at-risk portfolios and
probably more likely in that social distancing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Then if I can squeeze in one more maybe for Peter. The dealer balances and the trends, how long
do you think it takes to get back to normal and do you think normal is that kind of high $7 billion type balance
range? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director, Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Jon. Thanks. I don't know if normal is the $7 billion. I think getting back to normal is probably harder to
determine than we would like. It's certainly second half of 2021 hopefully. It's just hopefully seeing that business
kind of get back to its normal inventory levels which there's a lot of debate about when or if that's going to happen.
We believe it will happen and we hear from our customers, they believe that that will happen as well.
So, hopefully that that happens in the second part of this year and we certainly – we love that space. We're very
comfortable getting back to the numbers you see in prior quarters on slide 26. And if that can happen into this
year and into next then we'd be very excited about that.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
So Curt, my first question. During this period of low rates and slow growth, we've seen more banks turning to
M&A, right, to drive shareholder value, and it's been quite a while since we've seen Comerica use this tool. As
you think about 2021 priorities, how are you viewing M&A here? And should we expect to see the company get
more active on this front?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Well, Steven, as I have said through the years on these calls and other forums as well, we believe our model
really is built for success on organic growth. We're in great lines of business where we have deep expertise and
scale and in great markets where we still have a lot of room to continue to grow. And so, we're going to be
primarily focused on that.
I do think there's a lot of uncertainty around the environment on a go-forward basis and how the credit cycle will
play out. And so, I don't have a crystal ball as to what M&A activity looks like in 2021, but really no change for us,
focused on organic growth. And we've only done two deals in the last 20 years. We have said repeatedly that if
we were going to look at opportunities, we are probably first and foremost interested in Texas and California,
given the growth dynamics of both of those markets and that a deal would have to make great sort of strategic
and cultural sense for us.
And so, while there've been a number of deals announced last year, that really doesn't change our overall view
and we're going to be a patient acquirer. It doesn't mean that we wouldn't look at opportunities, but again, first and
foremost focused on organic growth. We would, as we have been in the past, be interested in things that are
nonbank acquisitions. So if we have a gap in fee income or we see an opportunity there then those are the types
of things we might look at as well, nothing on the immediate horizon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And for my follow-up, if I could ask you a big picture question. So, one of the impacts that
we've talked about has been, from the pandemic, is this dramatic acceleration, right, the adoption of digital,
consumers, businesses, everybody. Curt, how has this impacted how you view the historical relationship banking
model at the company? And how have your investments in technology changed as you're seeing customers adapt
digital more frequently? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Well, fortunately, I think not only for us, Steve, but for the whole industry, we've all been on this digital journey,
and 2020 in many regards and the COVID situation has accelerated that path as we've seen more migration to
digital and mobile online channels for consumers as well as businesses. We believe that we remain in a well –
well positioned there. We've got a really strong talent on the IT side. And this past year, we recruited a new
Executive Director of Technology & Operations, Megan Crespi; and a new CIO, Bruce Mitchell. And they've been
bringing a lot of new thoughts and ideas to us.
And it's always for us sort of focused on two areas. One is the things that we can do to continue to enable our
customers and provide attractive products and services for our customers. And then secondly, how we use
technology to help reduce expenses across the company; things like AI, et cetera. We talked before about the fact
that we've been on this path of migration to the cloud and are making good progress there.
18


Comerica, Inc.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
And we've also talked about the fact that while we don't necessarily have the same scale as many of our larger
competitors, we can leverage both a good blend of proprietary capabilities with third parties and really achieve
scale where needed if we don't necessarily have it in-house. And there are a number of things that we've got in-
flight right now. We rolled out a new digital onboarding platform last year that will benefit really across all of our
business lines in terms of originating new relationships via mobile and web channels.
We've rolled out a new loan origination platform for our consumer bank. We've done a lot around just how we
leverage data and push data to our employees in terms of customer information. We're making a number of
enhancements to our treasury management platform. And then, we've been going through some upgrades in our
wealth management business line and new trust platform and a new wealth management portal sort of single
sign-on portal for our wealth management clients.
So, I think we remain competitive. We feel good about our positioning. I think it's always important to remember
that we are, first and foremost, primarily a commercial bank and relationships still really matter in that business.
The intellectual capital we bring, the advice we bring, every deal we do is highly customized. It's not something
that you push out over sort of a digital channel. But we've got to have products and services that support the
treasury side of the house, the treasurer or the CFO, et cetera, in that space and we believe we do.
And then even in the other business lines, wealth management and even in our retail bank, we tend to serve a
more affluent client relationship still really important there, advice still really important. But again, enable through a
digital and mobile and other channels as well and we feel like we're well-positioned.

I know you've asked about loan growth and the confidence that it picks up in the second quarter. And the reason I
ask is, we've heard from other banks that there was so much excess liquidity that borrowers would tap that
excess liquidity before drawing down on lines of credit or new loan growth. I just wonder if you could talk about
that.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
Yeah. Peter, this is Peter. I think you'll probably see both of those things. I don't know that I would disagree with
the idea that we probably see some of the liquidity you get used up. I mean we've got very high deposits right now
like all banks, some of the highest we've seen. And so, I suspect that would be part of the turn. And frankly, a
good indicator that loan direction is moving in that – is moving up while deposits are coming down.
So, regardless of – which of those necessarily occurs first, we still feel pretty encouraged that the second half of
the year, based on most of the macro indicators that we're seeing so far, would lead us to believe that we're going
to see a better second half of the year when it comes to loan growth. But I don't think you're necessarily wrong or
I wouldn't disagree with that idea that you would like to see deposits come down first, and I think those together
would directionally be really good for loans.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And Jim, if I could follow-up about the reinvestment pressure on the securities portfolio, would you continue
to shift some of that excess liquidity into securities as maybe as an offset like we saw in the fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Peter. Thanks for the question. That is something that we're going to have to examine on an ongoing basis.
We have been and we are taking incremental steps to invest the excess liquidity, but we're being careful not to
jump in all at once and place a big bet at any one time, given that we just don't know where things were headed.
So as you look at where we've been and where we're going, certainly starting in late second quarter of 2020, third
quarter of 2020, we did prepay a material amount of purchase funds midway through third quarter. And of course,
we bought the $2.75 billion of securities which had a fourth quarter benefit also. And then as I mentioned in the
first quarter of this year, we're prepaying $2.8 billion of FHLB funding.
So, we are attempting to take steps that show some type of benefit each quarter in terms of doing something with
the excess liquidity, but we want to do it in a very measured way. We don't necessarily want to sit on the sidelines
forever, but we don't want to jump in all at once either. And so, you'll see us continue to evaluate as time goes on
and take incremental steps as the quarters go on. And then when there's more of a line of sight, we may take
even a bigger step. But we do think caution is in order, but totally sitting on the sidelines doesn't make sense
either. So, the measured pace is kind of we're managing ourselves to.

pre-COVID. I wonder if you could just give the next level down, was it the conversations with clients? Was it the
pipelines or certain activity metrics you're looking at? What were the things that started to feel like pre-COVID by
the time we got to end of December?

Hey, Brian. It's Peter. And the one I know for sure is just the amount of deals that we approved and looked at in
the month of December that came through the process. And so, that was probably the best indicator that I've had
– that Melinda and I've had together in a while of just what we see at our committees and the amount of activity
we've had. So, that was encouraging.
Now, end of the year is always busy. You're always going to sort of see that. But it certainly felt like a pre-COVID
better than we'd certainly seen in the last 60, 90 days. And one thing I continue to say about the pipeline is that it
feels and the numbers look good. They look pre-COVID. What is less certain is just the timing of some of this.
And so much of it right now is M&A. It's dividend recaps. It's not necessarily core requests that companies have
for CapEx or things like that.
So, it's a little bit lumpy, but it does feel better than it did certainly 90 days ago. It's just still a little bit hard to
determine when exactly all of that's going to happen. So, hopefully that gives you a little double-click down, Brian,
as to what you were looking for.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everybody. Hey. Thank you for taking the question. I think most of mine have been hit, but I just
wanted to ask one question just on the mortgage banker portfolio. Obviously, it's been kind of swollen by the huge
mortgage market we had over the course of the past year or so. Just I guess, I'm curious where that ends up
settling out since there's so much error between where it started and where it is now. I guess, the both cases that
you guys as sort of a strong market share player would retain more of those balances as originations for the
industry kind of normalized. But just curious how you guys see that playing out.

Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director, Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Scott, it's Peter. Thank you. Slide 23 in the appendix has our mortgage banker outlook for originations in
2021. And I think we've usually used that as an indicator of what we think the year is going to be, as Jim
indicated. It'll be a little bit of a headwind on loan balances. But overall, we think the sort of annual cycle you see
in that business continues to lift for us, if you will, a little bit. We continue to add new names. We love the space.
We've been in it a long, long time. We think we're a very important player in it.

And so, I think when you look at the outlook for the MBA forecast, that sort of gives you an idea of what I think
we're going to see. But we also feel like we are increasing our customer count and our opportunities in that space,
and we'll continue to do so in the coming quarters and years.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Brock.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a follow-up to Steve's question regarding technology. I think an
ironic benefit of COVID, if you call it that, is that it does allow kind of a reanalysis, reexamination of the entire
delivery structure. You have seen banks – some banks kind of attack their branch structure more aggressively to
pay for or fund some of the tech investments. Is that a direction that you may potentially pursue in the future as
your new tech team settles in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Brock, just a couple of comments around our branch network. First of all, just from a size standpoint we have
roughly 435 banking centers. So we don't have the same sort of scale that some players have and we have less
redundancy in markets. So you're not going to drive down the street and see two Comerica banking centers
across the street from each other. And so, we've kind of eliminated any sort of redundancy in the platform and feel
pretty good about the network we have overall.
Having said that, just like all financial services firms, we have been selectively continuing to prune that portfolio.
We've been changing the configuration in the banking centers. We've been leveraging technology more, doing
away with things like traditional teller lines, having more sort of universal bankers in the banking center that can
handle all things for clients whether it's a loan or deposit need or whatever advisory type capabilities we need to
deliver. And that's allowed us to reduce head count in the banking centers over time and reduce the FTEs and the
banking centers.
And so, I do think that that trend of just sort of continued slowly, decreasing the size of the number of banking
centers will continue. But I don't think you should expect necessarily that we're going to announce some huge
restructuring of our banking center platform. We have other ways, I think, to continue to fund our technology
journey and we've been able to do that within our overall expense base.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And more broadly and I know this is difficult given the uncertainty of COVID, but on the back of that do you
have any sense you can give us sort of how we should think about the efficiency – the efficiency ratio and where
that could potentially run?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Brock, that's going to be dependent upon, number one, where the economy goes and where interest rates go.
That will be a big driver and I think we're in a little bit of uncharted territory here. But in the meanwhile, we are
focused on all those things that we can control. I would echo Curt's comments in terms of some of the things
we're doing on the technology side.
We do focus on efficiencies on an ongoing basis and we do plan leveraging technology both in terms of the IA to
make departments more efficient as well as the distribution systems, whether that be in the commercial banking
side with treasury management systems or the banking centers that you mentioned.
So, we'll continue to take steps to refine how we approach distribution model and the overall expense base and
the revenue will be somewhat driven over the next two or three years by the rate environment. In the meanwhile,
we will keep doing all the good blocking and tackling that we've been doing historically and keep focusing on
those things that we can control.
