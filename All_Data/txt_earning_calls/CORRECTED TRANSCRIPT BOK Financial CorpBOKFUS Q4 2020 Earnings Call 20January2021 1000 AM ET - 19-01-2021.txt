President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss the fourth quarter and full-year 2020 financial results. In
summary, despite a year punctuated with hurdles, it would be difficult to overstate the flexibility and persistence
our organization demonstrated this past year. A record $786.4 million in pre-tax, pre-provision revenue for 2020
proved once again the strength of our diversified revenue strategy and the stability it provides during times of
economic stress. More importantly, it underscores the breadth of our service capabilities and the value that we
provide our customers.
Starting on slide 4, full-year net income was $435 million or $6.19 per diluted share. Looking specifically at the
fourth quarter, net income was a record $154.2 million or $2.21 per diluted share, representing EPS growth of 1%
in a linked-quarter basis and that's more than 40% from the same quarter a year ago. The key items that drove
our success this quarter were starting another outstanding broad-based earnings quarter from our Wealth
Management business, continued elevated production from our Mortgage team though at a decreased level from
the last two quarters as seasonality and modest margin compression materialized following the summer's
Mortgage boom, but Mortgage margins remained strong relevant to the first-half of 2020.
No credit loss provision was needed this quarter. And, in fact, the improving economic outlook, combined with
improving credit trend, allowed us to release $6.5 million of our reserve. And lastly, the proactive measures we
took to control expense levels at the outset of the pandemic in March served us well in the fourth quarter as it did
for all of 2020.

Turning to slide 5, loan growth remained a challenge this quarter as our borrowers understandably reduced
leverage in the challenging economic environment. Stacy will cover this in more detail momentarily, but we do
believe growth opportunities will resume in 2021 as the economy continues to rebound. Deposit growth remains
excellent, up over 3% linked-quarter and up over 30% from the same quarter a year ago. Those figures did not
include the second wave of stimulus enacted late in 2020, so we anticipate this trend to continue in the near-term.
Assets under management or in custody were up over 11% for the quarter, topping $90 billion for the first time in
our company's history on very strong new client sales and favorable market impact.
We'll dive a little deeper in the record year our Wealth Management team produced in 2020, as well as a shift of
some brokerage and trading fee revenue into net interest revenue due to an increase in trading securities
balances and settlement timing in the fourth quarter. Needless to say, we are incredibly proud of our Wealth
Management division.
I'll provide additional perspective on the results before starting the Q&A session. But now Stacy Kymes will review
the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail. I'll turn the call over to Stacy.

Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Steve. Turning to slide 7, period-end loans in our core loan portfolio were $21.3 billion, down 1.8% for the
quarter. As Steve mentioned, quality borrowers reduced leverage in times of economic uncertainty, which has
been the case with our borrowers again this quarter.
Looking at the energy portfolio, balances contracting 6.7% for the quarter and 12.7% for the year. While
commodity prices have improved considerably over the last few months, sourcing new deals sufficient to offset
paydowns in the current environment remains a challenge as the existing borrowers continue to pay down debt to
reduce leverage. Despite these factors, we remain optimistic for lending and energy-related revenue growth
heading into the new year as we continue to support our customers in this space.
Remember, our diversified revenue strategy allow us to look at clients holistically, and the energy business is far
more than just lending, as witnessed by the record level of energy hedging revenue this year. Treasury,
retirement plan services, and personal wealth management are all businesses that continue to grow and serve
our energy client base.
Healthcare balances were down slightly this quarter, as growth in senior housing loans was offset by a decrease
in hospital system loans. For the year, though, healthcare loans were up 9% year-over-year, primarily due to
growth in balances from our hospital systems' clients who demonstrate a strong credit profile. Looking forward, we
remain confident in our healthcare portfolio's long-term growth and credit outlook, and expect it to be a growth
leader once again after the health and economic conditions migrate to a more normal state.
In the near term, it should be pointed out that the second stimulus bill passed last month, like the original CARES
Act, has multiple revenue enhancement measures for both hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as they manage
through the current environment.
Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, balances declined nearly 20%, as just over $470 million of balances were
forgiven in the quarter. The forgiveness process initially was more complex than we believed it would be at the
beginning of PPP in April of 2020. However, additional guidance from the Small Business Administration, or SBA,
clarifying our requirements and continued refinement of our processes has significantly reduced the time required

per application. The largest hurdle in recent months has been clients' reluctance to apply for forgiveness, as they
were hopeful of legislative action that would relax the requirements.
The recent Economic Aid Act will provide substantial forgiveness process relief, especially for those clients with
existing PPP loans of less than $150,000, which represents more than 70% of our total PPP volume. We will
participate in the newest round of PPP with largely the same strategy of focusing on our existing client base. This
will allow us to leverage additional resource capacity to meet our existing client needs in an extremely timely
manner, thereby increasing client engagement, loyalty, and retention.
Looking ahead, we are optimistic in our outlook for loan growth for 2021. The speed and shape of the broader
economic recovery will be the determining factor in restarting loan growth. However, we are well-positioned to
serve clients, and believe confidence and resulting capital investment will return in 2021.
Turning to slide 8, you'll see an updated view of the loan deferral status across the BOKF portfolio. As you can
see, just 0.6% of total loans remain in a deferral status of any type, down from 1.2% last quarter. Of the loans that
remain in deferral status, very few, 12 loans totaling $24 million, are in extended deferral. This increasingly small
portfolio of loans is closely monitored, but short term the credit quality has continued to migrate positively. Long-
term outcomes will be dependent on the pace of economic recovery and the impact of additional fiscal stimulus.
Also on slide 8, we've again compiled the list of loan segments the markets originally considered more exposed to
ongoing economic headwinds due to the pandemic. This group of loans is highly diversified, with over 550 loans
for an average loan size of less than $3 million. The $574 million retail portion of this portfolio remains the most
vulnerable today and we'll continue monitoring these exposures closely.
That said, the retail portion of our loan portfolio has held up better than expectations, as our borrowers have
proved resilient. Significant portions of this list, were originally considered more vulnerable, are performing very
well, including gaming, convenience stores, religious organizations, and colleges.
Turning to slide 9, you can see that credit quality has improved significantly since the first-half of 2020. Not only
were we able to release a portion of the loan loss reserve, but we also saw a significant credit quality
improvement in our energy portfolio as we completed our borrowing base redetermination process in the quarter.
The rebound and near-term stability in commodity prices resulted in reduced criticized and potential problem loan
numbers along with our needed reserve allocation to energy loans.
Net charge-offs were down from $22.4 million, or 37 basis points annualized, in the third quarter to $16.7 million,
or 28 basis points annualized, this quarter. 2020 net charge-offs totaled 32 basis points, well within our company's
historical loss experience. The combined allowance for loan losses totaled $389 million or 2% of outstanding
loans at quarter-end excluding PPP loans. The combined allowance for loan losses attributed to energy was
3.61% of outstanding energy loans on December 31.
Non-accruing loans increased slightly by $14 million this quarter, primarily due to an increase in non-accruing
commercial real estate loans. Potential problem loans totaled $478 million at quarter-end, down significantly from
$623 million on September 30.
Looking ahead from a credit perspective, there's still a lot of uncertainty in the current environment, so it remains
difficult to predict too far out. That said, based on what we know today and assuming our economic forecast is in-
line as we advance, we believe 2021 net charge-offs will remain on the lower end of the range of our historical
average of 30 to 50 basis points. We will continue to set our reserve at the appropriate level as we always have.

We are generally positive about the credit outlook in 2021, allowing us to begin a reserve release this quarter.
Once we have more clarity around the speed of COVID-19 case count reductions, vaccine distribution and a
broad resumption of regular economic activity in 2021, we could potentially see additional opportunity for reserve
release this year.
I'll now turn the call over to Steven to highlight our NIM dynamics, fee revenues, and the important balance sheet
items for the quarter. Steven?

Steven E. Nell
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Stacy. With a second consecutive record net income quarter, our diversified revenue strategy is clearly
providing a differentiated outcome in this low rate environment. Outsized contributions for our Wealth
Management team, coupled with diligent expense management, contributed to our success this quarter,
mitigating the impact of the current low rate environment.
Turning to slide 11, fourth quarter net interest revenue was $297 million, up more than $25 million from last
quarter. The increase relates largely to net interest revenue earned on a $5.1 billion increase in trading securities
from our brokerage and trading customer transactions. I'll describe in a moment the shift to net interest revenue
from fee revenue from our brokerage and trading business this quarter.
Net interest margin was 2.72%, down 9 basis points from the previous quarter. I provided on the slide a roll-
forward of net interest margin and the net interest revenue from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, highlighting
more significant items. PPP fees were higher in the fourth quarter as more loans were forgiven and COBZ
discount accretion was lower this quarter from an elevated level in the third quarter.
The shift in brokerage and trading customer transaction revenue from fees to net interest revenue this quarter had
a dilutive impact to net interest margin that increased the dollars recorded in net interest revenue. Other
infrequently occurring loan fees and interest recoveries are also noted in the slide to emphasize a core net
interest margin of 2.67%. Reinvestment at cash flows from our available-for-sale securities portfolio continued
with the portfolio yield declining 13 basis points to 1.98%. Additionally, we continued to have success driving
interest-bearing deposit costs down from 26 basis points last quarter to 19 basis points this quarter. While there
are many moving parts to consider including the continued recognition of PPP interest and fees, the combination
of continued repricing of the AFS portfolio and the limited room to move interest-bearing deposit costs down
further will apply pressure to net interest margin in future quarters.
Turning to slide 12, you can see the impact of the shift of brokerage and trading fee revenues to net interest
revenue that I mentioned earlier. This is largely from the record volume and timing of settlement of mortgage-
backed trading securities, which resulted in the customer transaction revenue being earned and accounted for as
interest versus fees. Additionally, energy hedging fees, while a record for the year, were down $5 million linked-
quarter from third quarter's record level. When viewed holistically, our Wealth Management team put together
another outstanding quarter with total revenue of $131.5 million, off slightly from the third quarter but still
represents the third highest quarter on record and for the full-year surpassed $500 million in total revenue for the
first time.
Transaction card revenue was down 6.7% this quarter, primarily due to the lower transaction volumes driven by
slowing consumer spending. That said, our TransFund team had a banner year for new financial institution

customer contracts in 2020 which should help mitigate the decline we saw this quarter. While conversion times
are lengthy, we expect to see a rebound in 2021 consistent with improvement in economic activity.
Fiduciary and asset management revenue increased $1.9 million this quarter, primarily driven by the increase in
fair value of assets under management related to both sales activity and favorable markets. Deposit service
charges were flat for the quarter though down $15.7 million for the year as we waived certain fees in the midst of
the pandemic.
Mortgage Banking revenue decreased $12.7 million linked-quarter due to a combination of fourth quarter
seasonality and some margin compression following elevated margins due to industry capacity constraints the
past few quarters. That said, this was still a top 10 quarter of all time for our Mortgage business, which is
significant given the typical seasonal declines in the last quarter of the year. In total, 2020 Mortgage Banking
revenue was a record for the company, increasing $74.8 million from last year and acting as a significant offset to
margin pressure of the protracted low rate environment.
Although not included on slide 12, I will note that the net economic changes and fair value of Mortgage servicing
rights and related economic hedges was positive $6.5 million for the quarter. Though fees and commissions were
down this quarter, partially due to the shift in revenue geography on the income statement, it is important to
remember the unprecedented production levels from our fee businesses the past few quarters. These businesses
operating at record levels has clearly been fundamental in the success we've had this year. We will continue to
allocate capital and rescale the employee resources to key fee areas to maximize our revenue opportunities.
Turning to slide 13, expense management remains prudent with total expenses mostly flat linked-quarter. While
total expenses were up 4% year-over-year, it should be noted that the increase in incentive compensation related
to record annual production in our Wealth Management and Mortgage businesses more than accounts for the
total increase in expenses this year. Personnel expense was down linked-quarter by just over 2%. Incentive
compensation decreased $2.1 million as a $5.3 million increase in combined cash-based and deferred
compensation was more than offset by a $7.4 million decrease in stock-based incentive compensation from last
quarter's elevated level. Additionally, there was a $1.4 million decrease in employee benefit expense due to the
typical seasonal decline in retirement costs and payroll taxes.
Non-personnel expense was up 2.5% from the third quarter. We made a $6 million charitable contribution to the
BOKF Foundation in the quarter as we continued to focus on the communities we serve and the extreme needs
created by the pandemic. Business promotion expense increased by just over $1 million, largely due to increased
advertising expense while other expense increased $3.3 million due to loss contingencies and recruiting
expenses.
Net losses and expenses on repossessed assets decreased $5.1 million, largely due to the write-downs on a set
of oil and gas properties and retail and commercial real estate properties in the third quarter. Insurance expense
also decreased $1.8 million while Mortgage Banking costs dropped $1 million.
On slide 14, our liquidity position remains very strong given the continued inflow of deposit balances. Our loan-to-
deposit ratio is now 64% compared to 68% at the end of last quarter, providing significant on balance sheet
liquidity to meet future customer needs. We expect to see a continued inflow of customer deposits in the near-
term as the end-of-year stimulus measures were not reflected in the December 31 deposit figures.
Our capital levels remain healthy as well with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12%, well ahead of our internal
operating range. With such strong capital levels, we once again were active with share repurchase,

opportunistically buying back 665,000 shares at an average price of $63.82 per share in the open market.
Additionally, we authorized an increase in our quarterly cash dividend in the fourth quarter to $0.52 cents. This is
the 15th consecutive year of dividend increases for the company as we continue to reward our shareholders
through varying types of economic environments.
On slide 15, I'll leave you with a general outlook for the near- and mid-term as we look into 2021. We believe loan
growth will slowly accelerate in tandem with the broader economic recovery this year. While mainly weighted
towards third quarter and fourth quarter, we think we can grow loans in the low single-digit range for the full-year
of 2021 excluding the impact of any PPP activity.
Our available-for-sale securities portfolio, which is largely agency mortgage-backed securities, yielded 1.98%
during the fourth quarter. Given the sustained low rate environment, prepayments could reach approximately
$800 million per quarter. We can currently reinvest those cash flows at rates around 75 to 85 basis points.
As we noted, we had success during the quarter driving deposit costs further and are well below the low point
reached during the last near-zero rate environment. We believe there could be room to push deposit costs a bit
lower, but we feel we are nearing bottom. The combination of securities, reinvestment at lower rates, and minimal
room to further lower deposit costs will pressure net interest margin in coming quarters.
Our diverse portfolio of fee revenue stream should continue to provide some mitigating impact to overall revenue
pressures being felt in our spread businesses. We expect most fee revenue categories to grow modestly in 2021,
with the exception of brokerage and trading and mortgage businesses as the 2020 record year in those areas will
be difficult to replicate.
We will continue our disciplined approach to controlling personnel and non-personnel costs with growth budgeted
at low single digits in 2021. Our focus will be holding the line on manageable expenses without sacrificing
multiyear technology commitments to improve customer service and our competitive position.
If the economy continues to improve and we get further oil price stability in 2021, additional loan loss reserve
release is possible. As I mentioned a moment ago, we feel good about our capital strength. We will continue
looking for share buyback opportunities and we'll maintain our current quarterly cash dividend level.
I'll now turn the call back over to Steve Bradshaw for closing commentary.

Steven Glen Bradshaw
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Steven. We often share that we have intentionally built BOK Financial to mitigate downside risk and
earnings volatility in times of economic uncertainty. Disciplined credit underwriting throughout the cycle and
investing in growth for our fee-based businesses has been a lasting point of pride for our company for many
years. 2020 was the ultimate test of that strategy. The pressures of such a challenging year should be detrimental
to the area's potential of most regional financial institutions, but I'm very proud to say that we delivered a
differentiated outcome for our customers, our communities, our employees, and our shareholders.
Looking ahead to 2021, we expect that strategy to continue to deliver solid results. We see an opportunity to
further our market share with select fee business segments, along with a return of lending opportunities as our
clients' confidence rebounds with the economy, motivating them to resume capital investment.

through the challenges brought by the pandemic.

I just wanted to make sure I fully understood what was happening with the additional trading securities in the NII
line. I mean, is this something that you guys initiated and is this something that is going – like should we – is this
sort of the right level for both brokerage and for NII? Like I'm just trying to think about how this all comes together.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ken, this is Steven. I think it was market dynamics. There was a record trading in Ginnie Mae securities
from all of the summertime activity. And we facilitated those trades with our clients and those securities settled on
our balance sheet, more so than some of the previous securities that we traded with our clients. And so we
earned that transaction revenue through net interest income versus the fee revenue.
So, it was a market dynamic shift for the most part with our trading securities up over $5 billion on average in
earning assets for the quarter. So I don't know; Scott may know what in the future may occur. But I would suspect
that a lot of those trading securities will be maintained in that kind of fashion at least going into the first part of this
year.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Got you. Okay. So I guess, by definition, should we – so if that keeps your NII elevated, does that mean that we
should also assume brokerage and trading revenues to stay at this much more depressed level in the first
quarter?
And then, it sounds like you said since it's only going in the first quarter, then maybe things go back to normal in
second and third. I mean, is that just the right way of thinking about the dynamics?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I really think the fee revenues will stay down at this level. I really think the trading activity with our clients will
show up more in – at least like this quarter in NII. But what we do in the brokerage and trading is look at the entire
revenue stream together. We don't really care if the transactions are recorded as net interest income or fees. And
in this particular quarter, it's shifted more to the NII side. And that may be what occurs, I would suspect, at least
the first part of the year maybe on into 2021. We just follow kind of how it settles with our clients, in how we record
it, in which bucket.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. I think that makes sense. And then just one last question for me. Excluding all the trading securities,
right, obviously, your guidance for net interest margin is lower. It sounds like you expect very modest loan growth
maybe picking up in the back-half of the year. On average, it sounds like NII ex the trading should sort of be under
a fairly sizable amount of pressure. I was wondering if you can kind of quantify the impact on an NII based on
those factors. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I'll try to give you a little bit more of a core kind of NIM number to start off with in the year. We've put that on
the chart at about 2.67%. Again, it's hard to say how much that will migrate down. I do think it will because of the
repricing of our available-for-sale securities portfolio. I mean if you look at the charts that we provide, you can see
a pretty natural decline in AFS securities yields. I think it was 18 basis points a couple of quarters ago, 13 basis
points this quarter. It's going to continue to roll down.
Now, we've been very successful in pushing down our interest-bearing deposit cost and again this quarter. In fact,
it was 19 basis points average for this quarter, and I think the month of December it was down about 17 basis
points. Can we continue pushing that downward? Perhaps we can. But I don't think there's significant room to
offset some of the AFS securities repricing.
So I just think there's a natural kind of migration downward of net interest margin. Of course, we focus more on
net interest revenue than anything else. And to your point, loans beginning to grow we hope sometime in 2021,
particularly in the second-half of the year is going to certainly help stabilize the margin and bring it back forward.

Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I just had a follow-up on the inventory of trading securities. So – I mean, we're up at $7 billion now that – looking
back over the last of couple years, that's ranged in between $1.5 billion to $2 billion and we're now at $7 billion.
So it sounds like it's going to stay around $7 billion here in the near-term. But longer-term, does that normalize
back to that $2 billion-ish level or is this just here to stay?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Hi. This is Scott. So I would – when you look at the trend throughout 2020 that built from $4.6 billion end of Q1 to
$6.2 billion at the end of Q3 and then the $7 billion, a little bit over $7 billion in the fourth quarter. So we look for
that to remain at a higher level. That will obviously depend upon the total volume and flow inside of the Mortgage
markets themselves but we don't look at that reverting back, as you indicated to those low levels that you were
referencing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Right. That's helpful. And then if you look at loan balances ex-PPP, it seems like for the last three quarters
or so those kind of core loan balances have been down in between kind of 5% to 8% annualized. I think this
quarter it was down 8% linked-quarter annualized. So what gives you the confidence that you can see a reversal
away from the shrinkage and towards seeing some modest loan growth here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I think the biggest piece of that is you – look, annualized energy loans which are one of our largest
segments of lending is down almost 13% year-over-year; and linked-quarter annualized, it was down 6.7% so –
not annualized, just linked-quarter.
So if you get stability with those energy balances which we think we're close to, you're going to get some
paydowns. I think we may see a little bit more run-off in the first quarter then hopefully we begin to plateau and
grow from there. We are seeing new deals there, but it's just not outpacing the level of deleveraging or paydowns
that are happening within that book but a lot of good activity that we've gotten out of the work that we did around
the PPP program. We think we're well-positioned there. But I think you see – you need economic growth and I
think you also need some of this liquidity to work its way off the balance sheet before you really get to core loan
growth. But I think the numbers that we gave you in terms of low single-digit loan growth for the year back
weighted to the second-half of the year I think we feel very confident about, assuming we get stability and then
growth in the energy book.

Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then finally for me and a lot of people are expecting 2021 to be a fairly active
year related to bank M&A. I know BOKF has been selectively active in acquiring banks and fee income
businesses over the years. How do you think – do you think BOKF will be active in M&A this year?

Steven Glen Bradshaw A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, this is Steve. I think your assumption is accurate that we're going to see more M&A opportunities. If you go
back in time when you see low rate environment and revenue headwinds, that obviously leads to a desire among
some sellers to be open to conversation. So that's an opportunity that we see coming as well, and we'll continue
to look at selective opportunities that maybe present themselves throughout 2021, primarily prioritizing those
things that would be within the footprint.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
So obviously you guys are doing really well on the credit front and with the outlook, the economy improving. Do
you see that the reserve-to-loan ratio could get back to the January 1 level which was about 1.2%? Do you see it
heading that way towards the end of this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Peter, this is Marc Maun. If I'm looking at that, what I'm seeing is if you see continued improvement and you see
the economic outlook improve, you see pandemic cases drop dramatically and the vaccine results be achieved
along with the energy prices continuing to be stable like we've seen in the recent months, and essentially you
recover back to a January 2020 outlook. That was our day one adjustment amount at 1.2%. And that would seem
likely, if all those things occur. Of course, there's still a lot of ifs in that forecast.

Okay. And then, Steven, if you get that loan growth in the second-half of the year, would that help do you think
lead to more of a stable margin closer in the second-half of this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean it would. Certainly when you remix your earning assets away from securities more into the loan
balances, certainly it's going to help support NIM going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. If I could just sneak in one more question, Mortgage Banking had a record year this year. It's expected to
decline a little but Mortgage will still be strong. As we look out into the outer years, have you seen that this
business has – you've taken market share, and so therefore you should still see growth above like a 2019 level
even with the Mortgage Banking business slowing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Glen Bradshaw A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, Peter. This is Steve. I think our outlook in 2021 is Mortgage kind of in a steady-state; fourth quarter
probably a pretty good proxy. Although we'll see some – probably an increase in refi activity in quarter one as we
typically do, and purchase market kind of kicks in a little stronger after that.
I do think that there's been market share gain for us because we've invested more outside of Oklahoma. We've
got a much stronger group of producers in Colorado, in Texas, in Arizona, New Mexico, et cetera, that – and
Kansas City that have really paid off for us. So that's where our expansion has been. And I think it's kind of a
mirror, in my mind, to the company in that we have relatively small market share with good upside in all of those
markets. And I think Mortgage better reflects that today than it probably did three to five years ago.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And I guess sticking with the provision reserve level, what type of qualitative overlays did you use this quarter on
the energy book or in the overall book and did that really help, I guess, slow reserve releases? And as we go
through the year, we should just expect that qualitative overlays reduces to get back to that lower allowance
level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Again, this is Marc Maun. Yes, we took a hard look at the qualitative overlays with regard to our reserves.
We certainly did look at more reallocation than we did reduction in certain areas. Energy obviously improved and
we did reduce that reserve down to 3.4% from the 4.2% it was last quarter. But we still have concerns in certain
other areas, where stimulus has been a key factor in a number of areas, particularly in CRE and in smaller
businesses that may or may not have masked some issues that could occur. And so, we want to make sure we're
thoughtful about how we're looking at the performance of the credit in the short term, and then evaluate them on a
quarter-by-quarter basis, depending on how economic activity evolves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
But your general thesis is on point. And I think our view is that given where we are in the cycle, it was premature
to do much more than what we did. But certainly, as we get more visibility into the economic recovery, the pace of
vaccinations, and see declines in case counts and improvement in economic activity, that could change.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's good color. Thanks. And then looking at the energy book, do you really – do you think that energy
prices need to go higher from here to drive additional growth or is it really just absorbing that existing liquidity
that's out there; and once that's absorbed, that can start driving organic growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
We're – I mean, we're in a decent spot here. I mean if you think about oil particularly, that kind of between $50,
$55 is not a bad spot to be in in terms of kind of being stable. And certainly in the Permian, that's an area that
people continue to grow and do that profitably. But from our perspective, this is a price area where once we can
find kind of a stable spot, then I think we can grow from here. There are new deals being done. We're doing those
deals. We're leading many of those deals, so we see good opportunity there. It's just, at some point, the pace of
deleveraging from energy borrowers will slow, and we'll really see all the hard work that our energy team is doing
to grow that really come to the surface. And I think we're going to see that. I don't know if that's first quarter or
second quarter, but I think that we are going to see that in 2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just finally for me, the second round of PPP has started. How should we think about the potential
size of that for you, as well as the potential maybe average loan size compared to what we saw in the first round?

Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, just by nature of it, it's going to be lower. I mean, I think the maximum loan size, generally speaking, is about
$2 million or caveats around revenue declines and things like that. So it won't be to the size that the original PPP
program was. We certainly are going to be active participating, working very hard to help our customers who can
avail themselves of that to participate in that. But we don't foresee that it will be the size of the original program as
much because of the constraints around loan size as other factors.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I mean, should we be thinking if you were just over $2 billion the first time, around $1 billion or too early to say?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
It's too early to say. I mean, we're – and even just yesterday, there's new rules coming out that are governing the
program from the SBA. So, I think it's awfully hard to prognosticate with any level of clarity at this point.

Jon Arfstrom Q

A question for you, Stacy, on slide 7. You touched on loan growth maybe picking up later in the year and it
sounds like a big factor in that is energy. But can you touch a little bit more on if we roll this thing forward 12
months, what do you think the biggest contributors to growth might be in terms of the other loan categories?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
I think all of the loan categories – I mean, I think if you get – if you roll this thing forward 12 months, you get stable
commodity prices, you're going to be growing energy mid-single digits or maybe a little bit better. Our healthcare
book is really doing well; really proud of that team. You saw us back up just a hair there this quarter, but that was
really from some large paydowns in health systems loans, which given their liquidity situation that was there,
really masked some really good growth that we have there in senior housing.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
And our C&I businesses, I think, are poised to do very well. I think one of the real benefits that we got from the
original PPP is how strongly we executed. And so, we've really been able to turn that into new treasury
relationships. And we believe that once the market kind of looks normal again, that that's going to really create
some opportunities for us on the C&I side because of the levels at which we executed, and the ability to call a
banker and have a relationship in times of need and have somebody you can call and help you out.
And so, we're optimistic that once we get to normal, that growing at a pace that's kind of 2 to 3 times GDP, if you
will, which is kind of how we kind of benchmark it over a long time horizon is very reasonable for us with the mix
of business that we have. We also have a great footprint. I mean, we're not – we're in some footprint states that
are going to grow faster than the rest of the United States. So if you think about Texas and Arizona and Colorado,
we're well-positioned from a geographic perspective to disproportionately benefit from growth as those core
states' economies are likely to grow faster than the national economy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
I'll add one thing to that. It's just from the C&I perspective is that you did see reduced utilization as a big part of
the decline in economic activity. And we would expect if that improves, then we'll see increased utilization on the
lines of credit, et cetera, which will contribute to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good. You knocked up a couple of my questions there. But I guess, the – which is good. But just in general, aside
from energy, are you seeing signs of life in the footprint? I would guess it is happening particularly in some of
those better markets, but are you seeing the early signs of optimism in pipelines building?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
I think it's – I mean, I think until we begin to work some of this liquidity off, I don't think you're going to see huge
C&I loan growth. We're seeing some in healthcare around senior housing, but really until you begin to work off
some of the core liquidity that's really built up among our borrowers, you're going to struggle to see that in the
near-term. So I think it's premature from our perspective. We have not yet seen kind of a bubbling up of economic
activity that would lead us to believe in the near-term. There are core C&I loan growth imminent from our
perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then just one quick on credit, the energy NPLs that you show on slide 9, what is the path to resolution
with some of those credits and particularly against the lower end of the charge-off range that you're expecting for
the full-year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
You know what, we'll work through those as each one will work themself out. I think that what I would tell you is a
couple of things: Number one, I think we're very comfortable with the net charge-off guidance we provided which
kind of is the low end of that historical range. I think if you look at what we charged-off in 2020 I mean that would
be a decent benchmark to try to beat in 2021.
16

I think the difference too is we've got a rising commodity price on those energy loans. And so trying to resolve and
workout energy loan in a stable and rising price environment is a totally different story than when prices continue
to fall. And so I think we're relatively optimistic that as we work through those that the guidance that we provided
you will be one that we can certainly achieve. And certainly our hope is to outperform that because I think the
environment is providing us a bit of an opportunity to work some of those out in a way that's to our benefit.
There will be losses that come from those nonperforming loans but the question is will the environment be stable
and even slightly rising price environment really help mitigate those? And I think we're optimistic about that.

question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about operating expenses and the
guidance that you guys put out there. It sounds really good trying to keep that to the low single-digit growth in
2021. Any more details on how you expect to achieve that and I want to make sure we're apples-to-apples and
the right starting point. I'm looking at $1.166 billion of operating expenses in 2020, is that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So this is Steven. We just worked hard I think in our budgeting efforts over the fall and mainly in November,
working with each line of business and trying to determine what is the right level of expense and how can we
maintain control over that in the face of a little bit more difficult revenue environment. And it comes all across the
board. It addresses personnel, it addresses business promotion, spending on IT, we want to maintain because we
want to maintain our competitiveness with our products and services that we provide to our clients. But it's just a
lot of detailed work to try to maintain that expense discipline.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then on the buyback, I'm curious what the appetite is for the buyback now that the stock price is well
above levels where you executed in the third quarter – or fourth quarter, excuse me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean we were happy of our execution in the fourth quarter. I mean we bought the shares at about a 25%
discount to today's market. We'll look at it closely. I'm not going to put a price out there that says we'll buy at this
level and we won't buy it below that or above that. So I think we look at it relative to our capital levels, relative to
opportunities for capital but I still think we have an appetite and we have the capital wherewithal to take
advantage across the market when we see there's good opportunity.

Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then on the PPP, you may have disclosed this; I just missed it what was the amount that you
recognized of the PPP fees in the fourth quarter and what's the remaining level of fees to recognize from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So we recognized in the fourth quarter $3.3 million in net interest revenue from PPP and $13.5 million in
fees, so a total of $16.8 million on the fee side. And we have about $25 million roughly remaining on the fee side.

question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning. The questions largely were answered. But just as it relates again to the loan growth side of things,
I understand obviously a stabilization in energy book would certainly be a positive for loan growth next year or this
year. In terms of general business and I think this was asked or answered to some degree, but are you seeing
any increase in pipelines there? Are there any pockets geographically where you're seeing activity perk up more
than others?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Not particularly. Not at this point. I think that the point that Marc made earlier which I think is the best one on the
C&I portfolios, keep in mind most of our C&I portfolio is borrowing-based driven. So it's accounts receivable,
inventory, and those types of things. So our utilization is really pretty low in that particularly on a relative basis to
where we were pre-pandemic. So there's an opportunity for growth there organically just from higher utilization as
those receivable and inventory balances begin to come back up as people grow again, then that's an opportunity
for growth organically.
But I also think, as I've mentioned earlier, that the work that we've done with our borrowers and with others you
may have multiple banking relationships around the PPP has opened a really opportunistic pipeline for us to grow
18


BOK Financial Corp.
(BOKF) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
broadly as well. And so I think that we're well-positioned once the economy begins to turn around to grow that
core C&I portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And just briefly on the energy book, you talked about there are new deals out there that you're participating
in or leading, could you give us a sense for the quarter of originations in that segment versus paydowns?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
I don't have that today. Certainly, the paydowns far exceeded the new originations. But we've done more than a
handful of deals in the fourth quarter that were new deals in the marketplace and many of those we led and
received fee revenue associated with that. So we're optimistic. I think really the question is when do we get to the
bottom of the deleveraging? And I think we're close. I just don't know if that's first quarter or second quarter but I
think we can see it from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
