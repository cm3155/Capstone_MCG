MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Fifth Third Bancorp Third
Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to
your speakers today. Chris Doll, you may begin.

Chris Doll
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thank you, Marcella. Good morning, thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our results for the third
quarter of 2020. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings
release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, along with information
pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's
performance.
We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date
of this call. I'm joined this morning by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Risk
Officer, Jamie Leonard; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun,
we will open the call up for questions.
Let me turn the call over to Greg now for his comments.

Gregory D. Carmichael
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. I hope you are all doing well and staying healthy.
Once again, our financial results were strong despite the challenges associated with the current environment. As
an essential business, we continue to take appropriate actions for our customers, our employees and our
communities during the pandemic. Earlier today, we reported third quarter net income available to common
shareholders of $562 million or $0.78 per share.
Our reported EPS included a negative $0.07 impact from the items shown on Page 2 of our release. Excluding
these items, adjusted third quarter earnings were $0.85 per share. Tayfun will provide more details on the
quarterly financial results in his remarks. But I will share some highlights. All reported and adjusted return metrics
were solid, reflecting our strong operating results, including the provision for credit loss performance.
Our credit losses were significantly better than expectations. At 35 basis points, our third quarter charge-offs were
the lowest level in over a year, with improvement in both consumer and commercial portfolios. Consumer net
charge-offs of 40 basis points is the lowest in the past 15-plus years, reflecting our consistently strong approach
to underwriting, as well as the benefits of fiscal stimulus and payment deferrals.
Our already strong capital position further improved this quarter. Our CET1 ratio of 10.1% is well above our stated
target of around 9.5% and our income levels, combined with the outcomes from our quarterly stress test, continue
to suggest that we will maintain our current dividend. Furthermore, we have grown tangible book value per share
for six consecutive quarters.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Our PPNR results were better than our previous expectations, reflecting the strength and resilience of our diverse
revenue mix in retail, commercial and wealth and asset management. Based on our fee-based businesses, many
of our fee-based businesses are generating strong results that are helping to cushion the impact of lower rates.
For instance, wealth and asset management revenue increased 10% sequentially as we generated positive AUM
inflows again this quarter as we have done in 9 out of the last 10 quarters.
Capital markets revenue was up 8% from last year and was down slightly relative to the record second quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, total commercial banking fee revenue was up 16% compared to last year. Top line
mortgage revenue is up 45% from the year-ago quarter, with the low rate environment impacting servicing
revenue and the MSR valuation. Deposit fees increased 18% and processing revenue increased 12%
sequentially, both better than our previous guidance as we are seeing early signs of normalization in business
and consumer spending patterns. While we continue to streamline our operations and position the bank for long-
term success, we continue to assess strategic investments and non-bank acquisitions in our fee-based
businesses to accelerate revenue growth.
For instance, we recently increased our strategic investment in Bellwether Enterprise, a national multiproduct
CRE firm, which we originally announced in April. This investment provides clients with a broader set of
permanent financing solutions without Fifth Third being exposed to the balance sheet risk associated with longer
duration CRE assets.
Commercial loan production was relatively stable this quarter compared to the second quarter, offset by further
declines in line utilization. Total average loans declined 4% sequentially, within our previous guidance range. We
expect near-term pressure in the loan portfolio to continue.
Despite the tepid loan environment, net interest income exceeded our previous guidance as we aggressively
reduced our deposit costs in excess of our prior expectations. While the environment remains uncertain, our
commercial loan pipelines are beginning to improve in certain areas, particularly in technology, telecom,
healthcare and industrials, which should provide support as we head into next year.
Before I turn it over to Tayfun to further discuss our results and outlook, I'll review our guiding principles, strategic
actions and key strategic priorities, which will enable us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value. We
have consistently communicated our through-the-cycle principles of disciplined client selection, conservative
underwriting and an overall balance sheet management approach focused on long-term performance.
Our unwavering adherence to these principles and our balance sheet strength gives us confidence as we
navigate this environment. We have executed numerous strategic actions over the past five years in anticipation
of a downturn, which will continue to serve us well. We've reduced our credit risk exposures and built strong
reserve coverage. We've built long-term protection to mitigate the impact of lower interest rates.
We took decisive actions to reduce our expense base and we successfully invested in and diversified our fee
businesses. From a commercial client standpoint, we continue to focus on generating relationships with clients
who have more diversified and resilient businesses. We are confident in our client selection process and proactive
approach to credit risk management.
We continue to believe we are well positioned relative to peers in commercial real estate, an area where we have
remained disciplined. We have focused predominantly on top-tier developers with a track record of resiliency. Our
portfolio is well diversified by geography and property type. And as we have discussed before, we continue to be
at the low end of peers as a percentage of total capital.

In addition to the CRE portfolio, our other lending portfolios continue to do well â€“ be well positioned, combining
our strong retail and regional commercial banking franchises in the Midwest and Southeast with our national
lending businesses. These portfolios will be instrumental in delivering a differentiated credit performance, given
the likelihood of an uneven economic recovery.
We're monitoring our exposures across our total commercial loan portfolio, utilizing early warning systems through
a combination of internal portfolio analysis and third-party data. Our relationship teams receive timely alerts if we
detect any sign of credit deterioration. This helps us make prompt, prudent and accurate credit rating
determinations proactively without waiting for customer statements.
Looking ahead to 2021, we continue to expect full-year net charge-offs to come in well below 1%. We have also
strengthened our balance sheet by building long-term protection, through the positioning of our securities and
hedge portfolios. With the high likelihood of lower rates for the next several years, our prudent interest rate risk
management should help preserve our core margin.
Our very strong balance sheet liquidity has enabled us to decisively act and aggressively lower deposit rates.
Given the industry-wide revenue headwinds, including the strong likelihood of persistently low interest rates, we
recently announced an expense optimization plan. We are taking decisive and appropriate actions to reduce our
expense base, both temporarily reflecting the weaker revenue environment and also permanently based on long-
term structural saving opportunities.
Our four key strategic priorities remain intact, leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation,
driving organic growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies, and maintaining a disciplined
approach on expenses and client selection.
We will put the appropriate level of prioritization and focus on the areas that have the highest probability of driving
strong financial returns and generate long-term value for our shareholders in order for us to emerge from the
current environment a top performing regional bank. Our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues and
continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve us well as we navigate this challenging
environment.
I would like to once again thank our employees. I'm very proud of the way you have responded in extraordinary
ways to support our customers, our communities and each other during these unprecedented times.
Our commitment to generating sustainable value for our stakeholders is evident in our inaugural Environmental,
Social and Governance Report as we also became the first US commercial bank to join the SASB Alliance and
the GRI Community. Our report and other helpful disclosures are available for your review on a dedicated ESG
page on our Investor Relations' website.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook.

Thank you, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let's move to the financial highlights on slide
three of the earnings presentation. Reported results for this quarter were negatively impacted by three notable
items, a $30 million after-tax charge related to our previously announced restructuring plan, a $17 million after-tax
negative mark related to the Visa total return swap and $4 million after-tax from COVID-related expenses.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Strong operating results for the quarter reflected solid business performance throughout the bank, as well as the
impact of provision, which resulted from our best quarterly charge-off performance since mid-2019 stabilization in
key forward-looking macroeconomic indicators compared to the past couple of quarters as well as lower period-
end balances.
Although we are seeing relative stability in the key macroeconomic variables used in our reserve calculations, we
continue to take a cautious approach, given remaining uncertainties related to the pandemic and the economy.
Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes GDP remains below the end of 2019 levels until the second
quarter of 2022, with an unemployment rate worse than the current environment, remaining elevated above 8%
through 2021. Our base case is generally more conservative than the Fed base scenario published last month.
Our downside scenario assumes that GDP will remain below the end of 2019 levels until the second quarter of
2023, with unemployment further deteriorating from the third quarter, exceeding 12% through the first half of 2021
until improving to 11% by the end of 2021 and reaching 8.4% by the end of 2022. If we were to assign a 100%
probability to the downside scenario, we would likely require an additional $1.3 billion in reserves based on our
current balance sheet exposures.
Reported and adjusted revenues grew 2% sequentially despite the generally weak environment as we
outperformed our previous fee and NII expectations. Total non-interest income, excluding the impact of securities
gains, was up 5% sequentially, 3 percentage points better than our previous guidance.
With respect to the outsized securities gains this quarter, it is important to note that our unrealized gains in the
portfolio at the end of the quarter remain very high at $2.7 billion. Our very deliberate actions over the past few
years that focused on structuring the portfolio in anticipation for a lower rate environment should continue to give
us a strong advantage as a very effective hedging tool to help mitigate the rate headwinds. Having said that, we
will continue to be prudent in managing the gains for the best outcome for our shareholders, cognizant that these
gains will continue to be subject to future volatility, especially to fluctuations in the current pre-payment
environment.
This quarter, a small portion of our portfolio gains cushioned the impact of the restructuring charges that we
incurred related to our expense reduction plan, which we believe was a prudent risk-based action in light of the
current environment. Reported and adjusted non-interest expenses were flat year-over-year. On a sequential
basis, adjusted expenses increased slightly more than our previous guidance of up 2%.
We are in the midst of executing our expense reduction actions announced last month, which will generate annual
efficiencies of $200 million starting in 2021 with an additional $100 million to $150 million of annual efficiencies to
be generated starting in 2022. As a result of our strong revenue performance and continued expense discipline,
PPNR increased sequentially and outperformed our July guidance by approximately $15 million.
Given the strong PPNR performance, combined with the credit related improvements, we generated strong
reported and adjusted return metrics. We achieved an adjusted ROA of 1.24% and an adjusted return on tangible
common equity of 18.2%, excluding AOCI, despite growing our regulatory capital 42 basis points during the
quarter. Excluding the securities gains, our adjusted ROTCE was nearly 17%. Even on a credit-normalized basis,
our underlying ROTCE performance is indicative of the strength of the franchise and our ability to successfully
navigate a low rate environment.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Moving to slide 4, total average loans declined 4% sequentially, within our previous guidance range. C&I loan
balance trends continued to reflect lower revolver utilization rates, which declined by 15% from the mid-April peak
to 33% at quarter end and declined by 5% since the end of June. The decrease in average C&I loans was
partially offset by an increase in average auto loan balances.
Due to the uneven nature of revolver utilization rates and the impact of PPP loans, we are providing period-end
loan balance performance. Revolving line of credit balances decreased in excess of $3 billion, which constituted
approximately three-fourths of the end-of-period balance quarter-over-quarter decline.
Line utilization trends so far in the first two weeks of the fourth quarter indicate continued low utilization levels,
which we expect will likely persist at least through the end of this year. C&I client pipelines remained generally
soft, but have somewhat improved relative to last quarter. Average and period-end CRE loans decreased 1%
sequentially.
As we discussed before, we believe that the commercial real estate sector is particularly vulnerable to the current
economic environment and potential changes in the post-pandemic economy, which continues to favor our low
exposure and focus on high-quality borrowers in this sector.
Average total consumer loans increased 1% sequentially. Continued growth in the auto portfolio was offset by
declines in home equity and credit card. Auto production in the quarter was strong at $1.8 billion with average
FICO scores around 780 and lower advance rates, higher internal scores, better spreads and a higher
concentration of new versus used autos compared to recent quarters. Most of the other consumer loan categories
continued to reflect the generally subdued borrower demand.
Our securities portfolio of around $35 billion decreased 2% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of
the sales, as well as continued pay downs. Unless the market environment changes, we are unlikely to use any of
the excess liquidity to grow our investment portfolio in the near term. The underlying risk/return profile of many of
the investment options is not attractive in light of the impact of the aggressive monetary actions that the Fed is
executing.
Average other short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, increased $10 billion compared to
the prior quarter and increased $27 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. The significant increase in excess
cash is the outcome of the ongoing decline in loan balances, combined with record deposit growth over the past
six months.
Moving on to slide 5. Compared to the prior quarter, average core deposits increased 4%, with growth in all
deposit captions, except other time deposits. Average demand deposits represented 33% of total core deposits in
the current quarter compared to 31% in the prior quarter. Average commercial transaction deposits increased 6%
and average consumer transaction deposits increased 3%. The deposit growth came from improvement in every
line of business and was very granular across product types and customer size.
Overall, the deposit performance reflects our strong longstanding client relationships and our customers' desire to
remain liquid. In addition to growth in deposit dollars, we once again generate consumer household growth during
the quarter, reflecting strong production, as well as limited attrition.
As shown on slide 6, we have continued to take proactive steps, which are predominantly focused on the right
side of the balance sheet to mitigate the impact of lower rates, which should provide additional support in the
7

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
coming quarters. Compared to the second quarter, we lowered our interest-bearing core deposit rates 14 basis
points, more than our expectations, while continuing to generate strong deposit growth.
As a result, our September interest-bearing core deposit rate is now just 11 points with total core deposit costs of
just 7 basis points, both well below the floors from the previous rate cycle. We expect fourth quarter interest-
bearing core deposit costs to benefit from our actions and decline another few basis points.
Our loan-to-core deposit ratio improved to 72% as our short-term investments, predominantly interest-bearing
cash were approximately $31 billion at quarter end. Excluding PPP loans, our loan-to-core deposit ratio was 69%.
Currently, there are no strong indications that the liquidity profile of our balance sheet is likely to change soon. As
loan growth continues to be elusive and investment opportunities relatively unattractive, we will remain â€“ we will
maintain our short-term cash balances at these levels until further notice.
Turning to slide 7, reported and adjusted NII decreased 2% compared to the prior quarter. The decline was
primarily attributable to lower C&I balances and the impact of lower market rates. These impacts were partially
offset by the reduction in deposit costs, the full quarter impact of PPP loans, day count and the favorable impact
of previously executed cash flow hedges.
As you can see on this slide, the hedges added an incremental $10 million to our third quarter NII for a total
contribution of $72 million during the quarter. Purchase accounting adjustments benefited our third quarter net
interest margin by three basis points this quarter. Our adjusted NIM decreased 16 basis points sequentially,
driven by the unfavorable impacts from elevated cash balances, which created an approximate 15 basis point
drag on NIM compared to the prior quarter, lower market rates and lower C&I balances, partially offset by benefits
from our actions to lower deposit costs and the previously executed cash flow hedges. As we have been
highlighting all along, our interest rate risk hedging strategy has two pillars: the structure and composition of our
investment portfolio and the size and duration of our derivative portfolio.
As I stated earlier, our swaps and floors contributed $72 million this quarter. Our portfolio premium amortization
was only $1 million and our portfolio yield declined only 7 basis points. You can easily see that our investment
portfolio does not erode the protection provided by the derivative portfolio like it has for many of our peers. As
importantly, we have protection in both portfolios longer than our peers.
Excluding the impact of excess cash relative to historical averages and the lower yielding PPP loans, normalized
NIM was approximately 3.03% for the third quarter. We expect that we will continue to be able to generate a
normalized NIM of around 3% for the foreseeable future, helped by our interest rate hedges and investment
portfolio composition. The fourth quarter NII and NIM are both expected to remain stable. Our guidance has no
accelerated benefits from PPP loan forgiveness.
Moving on to slide eight, we once again had a strong quarter generating fee revenues that offset the pressure on
interest income. The resilience in our total fees continues to highlight the level of revenue diversification that we
have achieved.
Adjusted non-interest income, excluding the benefit of securities gains, increased 5% sequentially, exceeding our
previous guidance by approximately $20 million. The strong performance reflected another solid quarter in capital
markets, strong performance in wealth and asset management and rebounds in deposit service charges, card
and processing revenue and in the leasing business.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
In our commercial business, the strong capital markets revenue was down from the record set last quarter, but
was up approximately 8% from the year-ago quarter. Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $23 million
sequentially, primarily driven by an unfavorable MSR net valuation adjustment and an increase in MSR decay
resulting from higher prepayment speeds. Current quarter mortgage originations of $4.5 billion increased 32%
compared to the prior quarter.
Asset management fees increased 10% sequentially, benefiting from stronger market conditions, improved
brokerage fees and the continuation of positive AUM flows. The strong wealth and asset management
performance over the past several quarters reflects our prioritized investments in this business both in talent
upgrades as well as acquisitions to improve the ROE profile of our company.
Card and processing revenue increased $10 million or 12%, reflecting increases in credit and debit transaction
volumes, resulting from the continued normalization in consumer spending patterns. Deposit service charges
increased $22 million or 18%, with improving commercial deposit fees, reflecting a partial loan normalization of
treasury management service volumes and lower earning credits as well as elevated consumer deposit fees
compared to the prior quarter, which included hardship-related fee waivers. We expect processing revenues and
deposit fees to be stable to slightly higher in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to slide 9, third quarter reported pre-tax expenses included restructuring charges of $28 million,
intangible amortization expense of $12 million and COVID-related expenses of $5 million. Adjusting for these
items and prior-period items shown in our materials, non-interest expense increased 3% sequentially and
decreased $1 million compared to the year-ago quarter. As we discussed first in September during the Barclays
Conference, in light of revenue headwinds, we are taking action to reduce our annual 2021 run rate expenses by
approximately $200 million.
We have started taking appropriate actions in September and expect to finalize all actions by the end of this
quarter. We will share with you the full set of details in January during our fourth quarter earnings call when we
will also give you an outlook for the direction of our expenses in 2021. With respect to personnel decisions, we
expect to generate the full run-rate savings beginning in the first quarter of 2021.
In addition to the staffing optimization, we remain on track to deliver the remaining savings through a combination
of process re-engineering, rationalization of certain smaller non-core businesses, vendor renegotiations and
corporate real estate rationalization, which are all progressing as well as the savings associated with the
reduction in our branch network.
While we will continue to open branches in our existing high-growth Southeast markets to generate household
and revenue growth, we expect to further optimize our network by closing an additional 37 branches in the first
quarter of 2021, predominantly in the Midwest.
As we have discussed before, the recent acceleration in customer digital adoption trends raises the returns on our
technology investments made over the past several years. This gives us increased conviction that we can
continue to optimize our branch network, while also expanding our presence in high-growth markets.
Also, our investments and focus on process re-engineering in other areas of our operations will allow us to
permanently optimize our expenses in our middle office and back office functions. We believe that approximately
20% of the 2021 savings are environment dependent. When the market rebounds and sustains economic
recovery, we will re-adjust these resources accordingly.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
In addition to a near-term savings target, we also announced a longer-term expense strategy which will help us
achieve an additional $100 million to $150 million in run rate savings, starting in 2022 through investments in lean
process automation.
Slide 10 provides an update on our COVID-19 high-impact portfolios. The amounts on this page represent
approximately 10% of our total loans and are down 8% from last quarter, excluding PPP loans. As you can see,
the paydowns during the quarter reduced our balances relative to the second quarter in all sub-categories, except
for leisure travel where we have a rather small overall exposure, all to larger operators.
The total balances on this slide include approximately $1 billion from our leveraged loan portfolio, which remains
below $4 billion and has decreased 7% sequentially. The information on this slide lays out the reasons why we
believe that our client selection in these portfolios has been very disciplined with a focus on larger companies that
have access to capital in stressed environments and where we have the appropriate credit mitigants in place to
limit the ultimate loss content in these portfolios.
On slide 11, we provide an updated view of the consumer and mortgage portfolios. The FICO scores clearly
indicate the high credit quality of the portfolio, with over 57% containing FICO scores of 750 or higher on a
balance-rated basis. Approximately 90% of the consumer portfolio is secured. And as you can see by our FICO
band distributions, our portfolio is heavily weighted in the high prime/super prime space.
As we have previously discussed, we have taken proactive steps to enhance our underwriting standards,
specifically on minimum FICO scores and maximum LTV levels in addition to increasing our efforts in collections.
Turning to credit results on slide 12. The net charge-off ratio of 35 basis points improved 9 basis points
sequentially. The sequential improvement reflects favorable outcomes in both portfolios with the commercial
credit favorability coming from better resolutions as well as extensions, and consumer credit continuing to exhibit
results that are more commensurate with a stronger employment environment.
Borrowers have been clearly helped by the stimulus and COVID-related relief programs. And those who request
an additional 180 days of mortgage payment assistance, as provided under the CARES Act, will benefit into next
year. NPAs remain generally well behaved at 84 basis points. The sequential increase was entirely in commercial,
with growth coming predominantly from our COVID high-impact portfolios and some credits in the energy
portfolio, which we believe will ultimately result in low loss content.
Our ACL ratio declined only by 1 basis point sequentially to 2.49%, reflecting the stability in both the current
macroeconomic environment, as well as the drivers of the forward-looking scenarios. The low level of net charge-
offs, combined with the $116 million decline in the allowance, reflecting lower period-end loans, resulted in a net
$15 million benefit to the provision.
Slide 13 provides more information on the allocation of our allowance and the composition of the changes this
quarter. In commercial, higher reserve coverage was warranted due to ratings migration during the quarter. This
was partially offset by lower end-of-period balances compared to last quarter. In consumer, the change in reserve
coverage reflects improvement in the expected loss content in the portfolio.
Including the impact of approximately $150 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio,
our ACL ratio was 2.62%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans, with virtually no associated credit
reserve, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.75%.

Our reserves reflect the current macroeconomic expectations embedded in the scenarios that we deploy in this
exercise. If the outlook does not further deteriorate, there should not be a need to increase our reserve coverage
beyond the current levels.
Turning to slide 14, our capital and liquidity positions remained strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended
the quarter at over 10.1%, above our stated target of around 9.5%. Given the dynamics during the quarter, we are
providing you a CET1 reconciliation between net income, risk-weighted assets and the impact of dividends.
As you can see, dividend payouts constitute a very small portion of the change in CET1. We expect to have
adequate capital and trailing reported net income to maintain our current dividend for the foreseeable future. We
will be resubmitting our stress test in early November, with the rest of the CCAR banks. We have been very
consistent in stating our view that given our very strong capital ratios, balance sheet strength, earnings power and
relatively modest pre-COVID dividend payout ratio, we expect to fare well. We believe that our performance in this
downturn ultimately will prove the resiliency of our model.
Our tangible book value per share was $23.06 this quarter, up 9% year-over-year. At the end of the quarter, our
unrealized pre-tax gain in our securities and hedge portfolios was approximately $3.8 billion, which is not included
in our regulatory capital ratios. From a liquidity perspective, we have over $100 billion in total liquidity sources.
Slide 15 provides a summary of our fourth quarter outlook. We expect a decline in total average loan balances of
approximately 2% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, with a 4% to 5% decline in commercial loans and a 1% to 2%
increase in consumer balances.
The decline in commercial balances is as a result of expected paydowns in commercial credit lines. Net interest
income and NIM are expected to be stable to last quarter, assuming no benefits from accelerated amortization of
PPP fees. We expect non-interest income to increase 7% to 8% sequentially, including the recognition of our TRA
income of approximately $70 million. We expect our expenses to be flat to slightly up. Total net charge-offs are
expected to be in the 40 to 50 basis point range.
In summary, our third quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over
the past few years improving our resiliency, diversifying our revenues and proactively managing the balance
sheet.
We will continue to rely on the same principles: disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and our
focus on the long-term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment.
We fully intend to preserve the optimal level of efficiency of our operations in this weak revenue environment,
while we maintain the investments that we believe are vital to preserve the earnings power and the operational
resiliency of our company.
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is
open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. In terms of your expense initiatives, just given that most of that falls to the bottom line, is it
actually possible that we see expenses down on an absolute basis in 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Ken, this is Greg. First off, we provide 2021 guidance after our fourth quarter earnings. On that call, we'll talk more
about that. But as we talked about our expense optimization plans, $200 million that we expect to get out by the
end of the first quarter, 75% of the actions necessary to accomplish that objective has already been completed.
So we're highly confident in our ability to take out that $200 million by the end of the first quarter. And then we
mentioned another $100 million to $150 million that will show up in 2022, once again focused mainly on
automation, and investments we've made in our technology platforms. So we're very confident. But we'll provide
guidance as far as our expense numbers as we get through the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I think â€“ and Ken, the other point that I want to make about the program is, we stated that the composition
is 80%-20% between permanent savings and environment-related savings of 20%. But that environment-related
savings number is really how we see 2021. So the other lever that we have here is if things actually look worse or
will be worse next year compared to our assumptions, we still will continue to adjust those numbers.
So that part of it is going to be variable and it does have more potential, depending upon the economic
environment. Obviously, our preference would be that the economy would be stronger and we don't have to
necessarily go back to that world. But we still have the availability to us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right, great. And just one follow-up, Tayfun, you'd mentioned that you don't expect to invest the excess cash.
Can you just help us understand like why not invest in, I don't know, something very short-term securities with low
risk that would generate a lot more than or at least a little more than cash returns?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Ken, we don't believe that the tradeoff between the small NII incrementality versus the mark-to-market exposure
is worth taking at this point. It really does not â€“ from your perspective, our ability to invest the money in the short
term doesn't really add much to the long-term performance to the company. So, because we believe that cash is
going to ultimately leave the company over time. So therefore we are more interested in shielding ourselves from
a mark-to-market exposure because the market volatility continues to be a concern for us related to all
investments.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, thanks, guys. Good morning. A follow-up on the loan side. So obviously you guys have, I think, been more
forthright than others about the declines in loans that you're expecting and the quality of the commercial book.
Can you just give us some thoughts just as you look across the footprint of where, if at all, you see activity starting
to change from a pacing perspective and at what point would you see the loan book, especially the commercial
side, C&I starting to bottom out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
This is Greg. First off, on the loan side, on the commercial, look at our pipelines, we're seeing some growth and
positive forward progress in the area of healthcare; telecom and technology would be two other areas that we're
seeing some good growth. And also, the industrials would be the areas that we're most encouraged by as we look
ahead here. So we feel pretty good. As we mentioned on the consumer side, we expect growth of 1% to 2% next
quarter and that business continues to perform well. So that's where I think we have the biggest opportunities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. And then in terms of the deposit side, you've got still good growth and you mentioned some
opportunities to still re-price. What other offsets do you have on the right side of the balance sheet, if any, to
continue to roll down either the fixed term â€“ fixed short-term borrowings, long-term debt footprint in addition to
deposit pricing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
We don't really have a lot of long-term debt opportunities other than just running the maturity schedules at this
point. So we've pretty much executed what was available to us. We're looking at some small items maybe â€“ bad
debt we securitized in the past. But those are small opportunities, so there's not a whole lot remaining there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then last quick one, Tayfun, you mentioned that you're not really interested in building the securities
portfolio. Other banks have started to put some of their liquidity to work in contrast. Can you just walk through
your philosophy on that and how you expect to just manage overall balance sheet size then if you're not net
reinvesting?

Again, as I mentioned, when Ken asked a question, at this point, we don't believe that the trade-off between
incremental NII associated with marginal investments and continuing to expose ourselves to an unattractive mark-
to-market environment related to those investments is attractive. So, at this point, we will continue to watch. Now,
those decisions are made on a week-to-week, month-to-month basis. If we find opportunities, we will be in the
market. But at this point, given what we know today, we are currently choosing to be on the sidelines.

Hi, Mike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. I guess I have a wow on the positive side and a wow on the negative side. So the wow on the positive side
would be only 35 basis points of loan losses and the lowest consumer charges off in 15 years. So that's quite
noteworthy. But the wow on the negative side is a negative provision seems like an outlier. And do you really want
to set a tone at this stage of the cycle of taking a negative provision? I mean, you might be right, but you might be
wrong. But we don't really know how this is going to play out. So I guess my questions are, you said if you had
your downside scenario at 100%, that would be $1.3 billion of additional reserves. How much overlay do you have
for that downside scenario now? That's number one. Number two, when you mentioned that there were
commercial extensions, what does that mean? Is that delaying some of the inevitable? And you did say that loan
losses would go up from here. And then third, just the whole tone perspective, like it sets the tone that that hey,
things are okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
So, again Mike, this is Tayfun. Let me take the first part of that and then I'll turn it over to Jamie for his comments.
Look, I mean I think as you know at the end of the first quarter, at the end of the second quarter, we came out
much more aggressively in terms of building reserves relative to the peers. And when you look at our coverage
ratio, whether you take the 2.49%, whether you take 2.62% or 2.75%, we are still above the median levels of our
peers. And internally obviously, when you look at the risk profile of our loan book, we feel very good about it. And
two, we really did not take the coverage ratio down. It's only down from 2.50% to 2.49%. And the balances
obviously are lower at the end of the quarter, which had an impact.
In terms of weighting the scenarios, we actually increased â€“ we lowered the weight of the base scenario and
increased the weight of the down scenario this quarter. So we are quite cognizant of potential downturns in the
economy. But look, I mean, the underlying profile, credit profile of our balance sheet and the outstanding balances
resulted in a release and we have to abide by certain accounting principles and do the right thing. So that's from
my side. Jamie, any comments from your side?

James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, and Mike, thanks for the question. When we looked at the net provision, it really is an output. And when you
break it down into the two inputs, with the CECL reserve, the release was $116 million in the quarter. And as we
said, it's driven primarily by the payoffs and paydowns in the commercial loan book. And as Tayfun mentioned,
the economic outlook did improve during the quarter, both from unemployment and GDP perspective, which does
lower our loss expectations in the portfolio.
But given the uncertainty in the environment, especially related to additional government support, we increased
the weightings on the upside and downside in the scenarios from 10% last quarter to 20% this quarter. And those
scenarios really have an asymmetrical profile, so it ultimately increases the required CECL reserve and
essentially offsets the benefit from the improvement in the economic outlook.
And to your other question then, if we were to run a scenario where it's â€“ there are no upside or downside
scenarios and we just set 100% as base, then the reserve requirement would be $250 million less than what it is
today. So to your point, the downside scenario does result in a higher CECL reserve than roughly $250 million or
so range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
The other part of the question, I mean it's your job to work with the borrowers, try to bridge the gap between the
pre and post-COVID economies, but when you have commercial extensions, I think that's where a lot of people
are focused on. To the extent that you extend â€“ you drop covenants, you lose some covenants, I don't really â€“
there's a whole litany of things that you can do to make the life of borrowers easier, in some cases, probably most
cases, that will make sense, but in some cases, that might not make sense. So what are you doing when you
mentioned commercial extensions earlier?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Hey, Mike, it's Richard, I'll take that one. It really is, as you described, working with the borrowers, trying to
understand their cash flow needs, their cash flow availability, the collateral that's available that maybe we don't
have as part of a security package. So it's really just reworking the transactions, making sure that we're being
thoughtful about things like maturity dates and extending maturity dates so that â€“ or re-amortizing transactions
with the cash flow. So it's really part of the workout process to make sure that we can be as accommodative as
we can within the risk appetite, support our customers and minimize losses over the long term.

The opportunity, this is Greg, really focuses on our investments in technology, artificial intelligence. You look at

to reduce our people-related costs and really automate a lot of the functions and processes and create more
resiliency and higher-quality outcomes. So we are very focused on process reengineering, automation. We've
identified those process opportunities. We've got teams working aggressively on them and we fully expect that
we'll achieve those objectives going forward. But that will show up more in 2022 than it will in 2021, given the time
it takes to put some of these processes, these re-engineering exercises in place.

Good morning, Scott.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Appreciate you taking the questions. You guys are one of the few guys that have offered a charge-off
assumption for next year and you said it a few times well below a percent. So, I guess in that vein, curious how
you guys are thinking about how this cycle will end up trajecting? In other words, will we be taking care of most of
the losses from this cycle next year? Or will they bleed into 2022 at a higher rate as well?
And I guess part of that question is because you guys have such a strong reserve that if losses indeed stay well
below a percent, I guess I'm curious under CECL, at what point it becomes more challenging even to substantiate
today's reserves? In other words, you don't just look adequately reserved, but potentially very over-reserved. And
I guess I'm just curious about how you guys think about those dynamics?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
There's a lot of moving pieces, Scott, as you think about what's occurring right now with the amount of stimulus
that was thrown at on the pandemic, whether we get the CARES Act, next iteration of that, how's that going to be
distributed with respect to PPP potential, consumer stimulus opportunities. So, there's a lot of variables involved
here.
But what we have visibility of right now as you think about the consumer side, we can see forward looking at our
roll rates and we think we're in pretty good shape. The consumers are in a pretty good shape as we get into the â€“
until we get into the second half of next year and it's going to depend on some of the variables I mentioned and
some of the actions that are being taken. So more to come there, but that's probably more of a second half of
2021 when we start to see those losses creep up if we don't get next iteration of the CARES Act.
On the commercial side once again, a lot of challenges with respect to how we think about the sector because it
really gets back to when do we see a vaccine out there? How effective is it? How is it being distributed? Certain
parts of the economy are reopening quicker than the other parts of the economy. Southeast reopening quicker
right now. We're seeing positive outcomes there from a production standpoint. So there's just a lot going on right
now, which you can assure yourself is we're going to be very cautious. We came out with aggressive reserve
levels. We're going to be very thoughtful and mindful about how the macro environment looks going forward and
what the expectations are and what's happening with some of these government stimulus revenues. Jamie, if you
want to give a little more color on it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, thanks for the question. As we look out at 2021 and we say well below 1%, that for us, our models would
indicate loss rate in the 70 basis points to 80 basis points range and that's, as we sit here today with obviously a
lot of uncertainty between the path of the virus and the path of the stimulus. And when we look at and analyze a
lot of data, especially in the consumer portfolio as Greg said, a little bit easier to predict the model, but we get
through all the data, really the simple answer when you boil it all down is that if you are delinquent going into the
pandemic, you're going to be delinquent coming out.

And if you're healthy going in, you're going to be healthy coming out. And that's what we're seeing and internally
we call it a wind-chill effect. So if it's 50 degrees outside and it could be, you get a pretty big tailwind and it feels
like it's 30 degrees outside, really from an unemployment perspective, the wind-chill was reported numbers of
14% and now we're sitting around 8%. But the wind-chill, because of all of the stimulus programs and hardship
relief, it's actually behaving at a 3% level. And that's why you see such good loss rates from us and our forecast
assumption for next year has some stimulus round two baked into it. But if we get more than what we've
assumed, then those numbers could continue to improve from there.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Tayfun, can you share with us, I know you touched on the capital position in your prepared remarks and your
CET1 ratio now is over 10%. Can you remind us what your ideal ratio would be in terms of the amount of capital
you want to carry to run the company? And then second, obviously the Fed has suspended buybacks for all the
large banks, including your own. What's your view that once the gate is lifted, assuming it will be, how quickly
would you go back into re-purchasing your stock?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Gerard, we are at the 10.14% of CET1 today. I suspect that as we look ahead, by the end of the year, we will be
approaching 10.5% likely. And we entered this year, coming out of 2019, with a capital ratio target of 9.5%. And
that was actually elevated relative to our 9% target just about a year ago before that and we think that even then,
back in 2017 and 2018, we were making comments that we can run this company with an 8-handle capital ratio,
but we are very cognizant of where the peers are and where the regulators are. So we said okay, 9% probably.
And then as we saw the probability of a recession going up, we lifted back to 9.5%. So, from 10.5% to 9.5%,
assuming that we look ahead to a normalized economy, that's 1% of capital that we either consume by growing
loans or we return to shareholders. Tough to predict the timing of the regulatory change in their current position,
but I suspect that when we see the results of this CCAR run and when we find out what the regulators are going
to do, if the gate opens, I don't know why it would take us a long time to go back to a buyback scenario in this
environment.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And the follow-up, your comments about extending out on the securities portfolio or the cash portfolio,
your preference not to do that is very understandable. Would that suggest to us that you are all thinking that
interest rates are likely to rise and we'll see a positive yield curve?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
So our perspective on the interest rate outlook is that we will be in this environment for two, three years. I think it's
hard to disagree where the market is pricing the next rate moves. Our concern about â€“ I mentioned our concern
around not exposing ourselves to a mark-to-market. We're also very concerned that in the current environment,
the spreads do not reflect the actual risk-return profiles, but they are very skewed by the Fed's aggressive actions.
And they turn the credit spreads upside down. And in this environment with that kind of uncertainty, despite the
fact that we are expecting this low rate environment to continue for a while, we're choosing to be on the sidelines.
We also expect that down the road here, whether it's going to happen in 2021 or 2022, once the sort of Fed starts
either stepping back a little bit, slowing down their aggressiveness and once the market builds a certain level of
expectation, whether it's about inflation or about the other end of this rate cycle, the yield curve will start to
steepen. We're not necessarily expecting that to happen in the near-term. So a combination of the fact that a
portion of this cash will leave the bank and also we believe that waiting out until a better investment environment
is the better alternative for us. That's why we're sitting out.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. So â€“ yeah, and I would think a portion of your C&I book is much shorter because it's based on contract
maturity. You do have a fair amount of annual revolvers. If it is in that â€“ I mean, is one way to think about it then,
sort of, what's implicit in the loss content? If you were to say, four years, Tayfun, it would imply that the 2.5%
reserve ratio implies an average annual loss ratio or charge-off rate of about 60 basis points. I mean, is that â€“ and
you'll be higher than that during the peak and maybe lower than that when the credit cycle kind of really goes
back to normal.
Is that a fair way to think about it? Because three and five years would have â€“ depending on what number you
use, it does have a pretty material difference in terms of what the underlying assumption is for annual loss
content. So, I guess, I mean, is that a good way to think about sort of what's implicit in your estimate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Saul, I think directionally your comment is logical. If you look at page 13 and look at the different sub-portfolios
within the commercial book, you see that the commercial mortgage loans, the coverage ratio for that one is 3.4%,
whereas for the C&I book, it's 2%. It appears â€“ again, your question and the logic that you're using is reasonable,
it gets a little bit skewed in this environment because we are within â€“ for the commercial book, the bigger impact
comes from the reasonable supportable period, which is driven solely by the economic outlook. So the reason
why I'm hesitating to say you are correct is because that relationship does not necessarily readily translate to a
reasonable annual loss content. So I just want to make that comment on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. That's well understood. But I guess my point is that the weighted average remaining maturity is arguably
the most important input into this calculation. And this isn't a comment on Fifth Third, this is a general comment.
And we received virtually no information on that from any bank. So it is a little bit of a disconnect that I think...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
We can actually...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A

more of content.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Yes. Yeah, one additional question I want to ask on expenses. I mean, $200 million is almost 5% of your
current expense base. And I think in the past, you guys had talked about the vast majority of that flowing to the
20


Fifth Third Bancorp

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
bottom line. And then you have the additional expense saves. So is it fair to say we should, with all said and done,
expect your run rate expenses to be lower than what they are now? And can you just give us a sense as to the
timing? I know you're not going to give â€“ you're going to wait to get 2021 guidance, but next quarter you see it up
a little bit, flat to up, and then first quarter has some seasonality. So we're likely pushing closer to $1.2 billion in
expenses than $1.1 billion by the first quarter potentially, maybe I am wrong. But, is my logic right that we should
expect expenses to be lower on a dollar basis at some point in 2021 versus where we're at now? And any color
on timing and magnitude of that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
So, we will maintain our discipline and not give you color on 2021 today.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
All right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
But what goes against that $200 million expense save is going to be some natural built-in inflation, whether it's
related to the merit increases or other compensation-related inflation. And, two, is going to be investments in our
company. We will continue to make investments in our company. And the technology line item for all the right
reasons is going up. What we feel good about it, though, is that we have now established a discipline in the
company to look at those investments that are technology-related with a very disciplined return requirement. So,
whatever the built-in expense growth is is not going to be driven by head count increases.

Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
I believe we are close, Erika. As we look ahead, we believe that we have now a level of stability that we're
comfortable with. Could it be now within 2, 3, 4 basis points? Yes, it could be. And obviously the margin itself
today is probably less meaningful of a metric than it has ever been because it's the influence of the cash balances
that we're sitting on. But I do believe that with an assumption that we will live in this highly liquid environment for a
while, we are now pretty close to achieving stability here even if we sort of maintain the level of cash. And the
faster we get out of the cash position, the faster we're going to start moving towards that 3% number that we
believe our natural NIM stands at.
But what gives us confidence there, when you think about it, we have $35 billion in the investment portfolio. Our
sort of normal level of earning assets is about $150 billion. So and we have â€“ I believe it's going to take us, two,
three years to get down to where our peers are in their investment portfolio yield in this low rate environment. We
have a huge advantage there. And then we have a significantly longer derivative portfolio compared to most of
our peers. Those two give us a pretty reasonable confidence that once we get out of this liquidity environment, we
will actually show you a pretty decent margin performance here.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. If we set hedging benefits aside, could you discuss the impact of
rates at the long end of the curve remaining low, how much are you receiving each quarter on loan and securities
portfolio paydowns from your back book? And what's the yield differential between what's coming off and what
you're putting on across products, that should also give us a sense for how much we would benefit from curve
steepening?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. So, on the investment portfolio, you have seen our yields went down by 7 basis points and we're not
investing anything. And the cash flows are reasonably small, so that the step down in portfolio yields could be
relatively small compared to [indiscernible] (01:07:29), that's what I will say about that.
In terms of the other fixed portfolios, in the auto portfolio, which is really the portfolio that is growing right now, we
are probably â€“ the current coupons are probably about 20 basis points or so below the portfolio yield. So when
you think about that, that really is the portfolio, loan portfolio, that's the only one that's exposed to a fixed rate
repricing.

Operator: John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Just a couple on the credit front. Do you have what you're criticized or classified assets did in the
third quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Hey â€“ it's Richard. We had a slight uptick in the third quarter. We'll give you the details in the Q. It was
really around the things that you would imagine, hospitality and leisure as the cycle continues to extend.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. All right. And then the other thing on the credit front, but it's not on the loan side, you â€“ I know commercial
mortgage-backed securities make up a larger percentage of your securities portfolio than peers. And I know you
indicated that Tayfun, you indicated that commercial real estate is particularly vulnerable. Do you have any
concerns around how that credit dynamic within commercial real estate could impact your bond investments?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
We don't, I think we have â€“ the commercial real estate, the non-agent commercial â€“ I'm sorry, non-agency
commercial real estate book that we have is a smaller portion. It's about $3 billion or so in the portfolio and it's all
super senior tranches. So the built-in credit content of that portfolio does not give us any concern.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
And John, it's Jamie, I guess since I bought a lot of those bonds, I can tell you that I keep an eye on them in the
delinquency rates, like high single digits in the book. And the credit enhancement is approaching 40%. So we are
a long way away from having any credit issues in that portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. All right, Jamie. Thank you. That's helpful. If I can ask just one more question, I know you mentioned that
you're prioritizing investments in your asset and wealth management, including acquisitions and we actually have
seen some asset manager deals, larger ones, in the industry recently. Is that something you would consider as a
potential acquisition of an asset manager for your business there?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Yeah. This is Greg. First off, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've invested heavily in our fee businesses
and diversification of our fee businesses. That's going extremely well and wealth and asset management is one of
those areas that we're very focused on with respect to additional opportunities, both from an acquisition of an
entity, of the nature you're speaking of or talent in that business, and as you've seen, that business has grown
really well for us over the years, up 10% sequentially. So we'll continue to look for those opportunities. And, yes,
that will be included in that potential opportunity.

Operator: Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hi, just had a similar question that John Pancari asked about classified and criticized. So when you have the
commercial extensions, do those get picked up as special mention? Or does something else have to happen
before those would migrate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
It's Richard again. If the two are separate, we think about, when we think about workouts, the rating is the rating
and then the workout strategy is the workout strategy. Now, I think when we think about things that impact or
reduce charge-offs, clearly that's going to be in the criticize category, whether it's special mention or substandard.
But we don't have the details around the breakup, between those two.
Remember, if you think about special mention, that is a potential weakness. And there's a ton of judgment of what
a potential weakness looks like. It just effectively means higher probability of default, substandard, again another
step down in terms of default probability. But again, that's a place where mitigates like collateral starts to come
into play.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. So some of the extensions could be there now, but others could transition later. It's just...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Absolutely. And as I said, before, when we start thinking about extensions, we're also looking at other mitigates
like structural enhancements, guaranteed, collateral. There's other ways we can work with a borrower to help
them and protect the bank.

Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you for squeezing me in. Just a couple of questions. Jamie, I think you mentioned if you're healthy going in,
you'll be healthy going out. Were you referring to consumers, corporates? And how are you thinking about what
the pandemic does change in the economy and the way things work?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, I was referring to the consumer portfolio, where we have a litany of information and then you are just trying
to make it as simple as possible. No matter how you slice and dice the data, the bottom line is â€“ and there was
such a big focus on hardship relief and hardship programs and re-default rates, re-deferral rates, all of those
things.
But no matter how you slice it, it really just comes down to something as simple as you're healthy coming in,
you're going to be healthy coming out from a consumer perspective. And that's why that consumer performance
really does reflect, frankly, credit losses and credit projections, as if unemployment were in the 3% range. So we
feel very, very good about that.
I think, to your point about how this ultimately plays out in the economy, it really is the competing forces of the
path of the virus versus the path of further stimulus. So if we get an additional round of stimulus, we think the loss
curves continue to flatten, perhaps elongate.
But again, the peak charge-offs aren't going to be all that high relative to the great financial crisis, especially for a
bank like Fifth Third, where we've put a lot of thought and effort over the last five years to position the company as
well as we have so that we think our loss rates are a fourth of what they were in the great financial crisis. So we
feel good about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So that means even with, if you think post pandemic, even if unemployment runs at a higher run rate, you think it'll
be fine is what you're assuming?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
We do, but again the stimulus and what that looks like will certainly be a big swing factor in those loss projections.
So, for example, on the consumer side, we also ran different modeling efforts where we took out stimulus

altogether, and so, we modeled that as a 20 basis point change in our outcomes if there were to be no stimulus,
so just to put guardrails on what these outcomes might look like.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
One more, if I may, completely different topic. What are you seeing in terms of, deposits on a period end basis
were flattish, but more if you think about consumer and corporate deposits, Tayfun, Jamie, what are you all
seeing in terms of the trends there? Slowing? Static? Still growing? Any color on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Vivek, we are seeing stable consumer deposits. They're not going down, but we're not seeing any noticeable
increases in consumer deposits, our balances are at very healthy levels there. But we are not seeing further
increases. The commercial balances have continued to pick up and I suspect that will in the fourth quarter. It's an
election quarter. And there's a lot of hesitancy on the corporate side to do anything different at this point. I do
believe that come early 2021, hopefully we will see some more emerging signs, hard to predict yet which side it
will go. But that will be dependent on the economy. So for the foreseeable future, we see maybe small upticks in
corporate balances and stable consumer balances.
