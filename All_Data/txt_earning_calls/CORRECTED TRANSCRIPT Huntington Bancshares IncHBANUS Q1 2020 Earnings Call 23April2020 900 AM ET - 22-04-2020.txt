Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. Before we begin, I'd like to express my
sympathies to those of you who've lost family members or friends or who've been directly impacted by the virus.
We'll open today with an overview of how we've reacted to the onset of the pandemic, what the challenges it has
created, as well as the opportunities. Pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption around the world. Extreme
market volatility has altered the global economic landscape. The virus has changed the way we live our daily
lives, changed how business is conducted in the short-term, probably the long-term as well. For Huntington, I
believe our purpose and our deeply rooted culture are an extraordinary asset. Our purpose of looking out for
people has guided our planning and responses to the pandemic.
From the beginning, we've recognized the pandemic is first and foremost a public health crisis. Therefore, our
priority has always been the safety and well-being of our colleagues and our customers. Many of our colleagues
are on the front lines with our customers every day, and it's challenged us to serve our customers in new ways.
To assure their safety in our branches, we moved early to drive-thru only, with in-person meetings by
appointment. We closed all in-store branches and traditional branches which did not have drive-thru. For most
other colleagues, we implemented a work-from-home policy and now have more than 80% of our colleagues
working remotely. This is possible because of the commitment and flexibility of our colleagues and because of the
tremendous work by our technology teams to keep everyone connected and productive. We benefited from the
diligent work performed by our business continuity planning teams over the years.
We also increased our communication with colleagues not only to keep them informed but also to keep them
engaged and in a position to help our customers.
Finally, we added new benefits for our colleagues such as emergency paid time off and other programs for those
whose families were directly impacted by the virus. And we took actions to enhance the mental and physical well-
being of our colleagues.
It was clearly immediately that our customers would face financial hardships because of the pandemic. We took
swift action early and publicly announcing a variety of relief program measures and included loan payment
deferrals, fee waivers and the suspension of foreclosures and repossessions. These measures addressed our
customers' crippled short-term needs. We believe they also demonstrated our purpose of action, showing our
customers that we are there for them now and we'll continue to support them in the future. We believe it's in our
best mutual interest to work with our customers during tough times. Relationships are strengthened in these
moments.
Thousands of colleagues from across the bank mobilized to help small business and commercial customers
access the SBA Paycheck Protection Program. And over the last three weeks, we've redeployed and trained over
700 colleagues to support the heavy volume of SBA applications. I'm pleased to say that we processed almost
26,000 applications in record time with a loan volume of more than $6.1 billion. We were able to process almost
every one of these applications into the SBA E-Tran system before it closed when funding was exhausted on April
16.
We entered 2020 with a relatively healthy economic backdrop across our footprint and prospects for the national
economy appeared to be picking up. However, the pandemic has altered the trajectory for the foreseeable future
and we believe the economy will be challenged for some time. We've tried to assess what is in store for the
economy now. We informed our thinking with multiple potential economic scenarios. The best case is

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
characterized by a deep V-shaped economy with the trough in the second quarter followed by a relatively strong
recovery later this year. More likely scenario could be described as a long U-shaped recovery in which the trough
extends later into the year and then the economy does not recover back to pre-COVID activity levels until well into
2022. Over the course of the last two months, the economic outlook has progressively deteriorated and it appears
that the reopening of the economy will be more protracted than initially expected and a U-shape recovery is the
increasingly likely scenario.
So given this highly uncertain environment and rapidly evolving outlook, we do not believe we can provide any
meaningful expectations for the full year at this time. Therefore, we've withdrawn our formal 2020 full year
guidance. Our visibility is generally limited to the next few months. The range of potential outcomes on the key
metrics is quite wide. Instead, Zach will provide some near-term expectations later in the presentation.
Conservative view on the economic outlook also forms our thinking on how we manage capital, liquidity and
credit. Zach and Rich will discuss our current metrics on these items later, but I'd like to discuss generally how
we're thinking about risk management. As we've previously discussed, over the past decade, we fundamentally
changed Huntington's enterprise risk management. We believe it's now a strength for the company as compared
to a clear weakness during the prior cycle.
Slide 10 in the presentation details several of the key improvements we've implemented, but they all began with
the establishment of our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite in 2009 and the alignment of our credit strategy
and policy with that appetite. We've also centralized credit underwriting and portfolio management, implementing
credit concentration limits and materially repositioned the balance sheet over time.
We implemented a deep relationship focused across the bank focusing on the primary bank relationships and
exiting loan-only relationships that did not meet appropriate return hurdles. In subsequent years, we took actions
such as tightening our consumer lending standards to focus on super prime customers across all our consumer
lending products and tightened our underwriting on commercial real estate. We established conservative
standards and policies for leveraged lending as well. We've pointed out over time that the only comparison of
potential loss for the sector is the Federal Reserve's DFAST stress test. As shown on slide 11, our modeled
cumulative loan losses in DFAST severely adverse scenario are consistently among the best in the peer group.
As we assessed the current environment with respect to the credit impact, we've tried to be conservative. And you
can see this in the level of provisioning and our allowance for credit losses.
We're taking a similar conservative approach to capital. Our capital ratios are strong. We intend to maintain high
capital ratios as a source of strength to support our customers' needs and to be positioned to take advantage of
growth opportunities.
With that, let me turn it over to Zach.

Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 4 provides the highlights for the 2020 first quarter. Clearly,
results were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While our underlying earnings momentum were
strong, first quarter results included provision for credit losses of $441 million, over 3.5% net charge-offs
recognized during the quarter. This was driven by the severely weakened economic outlook compared to the
fourth quarter of 2019. Rich will go into more detail regarding the drivers of the increase in our provision shortly.
But now, let's turn to slide 5 to review our pre-tax, pre-provision earnings.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Year-over-year pre-tax pre-provision earnings growth was 2%. We believe this is strong performance in light of
the challenges of the interest rate environment and the rapid decline in short-term rates year-to-date. Total
revenue increased 1% versus the year ago quarter, as growth in fee income more than offset modest pressure on
spread revenues. Specifically, robust mortgage banking income growth of 176% and 50% growth in capital
markets fees drove the $42 million or 13% year-over-year growth in non-interest income.
FTE net interest income decreased $33 million or 4% year-over-year as 25 basis points of NIM compression
overwhelmed 3% growth in average earning assets. On a linked quarter basis, the NIM expanded 2 basis points
as we continue to be pleased with the results of our hedging program and our diligent efforts to reduce our
deposit costs.
I would like to call your attention to two slides on the appendix that provide important additional information
regarding our efforts in these two areas to support the margin. Slide 28 summarizes the hedging actions we've
taken to reduce the unfavorable impacts of interest rate volatility and lower interest rate environment. We
continuously monitor and prudently refine our interest rate risk management as the interest rate environment,
balance sheet mix and other factors necessitate. Slide 29 provides an update on the reduction of deposit costs as
CDs and money market promotional rates repriced lower and we actively managed commercial deposit costs.
The slide illustrates the downward trajectory of our total interest-bearing deposit costs by month since July 2019,
including a 21 basis point decline from February to March. We expect this downward trend to continue given the
deposit repricing opportunities that remain in 2020.
Total expenses are essentially unchanged from the year ago quarter. This expense discipline reflects the actions
we took in the 2019 fourth quarter to reduce our overhead expense run rate, including the reduction of 200
positions and the closure of 31 in-store branches, as well as actions we took during Q1 to quickly react to the
current environment, balanced against the impact of continued investment in our technology capabilities.
During the quarter, we began the first steps of a multi-part expense management plan for 2020, which provided
some benefit in the quarter by reducing the most immediately flexible expense lines. I will provide more details on
this later.
Finally, I would like to note that normal slides detailing comparisons for our net interest income, net interest
margin, fee income and non-interest expense can be found in the appendix.
Turning to slide 6, our average earning assets increased $2.6 billion or 3% compared to the year ago quarter.
Average total securities increased 5% from the year ago quarter, reflecting portfolio growth and the mark-to-
market on our available-for-sale securities. We're no longer reinvesting securities cash flows and instead are
using this liquidity to fund loan growth. Average loans and leases increased $900 million or 1% year-over-year,
primarily driven by the consumer portfolio. Consumer loan growth remained focused on the residential mortgage
portfolio, reflecting robust originations over the past four quarters.
Average commercial and industrial loans increased 1% from the year ago quarter as commercial activity was
restrained by economic uncertainty during the first two months of the quarter. However, on a linked quarter basis,
we saw end of period C&I loans grow 7%, reflecting significant drawdown activity on credit lines. During March,
we saw $2.5 billion of commercial credit lines. While we've seen draw activity continue in the first weeks of April
with another $700 million drawn through April 15, the pace has started to slow significantly. It is uncertain how
long customers will retain these funds as extra liquidity and a backstop against ongoing disruption in the credit
markets. We continue to actively manage our commercial real estate portfolio around current levels, with average
CRE loans reflecting a 2% year-over-year decrease.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Turning now to slide 7, average core deposits increased 1% year-over-year. Note that this growth rate was
negatively impacted by the June 2019's sale of the Wisconsin retail branch network, which included approximately
$725 million or almost 1% of core deposits. On a linked quarter basis, end of period total deposits increased 5%,
reflecting the aforementioned draws of commercial lines that were subsequently maintained on the balance sheet
in various commercial deposit products. Importantly, the amount of commercial deposit inflows over the past
several weeks has essentially matched the amount of commercial line draws, allowing us to maintain excess
liquidity to meet future customer lending needs.
We continue to see a migration in deposit balances from CDs and savings into money market accounts, reflecting
shifting customer preferences and a shift in the focus of our promotional pricing. Average money market deposits
increased 8% year-over-year, while savings decreased 7% and core CDs decreased 35%. We expect this
dynamic to continue through 2020.
Average interest-bearing DDA deposits increased 7% year-over-year, while non-interest-bearing DDA increased
1%. As shown on slide 36 in the appendix, we are very pleased that our consumer non-interest-bearing deposits
increased 5% year-over-year. This growth highlights our continued focus on new customer acquisition and
relationship deepening.
Slide 8 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio or CET1 ended the
quarter at 9.47%, down 37 basis points year-over-year. The tangible common equity ratio or TCE ended the
quarter at 7.52%, down 5 basis points from a year ago.
During the first quarter through mid-March, we repurchased 7.1 million common shares at an average cost of
$12.38 per share or a total of $88 million. When the COVID-19 pandemic first started to impact the US, we
paused our buyback for the remainder of the first quarter. We do not currently intend to repurchase any shares for
the balance of 2020.
This morning, we announced the board declared the second quarter cash dividend of $0.15 per share, unchanged
from the prior quarter. We expect to sustain the dividend at this level.
During periods of macro stress and market volatility, managing liquidity is paramount. Our position of strength and
liquidity draws its foundation from our deposit base and the depth of our relationship with our customers. Our ratio
of loans to deposits is stable at 90%. In addition, we have considerable additional sources of liquidity, including
our portfolio of liquid securities and borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve's
Discount Window.
Slide 9 highlights our relative capital strength. Over the past few years, we have maintained our capital position
and are now in the top third of regional banking peers on total risk-based capital. Our dividend yield is also in the
high end of the peer group.
Let me now turn it over to Rich to cover credit, including CECL. Rich?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Slide 10 details some of these decisions we have made and credit risk management enhancements we have
implemented. In 2017, we heightened our underwriting standards for leveraged lending. Since we drafted our
leveraged lending policy in 2015, we have used a conservative senior leverage multiple of 2.5 times to qualify as
a leveraged loan for our borrowers with less than $500 million of revenue. Also in 2017, we began leveraging the
underwriting infrastructure and standards of our auto finance business, the RV and marine portfolio that was
expanded through the FirstMerit acquisition. Recall that our indirect auto and floorplan dealer – dealer floorplan
portfolios are among the best performing to DFAST. We prepared for the eventual economic downturn. We
adjusted our health care portfolio by curtailing new construction originations in the long-term care segment. Our
health care construction portfolio is now down 60% from where it was in 2016. Over the past couple of years,
we've continued to refine our credit underwriting, consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. We
have increased FICO score cuts across our HELOC and RV and marine books and held our commercial
businesses to higher standards with respect to credit policy exceptions. So we entered the current credit
environment with a portfolio that has been continually fine-tuned over the last several years.
Slide 11 illustrates the relative rankings of modeled cumulative loan losses for Huntington and our peers in the
Federal Reserve's severely adverse scenarios or DFAST exercise. As Steve has mentioned over time, this is the
only true comparison of credit risk across the sector that we know of and it provides us independent validation of
the credit risk management we have implemented. We like that our portfolio was evenly split between consumer
and commercial businesses. It gives us nice diversification in periods of stress and our DFAST numbers reflect as
much. Still the aforementioned steps have strengthened the quality of our loan portfolios.
Turning now to the first quarter credit results metrics, slide 12 provides a walk of our allowance for credit losses or
ACL following the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 and the first quarter's provision. The ACL increased to
2.05% of total loans, up from 1.18% at 2019 year end. The increase was comprised of the $393 million day one
adjustment and a $323 million reserve build in the day two provision during the first quarter. As you recall, the day
one increase was a function of our 50% weighting in the consumer portfolio, which has a much longer weighted
average life and therefore, a larger lifetime loss under CECL. For the quarter, our reserve build consisted of a
$258 million increase due primarily to the ongoing economic uncertainty and a $65 million net increase in our
specific reserves, almost exclusively against our oil and gas portfolio. The Q1 ACL now includes a 20% reserve
against our oil and gas portfolio. The multiple data points we used besides the adjustment we made in Q1,
including the Moody's baseline scenario that showed unemployment rising to near 9% and GDP levels falling by
18% in Q2, and different levels of recovery in subsequent quarters. We also weighted unprecedented level of
government stimulus, both to consumers as well as businesses and the potential support to the economy that will
provide. These factors drove our Q1 provisions.
The more recent April economic models now show further deterioration with unemployment reaching 12.5% and
GDP falling by 30% in Q2, and an improvement in Q3 that provides less of a net recovery than the March base
case showed. We will continue to evaluate data points like these as we size our provision expense for the second
quarter.
Slide 13 shows our NPAs and TDRs and demonstrates the impact that our oil and gas portfolio has had on our
overall level of NPAs. We have discussed for several quarters the challenges we see with this portfolio and have
been proactive in recognizing the earnings impact we anticipate as commodity prices continue to range below
economical levels for this industry.
Oil and gas NPAs represent just under half of our commercial NPAs and one-third of our overall NPAs. They are
also a significant contributor to our Q1 NPA increase. Notably, over 90% from a dollar standpoint, of these NPAs
7

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
remain current with respect to principal and interest payments. On top of our oil and gas portfolio, commercial
NPAs were reduced in the first quarter by $65 million.
Slide 14 demonstrates that we have a fairly modest exposure to some of the areas that have been hardest hit by
COVID-19 today. We have recently completed deep dives into nearly all these portfolios and are comfortable with
our team's assessment of the current situation. Our restaurant exposures, primarily the national quick service
brands that have maintained drive-up operations and our sandwich and pizza chain customers have been open
for takeout service to offset the declines in in-house seating.
Slide 15 details our leveraged lending portfolio. Our conservative definition uses 2.5 times senior leverage for
borrowers with under $500 million of revenues to account for heightened risks in leveraging smaller companies.
Our leveraged loan book represents under 4% of our total loans and as a percentage of capital was at its lowest
point in several years. We focus on borrowers that are weighted toward manufacturers as opposed to service and
other asset-light borrowers. They tend to provide more collateral.
Within the manufacturing segment of our leveraged lending book, there are no sub-segments that account for
more than 20%. We deliberately avoided covenant-lite term loan B structures because the play in that market
generally requires providing an understructured pari-passu revolving credit commitment as well. That revolver is
typically undrawn at closing that represents potential contingent risk in a down cycle. We hope regular reviews of
this portfolio and underwriting follows a consistent corporate process with a designated leveraged lending credit
executive responsible for its review.
Slide 16 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Net charge-offs represented an
annualized 62 basis points of average loans and leases in the current quarter, up from 39 basis points in the prior
quarter, and up from 38 basis points in the year ago quarter. The increase was centered on the oil and gas
portfolio, and one large coal-related commercial credit, which together made up approximately three-fourths of the
total commercial net charge-offs. The oil and gas portfolio continues to be impacted by low commodity prices and
limited capital markets activity. As I mentioned earlier, we have allocated significant reserves against this portfolio.
Annualized net charge-offs excluding the oil and gas and coal-related losses were 30 basis points, demonstrating
that the balance of our portfolio performed well in Q1. Our remaining coal exposure is under $200 million, of which
20% carries an investment-grade guarantee.
Non-performing asset ratio increased 9 basis points linked quarter and 14 basis points year-over-year to 75 basis
points due to the oil and gas impact I described earlier. Consumer charge-offs were down to 35 basis points in Q1
as compared to 41 basis points a year ago, demonstrating our continued strong consumer portfolio. As always,
we've provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package on the slides.
Let me turn it back over to Zach.

Thank you, Rich. As Steve mentioned earlier, we have withdrawn our 2020 full year guidance. Historically, we've
refrained from providing quarterly guidance as it implies a much shorter time horizon than we manage the
company. That said, we want to provide you with much insight into key business trends as we can. So, we will
focus on where we can frame realistic expectations. Therefore, slide 17 provides comments on the second
quarter.

Huntington Bancshares, Inc.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Starting with loans, the $3.2 billion of commercial line draws we saw in March and into early April will drive
average commercial loans 4% to 5% higher over the near term, excluding any impact of the $6 billion of SBA PPP
loans and any additional SBA PPP loans made in the next phase. We currently expect the majority of commercial
line draws to remain outstanding for the next several months. The duration of the PPP loans is uncertain, but we
expect the large majority of them to be forgiven and to come off the sheet quickly. We expect consumer loans to
be flat-to-modestly lower. The auto portfolio and to a lesser extent the RV, marine portfolio is expected to reduce
as vehicle sales activity declines. We expect the pre-existing trend of run-off in home equity to continue and we
expect the residential mortgage portfolio to be flat to modestly higher in the second quarter as robust level of
refinancing activity acts as a governor on growth.
We expect average core deposits to increase 2% to 3% linked quarter.
Similar to our expectations for commercial loans, we expect the recent influx of the commercial deposits, again
excluding the impact of PPP, to remain on the balance sheet through the second quarter. We expect average
consumer core deposits to be flat to slightly higher as slowing customer deposit acquisition is offset by similar
reductions in attrition given altered branch traffic and consumer behaviors. On the other hand, we expect the bulk
of the proceeds of the PPP program will steadily flow out of the bank over the next eight weeks, consistent with
the intent of the program. We now expect deposit growth to fully fund loan growth in the second quarter.
Moving to the income statement, provisioning is a key driver of variability in the Q2 earnings outlook, but revenue
and non-interest expenses also have a wider than normal range with possible outcomes. We've modeled various
realistic scenarios for the revenue and expense outlook, some of which provide the opportunity for us to achieve
our annual goal of positive operating leverage and some of which do not. We continue to believe the positive
operating leverage is an important part of our long-term value creation model, but we will not allow a short-term
view of this one metric to dictate our decisions. We constantly strive to find the right balance between the short-
and long-term results.
Within these confines, we expect total revenue to decline 4% to 5% linked quarter as the larger average balance
sheet is more than offset by moderate pressure on the organic NIM and the COVID-19 related declines in fee
income. Customer activity based fee income lines items including deposit service charges, card and payment
processing are all expected to be pressured.
Mortgage banking is expected to remain robust, but historically wide secondary marketing spreads are expected
to gradually reduce. All combined, our current expectation is for fee income to be down approximately 10%
sequentially.
We have a little more control and less visibility into the expense outlook for the second quarter. We expect non-
interest expenses to increase between 5% and 6% on a sequential basis, driven primarily by the seasonal
increase in compensation-related expense related to the annual grant of long-term incentives and annual merit
increases, partially offset by our expense reduction actions. On a year-over-year basis, expenses will be lower by
2%.
We have begun our rigorous expense management plan. We entered 2020 like prior years having constructed
expense management contingency plans and when the challenges facing 2020 became clear, we began
implementing these plans. Our approach is focused on four categories of expenses: discretionary expenses such
as travel and sponsorships; investments, including marketing, the pacing and prioritization of digital and
technology investments and planned business expansions; structural expenses such as the size and composition
of our branch network and corporate facilities infrastructure; and finally, organizational expenses, which include
9


Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
(HBAN) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
the size of the organization and compensation levels across the company. The actions we'll take across these
categories vary in terms of how quickly they can be implemented. The quickest expense levers we can pull are
within discretionary spending. Our travel and entertainment spending has been reduced dramatically as a result of
the lockdown and social distancing measures. We're also curtailing non-essential consulting and outside services
expenses.
In the investment category, given the macro environment depressing customer acquisition activities, we're
prudently reducing near-term marketing expenses. We're also scrutinizing all pre-existing business expansion
plans and have delayed some initiatives. However, we are maintaining our digital and mobile technology
investments. While less immediate in impact, the decisions regarding structural and organizational expenses will
provide opportunities to reduce our future expense trajectory. We'll not be providing details at this time regarding
the ultimate scale or timing of our expense actions, but know that we are taking decisive actions.
Finally, the most uncertain item in the earnings outlook is credit provisioning. We currently expect net charge-offs
in the second quarter to be near the high end of our average through-the-cycle target range 35 to 55 basis points.
This is reflective of the ongoing pressure in the oil and gas portfolio as well as broader economic considerations.
Fundamentally, our credit remains sound. However, the economic outlook has continued to deteriorate since
quarter end and remains highly intervened. This will result in elevated provisioning and additional reserve building
in the second quarter and most likely for the next several quarters. It is much too early to estimate the ultimate
size of the additional reserve build, but you should expect us to remain conservative in our approach to credit risk
management.
I will now turn it over to Mark, so we can get to your questions. Mark?

Richard A. Pohle A

Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
I think, Erika, you have to – the challenge that we have with the allowance in this quarter is the models really
weren't trained for this, right. And so, we had the severe decline in the economic scenario and the government
stimulus that is forthcoming, but really hasn't shown up yet at the end of the first quarter. So, there's a lot of
judgment that went into setting the provision this quarter, various economic models that came out throughout the
month of March. We just look at a number of factors when we set the provision. We've got the coverage ratios at
the end of the quarter where we want them.

Got it. And my follow-up question is, appreciate the detail on reserves relative to DFAST losses. And when I look
at the Fed run test and even your company run test from 2018, it seems like there's a pretty significant
contribution still from commercial real estate and I'm wondering as we think about how future charge-offs in this
type of recession can play out for Huntington, what are sort of the model biases in the stress test model and I
guess I'm reading the question a little bit by referring to commercial real estate that might distort how we're
thinking about what can actually be incurred in terms of charge-offs. In other words, what part of the stress test is

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
backward – very backward looking in terms of historical losses in CRE and what part of the stress test, obviously,
unemployment is one place, seems to be not severe enough?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
So as it relates to – I think you hit the nail on the head, the DFAST numbers are backwards looking. So the
fundamental change that has transpired over this company since the last downturn has been remarkable and I
would say that commercial real estate is probably the one area where we are so fundamentally different today
than we were going back. I mean, we had close to 5,000 customers on the commercial real estate side going into
the last downturn. We have about 300 customers today. So there is a clear focus on Tier 1 sponsors, Tier 2
sponsors, institutional sponsors and so we really focus on knowing the developer and not only the projects that
we're financing, but the projects that might be financed somewhere else to make sure that we're not overextended
there.
We also, from a percentage of capital standpoint, we're over 200% of capital going into the last downturn. We're
under 100% of capital today and with very strict limits on various sub-limits within the commercial real estate
space. So I think that's the biggest one.
As it relates to some of the other things, clearly unemployment is going to be a big driver of losses on the
consumer side. I think the DFAST results there have been very consistent over time that our consumer charge-
offs in the DFAST scenario must have been at the top of our peer group. So I feel very good about where we
stand in a lot of the consumer categories relative to the DFAST results from 2020.

Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Erika, I might add, this is Steve, the joblessness or unemployment levels in Ohio and Michigan were double digit
when we made the changes to the consumer lending policies, and the models that we have used subsequently
have been based in that. So I think 10.3% in Ohio and 14-and-a-fraction-percent in Michigan. So that has drove
us to a super prime level of our origination. We use our prop score, but the equivalent FICOs you've seen
quarterly for 10 years and we will attack the book. So we believe we've got a very sound consumer loan portfolio
and the performance expectations around that will – is, we believe is important through this cycle, notwithstanding
higher unemployment and somewhat higher losses. And we've been talking for several quarters about oil and gas
as an outsized exposure for us in terms of risk of loss, clearly outside of our aggregate moderate-to-low appetite,
and we've also shared that we expect to address that substantially early this year, and having started to do that
last year. So these oil and gas credits are all SNCCs. Our losses from what we can tell are – I mean, we're taking
it earlier than – certainly earlier than required, including the non-accrual decisions and I think we're frankly going
to be slightly ahead or ahead of others in the industry in that regard.

Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hi, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. I was hoping for maybe a little more detail on the overall modifications and deferrals. Definitely get the
number of customers, but maybe if there are some dollars of total modifications in both the consumer and
commercial portfolios?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
We're happy to answer that for you, Scott. It's Rich. Yeah. On the consumer side, it's about $2 billion of deferrals
that we've processed. We also have made some deferrals for some of the mortgages that we're a servicing agent,
but for our book, it's about $2 billion.
On the commercial side, it's about $6 billion, but I would say half of that is in our auto floorplan dealerships and
we're counting the curtailments in that number. And most of what we're doing in the auto floorplan space is more
curtailment than the payment deferral, really the – we need the cars to be on the lots a little bit longer than they
have been historically just given the current environment. So, digging into some of the other areas where we've
provided deferrals, the commercial real estate and the hospitality space and retail is one other area on the
commercial side and then – and in the franchise restaurant space, we've also been active with deferrals.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's perfect. Thank you. And then just on sort of those latter points you made, maybe if we exclude the
floorplan, because that makes plenty of sense logically. But in the remaining commercial deferrals, do you have a
sense for how much of those deferrals you would say are kind of necessary or needed versus how much is
customers sort of taking advantage of a kind of insurance in this environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
I would say that the commercial real estate deferrals are needed for the most part. The hotel occupancy rates,
given where they are, I felt like I was the only one in the hotel I was at last night. So I think anecdotally, that's a
need. I think the cash crunch in commercial real estate is real. And we generally did not have a high bar on
proving that you needed it, part of our looking out for customers is being there when they need us. And so, our
thought was if you're asking for a deferral, we're generally going to give it to you, but I haven't come back and
scientifically determined who really needed it and who didn't. I would just point to commercial real estate is
probably the area that needed it most.

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
...understandable there. We take a slightly different view on the consumer side, just to share with you. We actually
– the fact that they've asked for deferrals, we take it as a good sign that they intend to stay in the residence or
keep the car or other things. With the rapid increase in unemployment, these indications are actually positive from
our perspective versus 2008, 2009 when it was hard to communicate with customers, they tended to let houses
go, I think the nature of this health crisis will be much more likelihood to protect us than we were seeing in that
prior cycle.

...I was pointing to is, at the time of the deferral, 98% of our consumer and even a higher number of our
commercial customers were current. So it wasn't – so, this was kind of the delinquent customers reaching out for
help. These are good customers that needed the assistance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning.

Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I appreciate the color you just gave regarding the prior, the stress test and the changes in your business mix over
time and how that did impact your through-the-cycle losses. I was just wondering if you can maybe therefore help
us think about what a fair through-the-cycle loss level would be given your current mix and give what you're
looking at now in terms of your assessment of the economic outlook. I know it's tough, but you want to try to get a
better idea of what we're looking at.
And then separately, I know on slide 11, you've pointed the reserve being 42% of the 2018 to really adverse
DFAST, but you also indicated that the April data is pointing to or did point to worsening. What do you think a –
the incremental reserve additions could go to here, what do you think an appropriate relative percentage of
DFAST is likely fair here? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hey, John. I'm going to be challenged to answer both of your questions. I think as it relates to through-the-cycle
losses, I think the challenge that we all face is just the uncertainty that we're dealing with right now as to how long
this is going to last and then what the new behaviors are coming out of this. So, we feel good about the book
going into it. On the consumer side, very good credit quality there. We have pointed out on the commercial side
that we're going to have likely elevated charge-offs in oil and gas. Beyond that, it's really hard to come up with a
forecast for charge-offs through-the-cycle here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
John, we're hoping to get a better view this quarter if this return to work status changes right now. Next week,
Ohio looks like it's going to implement on May 1, Michigan following that middle of May. And as these industries
start spooling up again, we'll get a better sense of what the recovery might look like, but I think this is going to be
dynamic and best case would be to have a view this quarter, I think it's more likely going to be in third or fourth
quarter before we really understand what the growth rates could be to come off, what will be this very challenging
moment of time and the sustainability of these businesses and ultimately how they're going to repay us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. So, as it relates to what you might see in the second quarter, we're clearly going to probably snap that line
at the end of the quarter. We'll take a look at all the new scenarios. We'll look at the impact of the stimulus. Like I
mentioned, a lot of this is just kind of reaching the businesses and customers now. There'll be a lot more data that
we'll have at the end of the second quarter besides what the provision expense would be for the quarter. But it's
really tough to estimate that right now.

Steven Alexopoulos Q

Hi. Good morning, everyone.

Stephen D. Steinour A

Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So let's start, just to follow-up on Erika's and John's question around DFAST, I think what a lot of us are struggling
with is that when we look at CECL, it's supposed to look at lifetime losses. The global economy has basically shut
down. And I think we're trying to understand if you look at that framework and you're coming up with a reserve
that's only 40% of DFAST losses, it seems really low. And I think we're trying to get at, isn't a large reserve build
again coming? Like, how do we reconcile the framework of what's going on in the economy and the size of the
reserve versus your own internal stress test?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Steve, it's Rich. I think DFAST and CECL are really two different exercises. You can try to link them together. But
there are fundamental differences in the assumptions for reach. The DFAST scenario, the severely adverse is a
16


Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
(HBAN) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
deep scenario that continues for an extended period time. And it also assumes that you're continuing to make
loans during that period, there are all sorts of dynamics that go into that.
CECL, on the other hand, is you're looking at something that is reasonable, supportable over a period of time that
eventually returns to the mean. And so you're running in a scenario that will have a two or three year life and then
there's a reversion to the mean on that, and it's also assuming you don't make another loan.
So, while I think the CECL to DFAST comparison is a good data point, I also don't think you can necessarily draw
too much from it, conclusion-wise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's fair. And just for a follow-up. So if you look at slide 14, the COVID impacted sectors. I'm surprised
you're not calling out some of your auto exposures, I think about floorplan or RV. Are you not expecting to see a
material decline in revenues for these sectors, right, particularly auto?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, we've talked about auto. We feel that there is going to be a short-term impact to auto. We don't
necessarily think it's going to fall into the same category as hotels and some of the other areas where it could just
be a protracted longer impact. I think ultimately people are going to get out and buy cars probably on a reduced
level, but we don't see the impact to auto and to a lesser extent RV that we do with some of the other ones that
we've got in here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
The floorplan launched, Steven, are to dealers that have multiple flats. In the 2008, 2009, 2010 cycle, we didn't
have a delinquency. The strategy is consistent. These are very strong typically multi-generation family dealerships
that have enormous wealth created over that time and dealers that we believe will be very supportive to the extent
they need to. Part of our underwriting also looks at coverage ratio of service and parts to fixed charge and most of
these are really strong in that regard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
And just to piggyback on that, I mean, this – obviously we did do a deep dive on the auto portfolio even though it's
not listed here and from a liquidity standpoint, we felt the book is in very good shape.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
We had a charge-off in auto [ph] within – I don't know (00:50:04) two decades in what we've originated and we
certainly have a lot of conviction going forward in the quality of that book.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Thanks. I guess just a really quick question in terms of the energy portfolio, if I heard correctly, was it 20%
reserve you have against this portfolio? There's other banks that we heard like yesterday has just over 2%
reserve in their energy portfolio. Can you just talk about the characteristics of your energy loans and how it might
be different from some of the other banks that you would need such a materially higher reserve on this portfolio?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Ken, well, as we all know these are all SNCCs. So, there is good company in the credits that we're inside. I don't
know that it's necessarily so much that our portfolio is any worse off than others. I think, as Steve has mentioned,
we've been very proactive in recognizing the risks that we see in this book and we have taken losses in this book
over the last five quarters that are pretty significant. And it's reasonable to assume that we're going to have further
losses.
So when you see the headlines around the big banks, starting to form FTEs to take ownership of these credits
rather than go through a liquidation process, I think it tells you where the industry is heading in terms of dealing
with troubled situations here. So we looked at our book and we feel that the long-term fundamentals, particularly
for natural gas are still not strong. And I think we've sized the reserve around this taking into account the – where
we're seeing long-term prices not so much on where they are today, but longer term. And just the fact that there is
a lack of capital markets activity in this space right now is completely different than what transpired in the last
downturn. So we think it's appropriate to put higher levels of reserves here and we'll continue to review it as we go
through the spring borrowing base redeterminations and kind of size that reserve going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
And we think this is much more like the early mid-1980s where beginning with Penn Square in 1983, the industry
got clobbered and stayed in a tough shape for four, five years. And so we're just trying to be realistic with that
view, so what we think the likely outcomes are for this portfolio and certainly we've seen subsequent price
deterioration as a result of OPEC and Russian issues on the oil side. There's some spillover that's benefited gas
in the short-term, but these are going to be longer term workouts. You're going to see a lot of these companies
combined. We do think the SPE is the way to go as we did in the mid-1980s. I'm happy to have direct experience
with this in that timeframe and it leads me and I think us as a consequence to be clear eyed about what to expect
in the future and perhaps a bit conservative relative to some others, but we'll see that over time.

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just my follow-up question. If I heard right, I think you said you expect
elevated provisions for the next several quarters. Can you just talk more – it's more of a conceptual question, but
as I guess we would think that CECL should clearly frontend load a lot of the provision expense, but I get there's a
lot of uncertainty out there. Can you just talk about that dynamic which is how much can you really frontload for
your reserve build versus like I want to get to say fourth quarter, are you still maintaining a really high reserve
even if – and provision expense even if the economy is not weakening at that point? Seems like provision should
be a lot lower by fourth quarter, if I'm not mistaken?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
CECL, I mean, the whole concept around CECL is that you are recognizing the losses today on the books that
you have today, right. So, in a perfect world, if you had perfect foresight into what the economic variables were
and they didn't change, you wouldn't have to make any further adjustments. But clearly, we're in a very dynamic
market where the economic assumptions that we have to use for the life of loan are going to materially change
over the next several quarters and that's what's going to drive the additions or down the road, hopefully, the
release of reserves under the CECL methodology.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Good thing, Ken, is we're in a downdraft moment, but as we reopen in these different states, we'll start to get a
floor and stabilization and resiliency and recovery and that could very well happen at the timeframes you
mentioned, based on the fiscal stimulus, we'll be part of that, the banking industry, Huntington will as well. And for
the sake of the country, it's great to see the industry in such a good shape. So I think we've got a moment here, a
quarter or so, couple of quarters where things are a bit uncertain, but I think the picture will clarify in the
foreseeable future. And that clarity will give us the basis to have more confidence in projections and sharing those
with you collectively and I think it will lead us to a position where having been intentionally conservative, we'll see
a better day on the horizon where I hope there will be some reserve recovery.

Hey. Thanks a lot, guys. One question on the capital front. So you're right in the middle of that 9.5% CET1, 9% to
10% zone that you enjoy. Do you want to try to stay around that and also how does TCE, if at all, come into your
thought process around maintaining capital ratios? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. And this is Zach. I'll take this one. So, yes, our CET1 for Q1 ended at just about 9.5%. Our goal was to be
high end of the 9% to 10% range over time and I would expect continued growth in capital towards the year end,
19


Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
(HBAN) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
that's the plan and intention at this point. I think the fact that we mentioned paused on share repurchases for the
time being for the foreseeable future is a major driver of that. And we continue to model, as you might imagine,
innumerable scenarios around where the year can play out here. But the expectation is sort of continually rising
towards the end of the year, with the [indiscernible] (00:57:41) range. So, that's on CET1.
You talked about TCE, TCE ended just about 7.5% – I think 7.52% precisely and likewise our goal was to be in
the – somewhat higher level. So, I expected that ratio to trend higher throughout the year as well. We think about
both of the metrics beyond us. We look at both of them just as much internally as each other. And CET1 is a
critical regulatory measure. It's also very comparable across banks. And so, it's awful I think for us and for you to
understand the relative position. TCE is a key governor, though, as well and particularly in the last downturn when
capital was precious, that measure loomed large. And so, we're conscious that both matter. And we factor both
into our decisions. I think that said, as I look at the trajectory in both of them, they're pretty similar shaped, and I
would expect both to be rising modestly toward the back half of this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, got it. And just a follow-up on the auto and RV, marine side. Just in terms of the growth outlook, you
generally mentioned it in terms of your outlook on the consumer side. We noticed that the loan originations in the
first quarter 16 in auto, probably the lowest we've seen in a long time. Do you have a way of helping us
understand given the uncertainty albeit just what do you expect the volume growth to traject like in auto and RV,
marine?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. We really don't have a great view on it kind of longer term in the year and that's why we tried to realistically
give you what Q2 will look like. And we do expect continued modest downdrafts in auto just given the dynamics
we've been talking before about auto dealerships being largely shuttered and therefore, sales activity being lower.
It really will depend on the pace of the recovery when it looks like to see to what degree we start to see regrowth
sequentially quarter-to-quarter in the back half of the year.
From a RV, marine perspective, I think we're expecting less downdraft, because that portfolio was always very,
very super prime, very focused on the regions where that was a key lifestyle purchase for people and it was
relatively smaller book, too. So, I think probably expect more flattish to down-ish there, but we're also watching
that pretty carefully.
I think you didn't ask but on the residential mortgage side, we expect continued robust demand as you might
expect and essentially pretty flat growth there just given that demand offsetting portfolio run-off as folks [ph] renew
their mortgages off us (01:00:34).

Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thank you. Thank you, all. We've talked a lot today about the pandemic. We reviewed the resulting economic
challenges, perhaps most importantly what we don't know yet. I'd like to ask you to take a step back and I'll offer
you some perspective. I've been there in this industry for four decades. I've seen uncertainty before and while this
pandemic and the elevated concern it brings is very different than any prior periods in my career, we will get
through this as a country.
One thing we know from history is Americans are resilient at the core. We as a nation, I believe have much better
days ahead. We're going to learn and adapt as we have in the past and build stronger, more nimble organizations
as a result. This will be a time of change and innovation, resulting in the growth and I believe Huntington is well
positioned to move forward.
We will emerge stronger and better as a result of the hard work of our colleagues and their concern for our
customers and their commitment can be clearly seen in the way they quickly reoriented to new working
arrangements, responded to customer needs and of course, helped the businesses in our local communities
through the SBA PPP program. Their unwavering commitment to our purpose has been inspiring and I'm proud
for what our colleagues stand for and the ways they've looked out for our customers. As I reminded you frequently
in the past, our colleagues along with our board are among the largest shareholders of Huntington, collectively
among the 10 largest. This is – the challenges we face today are exactly why we changed our compensation
plans in 2010 to make sure we are aligned with long-term shareholders. Faring for times like this is also why we
took actions enumerated on slide 10, amongst others, to position Huntington to outperform through the cycle. I
remain confident about our long-term prospects as we manage through this challenging environment.
With that, I want to thank you very much for your interest in Huntington. Have a great day.
