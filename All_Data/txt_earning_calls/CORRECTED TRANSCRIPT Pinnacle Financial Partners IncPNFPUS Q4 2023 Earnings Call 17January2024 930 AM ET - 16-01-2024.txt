President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, Matthew. Good morning. Thank you for joining us this morning for the fourth quarter 2023 earnings
call. Obviously, we'll focus on performance in the fourth quarter of 2023 and our outlook for 2024, both of which, I
think, are very good. We always start with the shareholder value dashboard on a GAAP basis and then as
adjusted, which is really what our focus on in trying to manage the firm.
There is no doubt 2023 presented one of the most difficult operating environment for banks since the Great
Recession. I expect few, if any, banks were able to completely outrun the rate environment and its impact on
revenue and earnings growth in 2023. But despite the difficult operating environment, we grew our tangible book
value at 14.8% in 2023 and produced a 20% total shareholder return.
Our unusual approach of investing in our business, particularly in terms of acquiring new talent, even during
difficult times, is one of the primary reasons we've been able to continue to take share and grow balance sheet
volumes, which, of course, has accounted for our rapid and reliable growth in revenue and earnings, which we
believe accounts for our extraordinary total shareholder return over nearly 2.5 decades now.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
We've said for some time that it's our expectation that credit metrics have to normalize. It's about to operate over
time at the very low level of problem loans that we've enjoyed over the last two years. We saw a little bit of that in
the fourth quarter, but the NPAs and classified assets still remain below our five-year median, which is, itself, very
low, and net charge-offs during the quarter were just 17 basis points. So, fourth quarter of 2023 was an excellent
quarter for us, particularly on those metrics that point to future shareholder value creation.
And so with that in mind, let me turn it over to Harold for a more in-depth look at the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. We'll – we'll again start with deposits, reporting linked-quarter
annualized average growth of 4.6% in the fourth quarter, which we believe was a real positive for us. We did see
some end-of-year deposit outflows that lowered our EOP balances and are hopeful to see those balances return
this quarter. EOP deposit rates were up only 7 basis points, the smallest increase in quite some time. We felt like
the rate of increase for deposit rates would slow as we entered the fourth quarter. So we're pleased with where
we ended up.
Deposit [indiscernible] (00:04:54) down quite a bit with fluctuations in our overall rates driven somewhat by mix
shift as several larger, more expensive depositors built balances at year-on-year. We remain disciplined as to the
relationship between pricing and growth of deposits. We will continue at a more deliberate pace for gathering
deposits without leaning heavily on the rate component for our growth.
As to loans, the fourth quarter was another strong loan growth quarter for us as we are reporting a 10.7% linked-
quarter annualized average loan growth for the fourth quarter. As we mentioned over the last several quarters, we
were pleased with our results on fixed rate loan pricing, which ended the quarter with average fixed rate loan
yields on new rate originations of 7.33%. Spread maintenance on floating and variable rate loans continues to be
strong with coupons in the high 7s and low 8s on new loans.
This slide segments our net loan growth based on several categories to help everyone better understand the
source of [audio gap] (00:05:55). Our expansion into DC, Atlanta, Birmingham, et cetera was a source of much of
our loan growth in 2023. That's why we're so excited about our announced entry into Jacksonville. We have our
experienced bankers in these new markets and give them the tools and resources to build a large local franchise.
Much of our loan growth is not new in new borrower – is not to new borrowers, showing up a Pinnacle Bank with a
new idea to pitch. Our borrowers have extended relationships with relationship managers over, in many cases,
decades of working with each other. This is not just true for Charlotte, Nashville, Charleston, and other legacy
markets, but that applies to Atlanta, DC, Birmingham, as well as Jacksonville.
As the top chart reflects, our NIM was flat quarter-over-quarter. We hope to see a modest increase and continue
to believe we have great opportunity to see NIM expansion in 2024. As we entered the fourth quarter, we felt like
we were fairly close to follow our margin and have some confidence that we have. More importantly, we feel we
should see a stronger net interest income as we move into 2024. Our interest rate forecast, we believe, is
consistent with most rate forecasts out there. Our planning assumption is that future Fed rate decreases begin in
May and then we see three more before the end of the year. Importantly, our yield curve shift is that it'll – that it
will be less inverted by year-end.
As for credit, we're again presenting our traditional credit metrics. Pinnacle's loan portfolio continued to perform
very well in the fourth quarter. Our belief is that credit should continue to perform well as we move into 2024.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Absent a couple of large charge-offs in 2023, 2023 was a good year as to losses realized from our portfolio. We
mentioned one non-performing credit in the press release last night, debated on whether to call it out or not – or
not – and for all of our NPAs is 27 basis points, which is very respectable in comparison to prior quarters. But
given the change from prior quarter, we decided to talk about that one credit. We feel that particular credit is well
down the road of being rehabilitated and expect no loss currently.
Similarly, there was an isolated incident in both classifieds and past dues. We downgraded a channel – a credit to
classified late in the fourth quarter and one credit also accounted substantially all the net change in past dues. For
that credit, the borrower did pay interest current before year-end, but we were past maturity and waiting on the
borrower to settle a few matters before granting the renewal, which we anticipate in the next week or so.
Concerning commercial real estate, again, some select information. As to the top left chart, construction
originations are very selective and reserved for projects where we have a strategic reason to participate. For
those that follow regulatory ratios, our 100% concentration ratio was at 84% at year-end, roughly the same as the
prior quarter. Our goal is to reduce that ratio [ph] approximately 70% (00:09:03) of the mix. Appetite for
construction lending will remain limited at this time.
Secondly, much discussion about renewals of commercial real estate fixed rate loans, which is the objective of
the chart on the top right. Over the next four quarters, we will have approximately $500 million in fixed rate
commercial real estate renewal coming up for repricing with the average rate on these loans is currently around
4.5%. Our current yield target for these loans, at renewal will be in the 7.5% to 8% range. Altogether, we have
about $6 billion of fixed rate loans maturing over the next two years with a weighted average yield of 4.8%. Thus,
we see real opportunity from a repricing perspective for these loans.
Now on to fees. And as always, I'll speak to BHG in a few minutes. Excluding BHG and various other [ph] non-
recurrings (00:09:54), fee revenues are up 1% to 2% linked-quarter. We are very pleased to report that our wealth
management units had a strong 2023 and we fully expect the efforts of our wealth management professionals will
continue into 2024. As we noted in last night's press release, we accomplished a significant BOLI restructuring
program during the quarter as we sought to increase yields on about $740 million in BOLI contracts with various
carriers.
In the end, we feel like the payback period on the approximately $16 million in charges we incurred during the
quarter is around a year and a half. We believe the anticipated tax equivalent cash yield on our entire BOLI
portfolio as a result of all this will approximate 4.5% in 2024 and 5.5% in 2025. This compares to approximately a
3.4% yield currently.
Now expenses. Fourth quarter expenses came in about where we thought. As we noted in the third quarter, we
expect special assessment from the FDIC in the fourth quarter. A $29 million FDIC special assessment was
recorded in the fourth quarter, which we will pay to the FDIC over eight quarters beginning in June of 2024.
Our incentive costs for the fourth quarter include the final calculations for our 2023 cash bonus awards. The total
costs for 2023 were slightly over $46 million. In comparison to our target payout, the plan would have required
about $30 million more in cost. So our 2023 earnings include $30 million of incentive savings, which is exactly
how the plan is supposed to work. If we hit targets, participants are eligible for target awards; if we don't, then we
aren't. I will speak more about our outlook for expenses in 2024 in a few minutes.
Capital. Our tangible book value per common share increased to $51.38 at quarter-end, up 14.8% year-over-year.
Our focus on book value generation has been a big positive for our firm and has, we believe, benefited our firm

meaningfully. Growing tangible book value has been top of mind to leadership over the last several years and has
impacted decisioning as management has not been willing to risk significant tangible book value dilution by
perhaps building a large investment portfolio. If we had, we could have put tangible book value generation at risk.
Impacting capital ratio in the fourth quarter were several matters that we discussed in the press release last night.
In addition to the BOLI restructuring and the FDIC special assessment, we incurred a $35 million capital charge
[indiscernible] (00:12:34) BHG's adoption of CECL on October 1, 2023, which was consistent with our
expectations for the last year or so. Again, this amount did not impact fourth quarter earnings, but did impact our
capital and our capital ratios.
The chart on the bottom left of the slide details several pro forma capital ratios at the end of [ph] this year
(00:12:55) and how we compare to peers on these ratios as of the end of September. Although we don't
anticipate significant changes to the capital rules, we're pleased with these results and believe they will continue
to compare favorably to other banks and speaks to our efforts to manage tangible book value effectively.
Now to BHG. As we look at fourth quarter originations and as we mentioned last quarter, fourth quarter origination
volumes were less than the third quarter as they continue to shrink their credit box, and I'd like to emphasize that
point. BHG estimates that 25% of their borrowers in 2021 and the first half of 2022 will not qualify for a BHG loan
today. We are very supportive of the efforts by our BHG partners with respect to credit discipline and client
selection.
We are also very pleased to see that sales into the bank network during the fourth quarter were basically
consistent with the third quarter. The banks continue to have a strong appetite for BHG credit with original
[indiscernible] (00:13:55) fourth quarter placements to institutional buyers were about $200 million less than the
third quarter. BHG did increase held-for-sale inventories on its balance sheet by $170 million in the fourth quarter,
which provides a nice runway going into 2024.
As to liquidity, not a lot of change here from last time. BHG's liquidity platform remains exceptionally strong.
During the fourth quarter and, again, as we mentioned at the end of the third quarter, BHG plays about $300
million in loans as a result of their second ABS transaction for 2023. BHG also successfully negotiated a $50
million private whole loan sale during the fourth quarter. Importantly, these private sale transactions are executed
with no recourse to BHG with many of these clients coming back to BHG routinely and planning on being back in
2024 as well.
As to spreads, this is the usual information we've shown in the past, detailing spread trends since the first quarter
of 2021. On the bottom chart, the spreads for all balance sheet loan placements have expanded as lower coupon
loans originated more than two to three years ago pay off so that borrower coupons for the on-balance sheet
continue to increase.
Again, as we've mentioned for several quarters, the spreads on the chart for on-balance sheet loans represents
the build-up of the book over the last few years. BHG believes that should the Fed begin to reduce rates in mid-
year 2024, such a move would likely result [ph] in more loan spreads (00:15:24) for BHG for both the bank and
institutional platforms.
Now to BHG credit, as we've noted in previous quarters, BHG has tightened its credit box over the last several
quarters, particularly with respect to lower tranches of its borrowing base. Average FICO for 2023 has improved to
745 from 732 in 2022. The chart on the right details originations in 2012 through 2015 [indiscernible] (00:15:54)

level out cumulative loss rates of 10% to 12%, whereas vintages after 2015 begin to reflect improved performance
with the lines leveling out within the 5% to 10% ranges.
On the reserves, again, the usual trends on loss reserves for both on- and off-balance sheet loans. As expected,
the adoption of CECL on October 1 for the on-balance sheet loans resulted in about 300 basis point increase in
reserves. Trailing 12-month losses for on-balance sheet amounted to 6.5% in the fourth quarter. If you just look at
the fourth quarter, losses were 7.6% for on-balance sheet loans. BHG has been anticipating that credit losses will
begin to trend down after the fourth quarter. Right now, BHG believe they have a great shot at seeing reduced
credit losses in the first quarter and with a much greater degree of confidence for reduced losses by the second
quarter of 2024.
Now, about BHG's earnings and production. Last quarter, we anticipated that fourth quarter loan production
[indiscernible] (00:16:55) approximate $600 million to $800 million, and it came in at the high end of that range,
impacting earnings and also, as we mentioned last time, BHG recorded several one- time expenses that
approximated $10 million in the third quarter. Impacting our fourth quarter results was approximately $4 million in
severance and other non-recurring costs.
A lot of work has been done by BHG to get ready for 2024. With a tighter credit box, BHG anticipates flattish
production comparing 2024 to 2023. That said, the bank network and institutional platform both remain very liquid
for BHG. Also, as the post-COVID credit issues fade into the background, along with a potentially better yield
curve, all of this could add up to make 2024 a much more accommodating year for BHG than 2023.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
All right. Thank you, Harold. Well, as Harold mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we hired our
leadership team for our market extension into Jacksonville, Florida. Earlier when I was discussing the 2023
performance, I highlighted the fact that we continue to invest in our business even during the difficult times, which
in my judgment has been the key to the extraordinary total shareholder return we continue to produce.
One of the good things about 2023 was that it showcased our enterprise-wide risk management system, which
provided the necessary guardrails to protect us when the numbers stumbled, but more importantly, put us in a
position to stay in the course, while many are trying to restructure their business model with major expense
initiatives, which may gain short-term earnings but have a devastating impact on long-term shareholder value
creation.
Our conservative approach to credit, to liquidity and interest rates, put us in a great position as we continue
investing in our business. The risk management system not only protected us, but again, left us a capital base
and an ability to continue to grow, which is what we intend to do.
Most of you know that our target market has been all the large urban markets in the Southeast, which are some
advantage, where Florida has been our principal [ph] void (00:19:14). Most of you have heard me talk about this
for a long time. The catalyst for when we decide to expand to a new market is when we have the availability of
leadership that we believe can build a $3 billion bank over a five-year period of time in any of those large markets.
Last quarter, I used this slide to build on the fact that having started on with a number bases back in 2000 in
Nashville, we now dominate the Nashville market by almost any measure, including things like FDIC deposit

share. And we're actually running faster in the relatively recent startups in Atlanta and Washington DC than we
did as we built out the Atlanta market.
As you can see here, Jacksonville, Florida is on par with our other large high growth markets; extraordinarily
healthy and rapidly growing. And it's ideally suited to us from the perspective of the competitive landscape. It's
dominated by the same exact competitors that we've been facing out with for now 23 years. I always try to help
people understand this. The size and growth dynamics are really important in terms of the success in the markets
that we've been in. But more important than the size and growth dynamics would be the competitive landscape.
It's important to have competitors from whom you can take market share.
As I've already said, talent availability is what controls the time. And as you can see, our leadership team in
Jacksonville is uniquely prepared to build a big bank there. Scott Keith, who'll run that market for us, is a 34-year
veteran in that market. He was the former regional president for North Florida at Truist, and he led an 1,100
employee group, serving 100,000 clients in that market. He's joined by Debbie Buckland, who has 27 years of
local experience and was the former market president in Jacksonville at Truist and prior to that, SunTrust. And
they are also joined by Bryan Taylor, who has 21 years' experience in the BB&T Truist franchise as well. He most
recently led North Florida, the middle market effort and through all of North Florida. So I think it's evident why
Jacksonville and why now.
So with that, I think I'll turn it over to Harold and we'll walk you through the 2024 outlook.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Quickly, we'll go through the 2024 financial outlook. What I'd like to do is condense all the
information on the slide down to five key points. First is deposits. We have to maintain consistent, reliable growth
in our deposit book at a reasonable price. That's what makes all the initiatives that we've invested in, together,
new deposit is so critical. I believe we've made great headway. I think we have got great tools in place. I think
we've hired experienced professionals to promote and lead these deposit-gathering initiatives. So, high single to
low double-digit growth seems reasonable.
Secondly, BHG. We don't anticipate BHG to have a great year. We do expect modest growth, [ph] mid-single digit
(00:22:54). So I think that comes basically from a new firm, one that has the ability to achieve sustainable growth
with an intense focus on growing core businesses. We've had a great partnership with BHG and we believe that
the partnership is as strong as ever. We believe the leadership at BHG is focused on the franchise and not on
pushing more widgets through the pipe. The credit can get back to its usual run rate by the second half of this
year. BHG could have a great year.
Loans and loan pricing, primarily fixed rate loan pricing, we've done well to get fixed rate loan pricing to their
current levels. In comparison to peers, we do quite well, but we can be better. We will continue to focus on that,
as I think that will be absolutely critical to our ability to grow net interest income, high single to low double-digits in
2024.
Now I'd like to talk about expenses. It seems like our expense growth rates are always a topic of great discussion.
In 2023, we harvested at least $30 million out of our incentive plan to help support our EPS results for 2023. In
order to support our people in 2024, we need to have a plan that accommodates upwards of $40 million to $50
million in additional incentive expense. As always, we absolutely have to hit numbers. If we don't hit numbers, we
won't pay.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
We've averaged about 80% of targeted payout in my 23 years here at Pinnacle. We are not bashful about using
the incentive pool to help support our earnings results. I do think a reasonable expense target at this point for
2024, probably would lie between $960 million and $985 million. So as you're putting together your models, that
range seems fair for today.
Lastly earnings, this management group understands to get the share price moving up, you've got to grow core
EPS. We believe 2023 was a $6 [indiscernible] (00:24:55) year, so we're aiming north of that. We've looked at
peers and have stacked ranked earnings growth rate projections for 2024. Our plan will be comfortably in the top
quartile of earnings growth. We have to grow earnings in 2024, so our targets reflect that.
To be successful, we can't let expense growth outpace revenues. It's that simple. Hopefully, we can achieve our
planning assumptions such that all of our associates earn their incentive while in time the share price reflects all
the hard work that they've accomplished.
And with that, Matt, I'll turn it back over to you for Q&A.

Curious, did we just kind of touch base on the expenses, Harold? A good clarity [indiscernible] (00:26:05). So
when you think about just expenses overall, is this entirely going to or a majority going to lenders or is there some
technology or back office spending that needs to be done? I mean, it just seems like Pinnacle is getting back to
legacy Pinnacle of kind of low double-digit growth is good, but it could put some pressure on PPNR over 2024 or
just – just kind of clarity on where that expense might be going.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Yeah, Ben, I'll start and I'll let Terry kind of add his comments as well on this whole topic. Kind of our non-
personnel expense base for next year is fairly reasonable. I think, last night, we talked about in the press release
that our – if you exclude incentives growth rates probably in the low double-digit range, I think that's pretty
conservative. With a, call it, an 8.60% to 8.85% kind of target for this year, I think we're more of a high single-digit
kind of grower with respect to excluding incentives.
Our IT team has gone through what they believe they're going to need to do this year. We spent a lot of extra time
on operational expenses and information technology expenses for 2024. We think we've got a good plan and we
think we've got a plan that they can accomplish and at the same time not overboard on kind of the expense
burden. With that, I'll stop and let Terry kind of finish.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Ben, I think to your point, we've continued to invest. I think it would be foolhardy not to invest in technology.
I mean, you've got all the digital progression, AI, all those sorts of things. So we're not a do-nothing company. We
continue to invest in technology and stay current. I think you know about our firm. We're not trying to innovate
anything. We're not trying to do something particularly new and different. Our idea is to be a fast follower, and so
to do that, we have to stay current. So certainly there are expenditures other than incentive type expenditures.
But one of the things that, I guess, I would offer for clarity in this company, your question was phrased around is it
all going to lenders? So in this company, 100% of our salaried employees just buy an annual cash incentive plan
and 100% of us yet earn our incentive based on hitting our revenue growth targets, our earnings growth targets
and keeping asset quality strong. So, 3,400 people are aimed at that outcome and that – that's who gets paid.
And so having only paid at a 62% level this year, you wouldn't expect most of our associates desire to make
100%. Therefore, we have to run fast enough to produce enough revenue and earnings growth to satisfy the
shareholder returns but get ourselves [indiscernible] (00:29:12), I think we can do that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Sure. No, that's good color. I think it's philosophically hitting commission targets and bonus payouts is a good
thing because it literally means you hit your upside targets. But then if you could kind of just parse through here a
little bit. So when you think about adding additional lenders and just running – more lenders specifically than just
revenue producers, how are they incentivized or how much flexibility do you give them on gathering deposits in
this environment?
I mean, given you're pretty rapid at pace of growth, are you giving them a little bit more slack to gather deposits?
I'm sure that's on the scorecard as well. And kind of tangentially to that, does that kind of put a lid on the margin
overall? I get the back book repricing will produce a higher margin by the end of the year. I'm just kind of curious
on how you guys are structuring their incentive on gathering deposits and any flexibility on the rate they might
have?

M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Ben, let me just reinforce the point I made earlier. Most people have a hard time understanding that
incentive systems here at Pinnacle, most people are used to structured plans where relationship managers get
paid on one basis. And, branch managers might be paid on a different basis and, so forth. That's not what
happens here. 100% of our salary-based associates, which would include lenders, financial advisors, office

leaders, every category of salaried person, their incentive is tied to this company getting its revenue and its
earnings targets. And so that's a really important thing that I think a lot of people don't get that direct connection.
And so when you ask about the incentives for the lenders, if you will, to gather deposits and so forth, they have an
incentive which is we're going to have to hit the revenue and earnings growth targets. And to get that done, we've
got to produce the loan volumes. To get that done, we have to produce satisfactory deposit volumes. And so
that's the mindset inside this company. 3,400 people are aimed at hitting that revenue target for the company and
the earnings target for the company. It's not an individual – individually based incentive plan.
I don't mind to say to you. I don't want to go too far afield from what you're asking. But, that idea is really
important. Every quarter, we meet with all the associates of the firm and we don't film about, hey, here's where we
are on our performance on revenue and where we are on earnings and how that impacts incentive. And these are
the things we need to do. But it is really easy to crystallize for every single person.
As an example, if we're not hitting, if we're not repricing fixed rate loans at a satisfactory margin, man, every
quarter, you can stand and hear, it's okay, look, here's what the target is. Here's what we did. Here's what that
cost us in terms of revenue and earnings. And, man, everybody can see through clearly to exactly what has
happened and what needs to happen in order to hit the target. So I don't need to go on too much about it. I hope
that's helpful.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yeah, it is. I was just more so curious, like how much flexibility are you giving them on rate in order to gather
those deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
The – our – again, well, we're getting way down into the philosophy here. But as you know, we hire experienced
people. The average experience of people that we've hired is 26 years. Fundamentally, what we do is try to make
sure they know what our targets are and then give them plenty of freedom to execute. Generally, the relationship
manager has the flexibility to decide what the price is for the deposits and what the price is for the loans. What
happens is, in fact, because it is out there, they know we have to hit the targets. They're not inclined to overpay
on deposits or get underpaid on loans and so forth.
And of course, we have a tight management system where every month, we're going down through everybody's
performance with key performance indicators, talking about, hey, what's the reason for this? Why are you doing
this? This price needs to come down, all those kinds of things. So it takes an active management, but generally,
we're handling that in arrears and empowering our client-facing people to be able to handle client needs without a
lot of bureaucracy.

Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Wanted to start with BHG and just try and understand a little better the confidence on the reduced losses by 2Q.
Can you just walk us through your thought process on BHG and – obviously the guidance is for fairly minimal
growth and contribution this year, but it sounds like you're thinking it could be a lot better if certain things play out
right with credit and perhaps growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, that's a great question. For us, it's – we have conversations with BHG quite frequently and they still believe
that the first half of 2022 and the 2021 loans, we're aware these outsized losses are originating. At large, they will
see substantially all their losses within, call it, the first 30 months of origination.
And given the great inflation, a lot of those loans have come to kind of the knowledge that they're not – there
won't be good loans fairly quickly. So they believe that where they are today at the – call it, the end of 2023, that a
lot of the 2021 credits have already gone through this proverbial pig through the python. And so they're still
looking at some of the 2022 credits and are watching those. But they believe that they're substantially through the
bulk of the problems.

M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Brett, I was just going to say, I think, to say it safely, they're watching their migration analysis. And to Harold's
point, the largest part of the losses occur in the first 30 months. So when you look at those migrations, they really
have just a few more months to go before they will have completed that 30-month cycle for that period where the
great inflation occurred. And so, again, I think Harold tried to isolate out the ongoing FICO scores and so forth for
more recently originated credits. And so it's just a matter, as he said, of getting that pig through the python, which
is literally just several months away.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay, that's helpful. And then just around BHG conceptually, the IPO market for fintech was fairly minimal last
year and this year it could be better. Is there a potential for you guys to maybe sell a portion of BHG's ownership
to potentially increase capital ratios? Or how do you think about BHG ownership from here? And are they
obviously at one point where it would appear to have been thinking about an IPO? Maybe just walk through your
ownership of them from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Brett, I think I would say this. It's really just a reinforcement, I think, [ph] off of (00:37:13) what I've said for
some time. So we still enjoy a fabulous partnership with BHG. I continue to love that business as I've tried to say,
if I own 100% of Pinnacle, I want to own 100% of BHG and we would focus on gain-on-sale transactions, but it
doesn't work that way. And so I think we've come to the conclusion that the volatility and the difficulty in getting
bank investors to understand the model, at some point it's just not worth continuing the battle.
And so we have decided whenever the time's right that we would like to reduce our ownership interest at BHG in
whole or in part, not to be trite, but I'm more of a buy-low-sell-high guy. And so it's not an ideal time to liquidate
our position. We're comfortable with it. It provides a great source of income to us. And so we'll continue in the
current arrangement. But whenever the markets get to a point where you could enjoy a higher price, we would be
willing to sell some or all of our position in BHG.

rate cuts, it seems like there maybe isn't that much NIM upside. I'm just wondering kind of what your expectation
is for NIM cadence throughout the year given the broader NII guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Timur, I thought what's in our plan for this year is that we will see continued increases in our fixed rate
lending. So that'll provide somewhat of a tailwind here in 2024 for, call it, earning asset yields. I think we will have
to be very aggressive if there is a rate cut. Now, keep in mind that basically 27% of my deposit book is indexed.
So I do have that head start, probably more so than maybe some others. But our relationship managers will have
to maintain constant contact [indiscernible] (00:39:55) with their depositors over the course of 2024, so that we
can respond very quickly with respect to rate cuts.
I appreciate that other banks can go into their systems and punch a button and lower deposit rates. We can do
that, too, for some portion of our deposit book. But what it's going to do for us, or what we're going to have to do is
be in touch with our clients in a way that we've probably not been in play because we're going to be taking money
away from them basically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And then just looking at the 2024 commercial real estate maturities, can you talk through what years
those loans were originated? And I'm just wondering, for the 2019 and prior vintages, just how different are those
credits, given just how different the world is today compared to pre-pandemic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I think most of our commercial real estate loans are probably on a three- to five-year kind of term. Most of
the both owner occupied and non-owner occupied loans are on a fixed rate. So I think by and large, most are
ready for rent increases. I think the last number I saw was that they've seen some 20% to 30% increase in rentals
over the last three to four years. But we feel like they've got the cash flow to support the increased interest rates.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
I'm going to start guys with following up on that. So when I look at slide 12, you guys are pretty excited about
these renewal rates coming in much higher on your commercial real estate portfolio. But that same phenomenon
is keeping many investors out of the banks, particularly the regional banks. And all of the regionals are even
painted with the same brush no matter where your markets are. So I have two questions. One is for the
commercial real estate loans that were reset in the fourth quarter, excluding office. I know you have a large office
portfolio. Could you just share with the investor community what's happening with these loans?
There's this pretend and extend mentality that you guys are just extending these and they're not renewed. Can
you share with us what's happening? How much of the value has changed? Are you able to just renew these
without any impact on credit? And as you look at 1Q 2024, 2Q 2024, 3Q, the ability to turn those including office
without seeing a material negative impact on credit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Steve, I will start.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Harold, do you want take a first crack at that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I'll start and let Terry clean me up here. I'm not hearing from the credit officers they're having any kind of
particularly onerous time with respect to getting renewals accomplished or having to sacrifice concessions or
whatever to get these – to get these new loans booked. I think what we do enjoy and you mentioned you kind of –
you kind of mentioned it, is that we are in great markets and we're seeing, rent increases. We're not seeing any
kind of reductions in occupancy rates. We think our commercial real estate book, by and large, is probably one of
the best performing segments of our portfolio. So we're pleased with where it is.
And a lot of these developers, builders, borrowers have been with Pinnacle now for a long time or with – or with
their relationship managers for a long time. So we feel pretty strongly that our client selection processes have
been strong and have been good. And so we don't feel necessarily the need to be – to be overly concerned. That
said, our credit officers are looking under rocks for everything they can to be prepared should something come up
that we didn't expect. And they're having conversations with clients accordingly. Terry, how about you? Build from
there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think I would add two or three things as it relates to commercial real estate in the whole and particularly as
it relates to the office portfolio. I think one thing, Steve, that amazes people, if you go through our 40 largest loans
that are being held by special assets people, people that work difficult credits, I think there are two loans in that
top 40 that would be CRE-related. And so again, I'd just say that, you know the phrase, the platform is done. It's
your future performance. But it certainly is a strong indicator to me that that portfolio has held up so well so far.
I think one of the reasons that it has is two things. One, as we underwrote those loans when they went on the
books to begin with in the construction phase and so forth, we always underwrite with a mortgage cost that – that
projects a future cost and on what the permanent would take you out at. And I would say, most of the loans on the
15

Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
books would have been underwritten, assuming a mortgage cost within the 6.5% or 7% range. So granted that
might be a tick below the renewal rates, but it's not substantially below the renewal rates, it was underwritten to
perform at that level.
I think the other thing – this might be the most important aspect. I like you. I mean, I've got CNBC on and I watch
these disaster stories from markets like San Francisco or, up east and so forth. But, in these Southeastern
markets, we use the map. We talked about the growth going on in those markets, but the rent growth over the last
three or four years has really been extraordinary. And so that rent growth, obviously, is what enables those
borrowers to absorb the elevated fixed rates and puts us in a good position.
I think, on the idea of the extend and portend, every now and then we do – as we renew, we have people that
have to rightsize a credit, but if they have to rightsize it, they have to rightsize it. I mean, we're not just rolling and
hoping for the best. They need to do whatever it takes to rightsize that credit. So anyway, as I say, I don't want to
overemphasize past performance, but it is a comforting thing to me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah, that's helpful color. I want to pivot to the margin. So, Harold, I think you said you're assuming four cuts in
the guidance, is that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So if I look at your margin before the pandemic, right, you guys are pretty routinely at a 3.5% to 3.8%
range, which is way above where you are now. If we think about – even four rate cuts or five rate cuts, we'll see
what the number looks like. But the yield curve is starting to steepen. From a structural view, is there any reason
your margin with the more normal curve at this level of rates, which is normal, won't go back eventually into that
range? I know it'll take time. But as these renewals play out, you cut deposit costs. Is there any reason to think
over time we're not somewhere back in that range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think that's a great question and we debate that quite a bit as to what we think our long-term net interest margin
is, and we believe it's somewhere in the 3.40% to 3.60% range. And we get there by, based on what our current
spreads on – on our floating rate credits. And then, what we think our depositors will – will need to pay in relation
to Fed funds.
So we think we're at 3.40% to 3.60%. I'm not hinting at that we'll get to that this year. But at the same time, we do
believe our margin is in great shape right now. We think our balance sheet is in good shape. We think we can –
we can definitely take advantage of what the market will present to us this year, provided we can see some, call it,
less steepening in the yield curve.

Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on BHG. In the press release, you
mentioned that they exited some businesses. Can you just discuss what those are and what the – kind of the

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, they had that buy-now-pay-later franchise that they were developing. I think last year, they originated like
$50 million in production, something like that. So that – they were winging all off that. They've always
experimented with this patient lending franchise. I think they've decided to abandon that as well. There's a couple
of others that are also on the list that I'm aware of. I'm not sure where they are with discussions with the people
that work in those units, but I think they've had discussions with them. I'm just not sure, Michael, but that is
embedded in the production guidance they have for this year.

expectations for rate cuts. Just – just wanted to kind of put a finer point on just that progression or earning asset
growth, if you could. Thanks.

Harold R. Carpenter A

Okay. Okay. And – and then on the mix side of things, how are you thinking about how the mix shift will trend this
year and how does that kind of flow into your assumptions on deposit costs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, that's a great question. As far as the mix shift out of DDA into higher-yielding deposit products, we still plan
to see some more of that. But again, not like we saw earlier in 2023, but we do believe there will be some more
attrition out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing products, but again, not at the same pace.

Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just wanted to go back and revisit the 2024 outlook and what this implies
for the year-over-year PPNR growth. It feels like you're – you're trying to say that there will be modest year-over-
year PPNR growth even with the higher expense guidance. But just looking for any clarification around that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think our planning assumption is that we will. I think it will be – if you look at what the peers are looking at
for next year, it's a modest, at-best, kind of year for 2024, but we fully intend to outperform the peer group. They
probably won't be consistent with, call it, a year prior. But at the same time, we fully expect to see PPNR and net
earnings accretion in 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Appreciate the clarification. And then just a follow-up on BHG. I guess I appreciate the – I think the
guidance you give us there. It sounds like cost cutting will be a driver of the – of the positive, modest, positive fee
growth there. Any more color on the moving parts? How much – how much do you expect the BHG revenues to
decline year-over-year? And then for you to hit that kind of guidance you put out there, how much do we need to
see expenses decline? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, they've had a pretty significant decrease in the fourth quarter from the third quarter. I don't think they'll have
that much more here in the next year. But they – they will see, call it, some reduction in 2024 expenses in
comparison to 2023. They have a cost cutting exercise in the fourth quarter. That'll be the primary contributor to
that. I think their revenues should shape up to be flattish maybe next year. I think they're optimistic with respect to
growth there. But the whole idea is to rightsize the franchise and get it more focused on their core products and
then get into, call it, a sustainable growth rate going into 2025.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Yeah, thanks. I guess my first question is just around the Jacksonville expansion. I may have missed it, but is the
belief that this can be $1 billion to $2 billion in asset bank and then with the – you also have Louisville noted on
the map, and I'm wondering if that's just the construct of the map or if that's intentional?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Two things, Stephen. I think in the case of Louisville, we have started de novo operation there, I guess, Harold,
help me, three or four quarters ago or something like that. So it's an early stage build-out using the same model
that we have, market leadership with a long career at Wells Fargo, that's leading our effort there.
In the case of Jacksonville, yes, we do believe – I think you use the number $1 billion to $2 billion. Generally, our
target is a $3 billion bank in a five-year period of time. As you may know, generally for these build-outs, the – we
cross breakeven anywhere from four to seven quarters, dependent upon how steep or what the trajectory is there.
But we're expecting a pretty rapid build-out in Jacksonville that would likely resemble what we've done in DC.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. And then just my follow-up is around net charge-off expectations. I think it was 16 basis points this
year and you said 2024 should be consistent with that. What's kind of embedded within those expectations in
terms of overall economic scenario? I mean, are we thinking about a soft landing? And if things get worse overall
that could be – could be worse as well? Or is that just a function of you-all's book itself and the strength of your
internal book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yes, Stephen. I don't know...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A

No, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think I'll say yes to all of that. I think, before we really started to have some conversations with the special asset
people, we have conversations with the credit officers. They feel pretty good about where the book sits today.
They feel pretty good about what borrowers are doing and how they're cooperating with us. For those that might
be under some – some kind of special considerations. So we don't – we don't sense that, nor do we sense that, I
mean, it's presenting huge challenges for the portfolio at large.

So we think that was really healthy here this time going into 2024. And we believe also that many of the
uncertainties that were around this time last year are not nearly as uncertain. Appreciate that we could have a
recession. It could be a soft landing. And I believe our assertion as to where we think charge-offs will be in 2024 is
under kind of a soft landing, no recession kind of scenario. Who knows what happens if we get into a hard
landing, but anyway, I would say yes to all the items that you talked about, Stephen.

M. Terry Turner A

Stephen, I don't know about this narrative, but yeah, I think our assumption is that we are most likely to have a
soft landing, perhaps a modest recession and given the health and strength and current performance of the
portfolio, that guidance ought to hold up, I think to Harold's point, do you have a great recession? I don't think you
ought to assume we're going to have 16 basis points in net charge-offs.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
A follow-up on BHG and just thinking about how to model the revenue for BHG next year. If we look back at the
size of the balance sheet and the loans that stayed on-balance sheet for BHG, that grew a lot throughout 2020
and 2022 as they are kind of shifting from the gain on sale strategy to more on-balance sheet. And of course that
goal this year in the balance sheet was basically flat in 2023, just given the rate environment. How do you think
about how that looks as we move through 2024, just as we kind of think about how much of originations stay on-
balance sheet versus how much go out into the bank network or move off-balance sheet in the private sale
transaction?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think what's going to happen this year is, I believe based on conversations I've had with their CFO, you
should see more headed into the bank network this year than last year. I think it was fairly close to a even split in

2023. I think they'll try to lean into the bank network a little more this year than last. I think they still are planning
one or two ABS issuances here in 2024. They were able to get one accomplished in the fourth quarter, which we
think was great news for them. But, yeah, I think they will use the bank network with a little more intensity in 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, great. And then on just the big picture, kind of 2024 outlook and just thinking about EPS growth and I know
you've kind of answered this in potentially different ways, but I mean your target for – maybe question one is, what
is the incentive comp in 2024 versus 2023? I think it started out the year 125% last year. So curious what that
looks like for this year, assuming a full payout.
And then maybe within that, I'm assuming that even with a full payout, that is assuming you're going to grow EPS
year-over-year kind of off of a, let's call it, a $7 number in 2023. And so, again, just want to reiterate, there isn't a
scenario where you're going to have this kind of mid-double-digit expense growth pace and have decline in EPS
or have mid-single-digit revenue growth. And just want to kind of clarify how you're thinking about how those two
pair together and ultimately what you think is an appropriate EPS growth rate to have in 2024 to get a full
incentive comp pay?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. As we put together kind of our earnings number and [ph] we have had (01:04:04) to do this in the past, but I
think it's probably beneficial to do that. We're talking low- to mid-single-digit kind of earnings growth for this year.
And so with that, what we have to do is build a plan that will get our associates their incentive. We're starting at,
call it, 120% of target and then we'll tier it upwards to where we think our earnings number needs to be for the
year. And it'll go all the way down to zero as far as payout.
Last year, you're right, we started at 125%, we ended at 62%. So basically from what our associates were looking
at, at the beginning of last year to [indiscernible] (01:04:54), we cut it basically in half. For 2024, we're starting with
like a, call it, 120% payout and that number is somewhere in the $100 million range, if we can afford it. But you're
right, the earnings have to show up. And if they don't show up, that $100 million begins to get less fairly quickly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hi, Catherine. I might jump in and add to Harold's comments. And I know you know this, but I get questions over
time, which make me believe some people don't understand this. But that earnings target that gets set there,
we've never said it to be less than the top quartile. As you know this year, top quartile is not all that high. But
again, we are projecting earnings growth here. It will be top quartile. And that earnings growth that we're
projecting contemplates the full payout of the annual cash incentive plan. And in the event that the revenues don't
materialize to produce the earnings at the targeted level, the way you pay for that is you frame the incentive
expense.
And so again, I think I know there are a lot of companies that have all kinds of incentive plans, where if they make
some, then they pay out all this other stuff. But that's not the way it works for us. The incentive is built into the
earnings projection. When the earnings show up, we pay it out. In the event they don't, we retrieve that or harvest
that to fuel earnings to the shareholder. So I don't know if that's a helpful explanation or not, but...

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
No, it is, and it's certainly what we saw this past year. And it's just tough in a year where rest of, to your point,
peers in general were forecasting a decline in EPS year-over-year. And so, top quartile may look really good, but
if – or you may be to have top quartile, but you still may be kind of flat EPS growth. So I was just trying to kind of
think about how you're thinking about EPS growth and marry that with the full payout to make sure we're thinking
about an EPS target appropriately.

Hi, Brody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Harold, I'm sorry to beat a dead horse on expenses. I just wanted to put a pretty fine point on it. So, excluding the
FDIC surcharge, you're at $858.8 million of expenses for the year. If I look at the guidance slide, I take kind of
mid- to high-teens to imply 14% to 19% kind of range. So the midpoint of that would imply $1 billion number off of
your $858.8 million versus the $960 million to $985 million you gave, which is about $972.5 million. So it's about a
3% difference there. And I was just wondering, what's driving the delta between what you said on the call versus
what's implied in the deck last night?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
So we call that mid to high. I think the delta is around 120% payout versus 100% payout. And some other things
that I'm aware of in our plan where I think we have some cushions. So that's what got me to the $960 million to
$985 million number I talked about earlier.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. That's very helpful color. I appreciate it. And then I did just want to ask on NII; a couple of questions and
one here, Harold. You said May, I think, for the first cut. First part of the question is, could you clarify within your –
within your NII guidance when the other three cuts you have occurring are?
And then secondly, just when I look at the loan growth guidance and – and compare it on an average basis, it
implies about, 11-plus percent average loan growth. And so I guess I'm wondering is there the opportunity where,
you guys can kind of outperform even the high-end of the guidance range that you've given? Just given the, low
double-digit average loan growth you're expecting, combined with pretty significant fixed rate repricing throughout
the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think on, first of all, on the rate cuts and don't hold me to this, but I had that question for some people here
yesterday. I think it was – I think we've got embedded July, September and November, maybe. Don't hold me to
that. I think those are kind of splitting the dot plot, but anyway, I'll go with that. It's just a steady decrease. I think
along with that, you should assume a higher beta on our deposit cost. We had a high beta going up; we think we'll
have a higher beta going down. So we will try to recoup as much of those rate decreases as we can from our
deposit book or just try to get as close to 100% as we can.
As far as loan growth and I'll let Terry also talk to this as well, I think the guardrails we have on loans are related
to capital and related to the client deposit growth. We can't let the loans just outgrow deposits extended. In the
fourth quarter, we were like $700 million to $200 million, something like that. We need to push deposit growth up.
At the same time, we've been steadily accreting capital over the last year or two. We think that's healthy. We think
that we will continue to do that, but we can absolutely beat the loan growth target that we – in the – in the – on
outlook slide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Could I add just one quick follow-up? I just wanted to follow-up on Brandon's question that he had on the
spot rate, on the interest-bearing deposits being below the average for the quarter. So if we don't see any – I
know you said to expect further creep, but I'm just trying to think mathematically, if you guys aren't raising rates at
this point, what drives the average up if the spot rate is below, where it was for the fourth quarter?

Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah I think the – what could contribute to increased deposit rates are just new accounts, new clients trying to
move money across the street from somebody else. I think that would be one of the primary contributors.
Additionally, mix shift could occur primarily around our public fund deposits. We think the – we believe the bulk of
our public fund depositors have already built their balances up, but we could see some increase in their balances.
Most of those accounts are indexed. And so consequently, as they collect property taxes and whatnot, that money
finds its way to our bank.

Jacksonville, how are you thinking about hiring in 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think that – I think, we had a little bit of a reduction in the hiring pace in 2023 from 2022. I think we're likely
to migrate back somewhere closer to the 2022 level of hiring. And to your point, Jacksonville will be a big
contributor to that hiring.

M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I would say that, with a numerator topped about four in the past. We introduced three more toward the tail of
2023. And my expectation is we'll probably introduce two or three more over the course of 2024. I think the three
additional specialties, probably the one that holds the most opportunity for us, is focused on all manner of escrow
accounts, whether it be 1031 exchanges, mortgage escrows, attorney firms, all those kinds of things.
But we believe that we have an advantage software capability for people that are running as agent on escrow
money. We think we've got some advantage software that's helpful there. And look for that to be the biggest of
these most recent three product specialties that we've introduced. And so I think what's important about it, Brian,
is two things. One, the size of the market is huge. We have an advantage product, which had let us penetrate it
well. But the second thing that's really important is most of that money is either no cost or low cost money. And so
that's a powerful specialty that we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And just the last one for me, guys, was just held back on the margin. It sounds like
first quarter is, flattish or, stable and then up from there, the biggest drivers of that, cadence of increase
throughout the year, is it – is it outside of the fixed rate repricing? Is there something else in there? I guess that's
the key driver, is that it? I know you have liquidity drop a little bit this quarter. So just trying to understand the – the
benefits there going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, we do have some [indiscernible] (01:15:55) liquidity shrinkage over the course of the year. That will be a
contributor to the margin primarily, not necessarily net interest income. But we do intend to be very aggressive on
reducing our deposit cost.

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A

I think we determined that based on what happened during the COVID crisis last year that – that – and our ability
– and the fact that we raised rates so aggressively that we've got the ability to lower and I believe a lot of the large
caps we are talking about that they're still trying to catch up on deposit rates. Well, we think we're pretty much
already there. So...
