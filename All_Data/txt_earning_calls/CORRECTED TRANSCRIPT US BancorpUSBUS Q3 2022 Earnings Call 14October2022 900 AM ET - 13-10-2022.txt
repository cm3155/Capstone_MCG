Q3 2022 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2022
Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks,
Terry and I will take any questions you have.
And I'll begin on slide 3. In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.16, which included $0.02 per
share of merger and integration charges related to the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank. Excluding these
notable items, we reported earnings per share of $1.18 for the quarter. During the third quarter, we achieved
record net revenue totaling $6.3 billion.
Third quarter results were highlighted by strong revenue growth, well-controlled expenses and stable credit
quality. This quarter, we added $200 million to our loan loss reserve, reflecting loan growth and our consistent
through-the-cycle underwriting approach to risk management. At September 30, our CET1 capital ratio was 9.7%.
Our tangible book value per share totaled $20.73 at September 30 or 3.2% lower than the prior quarter, driven by
the impact of rising interest rates on our available-for-sale securities.
slide 4 provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, we delivered a return on average assets of
1.24% and a return on average common equity of 16.2%. Our return on tangible common equity was 21.4% on a
core basis.
slide 5 highlights continued positive trends in digital engagement as consumer and business customers gain a
deeper understanding of our digital capabilities and benefit from our digital-plus-human approach.
slide 6 slows progress across our digital and payments initiatives that are both deepening our core competencies
and expanding our competitive advantage, which we believe will drive meaningful profit and return differentiation
to our company. One example of our digital initiatives is our launch of talech Register, a next-generation all-in-one
payments and business analytics platform that is helping to bring greater simplicity, convenience and efficiencies
to the point of sale for our business banking customers.
On the right side of the slide, you can see the continuing momentum we are gaining in real-time payments
transactions. Year-to-date through September 30, the total number of transactions are 17 times higher than the
full year 2020.
Recently we introduced an innovative real-time payment solution to auto dealers, where we provide loan funds
instantly after a loan contract is finalized. This gives our participating dealer clients greater control of their cash
flow and helps to improve their day-to-day operational efficiency.
Turning to slide 7. Our business banking initiative continues to gain traction with steady progress both in growing
accounts and expanding wallet share. Growth in relationships with both banking and payments products has
continued to meaningfully outpace growth in total relationships over the past 12 months.
Looking ahead, we expect recently launched and innovative offerings in development to help further deepen our
existing relationships between business banking and payments customers.
Now let me turn the call over to Terry, who'll provide more detail on the quarter.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2022
Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Andy. If you turn to slide 8, I'll start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of third quarter
earnings trends. Average loans increased 3.9% compared with the second quarter, driven by 6.5% growth in
commercial loans, 4.7% growth in mortgage loans and 6.0% growth in credit card balances.
Commercial loan growth reflected increased business activity and higher utilization rates across both large
corporate and middle-market portfolios. Underlying demand remains healthy as we continue to focus on
appropriate return opportunities to prudently deploy our capital.
In the retail portfolio, we saw solid linked-quarter growth and year-over-year growth in credit card balances,
reflecting strong spending activity and lower payment rates. Purchased mortgage market share gains and lower
prepayment activity continued to support residential mortgage balance growth.
Turning to slide 9. Total average deposits increased slightly compared to the second quarter. Growth in total
interest-bearing deposits more than offset the impact of lower total non-interest-bearing deposit balances as
customers respond to the rising interest rate environment. Total average deposits increased by 5.9% compared to
a year ago.
Slide 10 shows credit quality trends, which continue to be strong across our loan portfolio. The ratio of non-
performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.20% at September 30 compared with 0.23% at June 30
and 0.32% a year ago.
Our third quarter charge-off ratio of 0.19% improved slightly versus the second quarter of 2022 and third quarter
of 2021 levels. The allowance for credit losses as of September 30 totaled $6.5 billion or 1.88% of period-end
loans. The $200 million increase in our reserve this quarter was primarily reflective of loan growth and, to a lesser
extent, uncertainties in the economic outlook.
Slide 11 provides an earnings summary. In the third quarter, we reported $1.18 per share excluding $0.02 per
share of merger and integration charges related to the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank.
Turning to slide 12. Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis totaled $3.9 billion, representing an
11.3% increase compared with the second quarter and a 20.6% increase from a year ago. Linked quarter growth
was driven by strong earning asset growth and a 24 basis point increase in the net interest margin, which
benefited from rising interest rates, partially offset by deposit pricing and short-term borrowing costs.
Slide 13 highlights trends in non-interest income. Non-interest income decreased 3.1% on a linked quarter basis
as declines in mortgage banking and treasury management revenues were partially offset by stronger corporate
payments revenue and an increase in other non-interest revenue.
Compared with a year ago, non-interest income declined 8.3% primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue,
reduced deposit service charges reflecting changes in our policies and lower treasury management fees due to
rising rates, partially offset by higher payments revenue and trust and investment management fees.
The decline in mortgage revenue primarily reflected lower refinancing activity in the market, which continued to
pressure total application volumes and the related gain-on-sale margins given excess industry capacity. In the
third quarter, total payments revenue increased by 4.9% compared with the year earlier.

Slide 14 provides linked quarter and year-over-year revenue growth trends for our three payments businesses.
Because of the cyclical nature of our payments businesses, we believe year-over-year trends are a better
indicator of underlying business performance in a normal environment.
Credit and debit card fee revenue decreased 0.5% on a year-over-year basis as the impact of higher credit card
and debit card volume was more than offset by continued lower prepaid card activity. Excluding prepaid card
activity, which was elevated last year in connection with supporting unemployment programs, credit and debit
card fee revenue would have increased 3.0% compared with the third quarter of 2021.
The bottom half of the slide illustrates the year-over-year growth rates in both merchant processing and corporate
payments fee revenue over the last several quarters. Third quarter merchant processing revenue increased 3.6%
year-over-year. Growth was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates given market
volatility in Europe and specifically in the UK. Excluding the FX impact, year-over-year growth in merchant fee
revenue was approximately 9.4%.
Slide 15 provides some additional information on our payment services business. On the right side of the slide,
you will see the continued strong momentum we are seeing in our tech-led revenue and partnerships within our
merchant acquiring business. The key to that trajectory is the strong growth we have seen in new tech-led
partnerships. Through the third quarter, new tech-led partnerships, year-to-date, were 2.5 times the number of
new partnerships we had acquired in the entire year of 2019, and these partnerships are continuing to grow.
Turning to slide 16. Non-interest expense increased 1.9% on a linked quarter basis, excluding merger integration
costs associated with the pending acquisition of Union Bank. The change in expense was driven by higher
compensation, professional services and marketing and business development expenses.
Slide 17 highlights our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 common – our common equity Tier 1 capital
ratio at September 30 was 9.7%. On slide 18, I'll provide some forward-looking guidance for US Bank on a
standalone basis. Again, this guidance does not include any potential impact of Union Bank.
Let me start with full year 2022 guidance, which is consistent with our previous expectations. We continue to
expect total net revenue to increase 5% to 6% in 2022 compared to 2021. We expect mid-teen growth in taxable-
equivalent net interest income, which is slightly improved from our previous outlook of low to mid-teens growth.
We continue to expect a decline in fee revenue for the full year, primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates
on mortgage revenue due to lower refinancings in the market, lower deposit service charges due to pricing
changes and a decline in other non-interest income.
We continue to expect positive operating leverage of at least 200 basis points in 2022, excluding the impact of
merger and integration-related costs associated with the Union Bank acquisition. For the full year of 2022, we
expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 22%.
I'll now provide guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect both total revenue and total core expenses, excluding
merger and integration costs, to increase by approximately 2% on a linked quarter basis. Net interest income will
continue to be supported by earning asset growth and higher rates. However, our fee revenue will be lower,
reflecting typical seasonality in some of our fee-based businesses.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2022
Credit quality remains strong. Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than
historical levels but to normalize over time. Changes in the allowance for credit losses near term will primarily
reflect loan growth and changes in the economic outlook.
If you turn to slide 19, I'll provide an update on our previously announced pending acquisition of Union Bank. In
September of 2021, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the core regional
banking franchise of MUFG Union Bank.
We continue to make significant progress in planning for the closing of the deal in the fourth quarter of 2022 while
we await regulatory approval. As you know, regulatory approvals are not within the company's control and may
impact the timing of the closing of the deal. As a reminder, we expect to close on the deal approximately 45 days
after being granted U.S. regulatory approval. As previously discussed, we are targeting a conversion date in the
first half of 2023.
The financial merits of the deal remain intact. Our EPS accretion estimates are unchanged, and we continue to
estimate the acquisition will generate an internal rate of return of approximately 20%, which is well above our cost
of capital.
The company's target CET1 capital ratio is 8.5%. Based on interest rates as of October 13, our CET1 capital ratio
at close would approximate 8.3%. We expect the CET ratio to increase towards 9% as the purchase accounting
valuation adjustments accrete into capital through earnings.
I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Terry. The investments we have made and continue to make across our business lines are paying off in
terms of improved customer experience, new customer acquisition and deeper relationships. Expense
management is a priority, and we continue to target positive operating leverage in 2022 and beyond. We look
forward to closing on the Union Bank acquisition pending regulatory approval. This is a unique opportunity at
scale in one of our core markets, and we remain confident in the strategic and financial merits of the deal.
The current credit environment is benign. In fact, our net charge-off ratio in the third quarter remained near
historic lows and we are not seeing any meaningful early-stage metrics that causes concern. That being said, we
recognize the pressure points are building in several areas of the economy that could lead to stress in the future.
Borrowing costs are increasing, inflation is high, saving rates are starting to decline, and the stock market is well
off its highs.
So while the backdrop is favorable today, it would not be surprising to us to see an economic slowdown develop
at some point driven by lower confidence levels, which may lead to reduced spending and business investment.
There are a number of scenarios that may play out over the next several quarters. We are preparing for a range
of possible outcomes by prudently managing credit, liquidity and capital so that we continue to grow within our
through-the-cycle risk management framework and deliver industry-leading returns.
In summary, our investments are paying off. We remain diligent stewards of capital. Our balance sheet is strong.
And our focus is firmly fixed on managing the company for the long term.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] John Pancari with
Evercore is online for a question. Go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Morning, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
On your commentary around the CET1 falling to 8.3% at close but need to get back up to the 9% before you
resume buybacks, can you give us a little more color on that in terms of timing around when you think you can
reach that 9% with the PA accretion and how we should think about the magnitude of buybacks at that time?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Thanks, John. So again, our expectations at close of 8.3%, but we do expect that, that will get to roughly
9% within about four quarters. And a big part of that will be, obviously, earnings growth driven by the accretion of
the mark-to-market that will end up impacting earnings during that particular timeframe. So our expectation, and
what we have been signaling in the past, is that we would start our share buyback program once we get to that
9%. So about four quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay, all right. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just separately, can you just give us more color on the
payments trends that you're seeing both in merchant processing and corporate payments businesses? And
maybe if you could just talk about the potential moderation in activity there that you could see as the economy
reacts to the Fed action.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. John, this is Andy. And it's interesting from a credit card spend standpoint, while the categories of spend,
as we've talked about before, have shifted a bit, the level of spend is still fairly strong, about 10% on a year-over-
year basis and about 30% above pre-COVID levels. We did get impacted, as Terry noted in his prepared

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2022
comments, by the FX rate of the pound in our merchant processing. And excluding that, our revenues would have
been up just over 9%.
We can – as well sort of a related topic, we see – for two years, we have seen our consumer deposit levels by
account increase. And as we mentioned last quarter, it's been flat. It's been flat for the second quarter and it's
relatively flat, not down modestly, here in the third quarter. So we would expect some moderation of spend, but
we're not seeing it yet.

Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Matt. How are you this morning?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan Stein Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hello. This is Nathan Stein on behalf of Matt O'Connor. I just want to follow-up quickly on the payments outlook. I
think previously, you've talked about higher-than-normal year-over-year growth in the second half of this year
before moderating to high single digits next year. Just to follow-up on what you were just talking about, does that
guidance still make sense in this environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean our expectation is, with respect to our payments revenues, of high single digits. And we think that
based upon what we are seeing with respect to consumer spend at this particular point in time that that is still very
realistic. As Andy said, relative to pre-COVID, volumes are continuing to be very strong. And while there is a bit of
a shift with respect to where that spend is occurring, it's still continuing. The other thing is that where – if and
when transaction levels start to tail off, I think the impact of inflation will have an offsetting effect. So we still feel
pretty confident about it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan Stein Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thank you so much. That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up question. Can you just touch on
the plan to manage the balance sheet post the deal closing, whenever that is? I think total assets were just above
$600 billion at the end of this quarter. And with Union Bank, it will push you above the $700 billion threshold. So
how are you thinking about that going forward?

Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Our expectation is that we'll continue to manage the balance sheet in a very prudent way, looking for and
supporting relationships that are higher-profitable sort of relationships. Our expectation is that – because I think
where you're heading is really related to Cat II, our expectation is, at the earliest, that we would get into that
category is the end of 2024, but our ability to manage risk-weighted assets and balance sheet levels may extend
that to some extent.

Operator: Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo is online with a question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Mike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I think at a recent conference, you said that you will not achieve as much synergies from Union Bank next year
as you originally thought, but no change in EPS guidance. Did I hear that correctly?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. That is correct. And if you think about the dynamics, Mike, while the timing has changed and the synergies
associated with the $900 million of synergies that we expect to achieve when fully implemented, the timing will be
offset, to some extent, by the accretion of the mark-to-market will be a little bit stronger. So we still feel pretty
confident with respect to the accretion levels that we have guided in the past.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Right. So instead of 75%, you said 40% to 45%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. 40% to 50%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
40% to 50%, and 6% EPS-accretive. So if you're getting less merger synergies next year than you originally
thought and you have the same EPS guidance, are you, de facto, increasing the end result of expected accretion
from Union Bank?

Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I don't think that we're moving off of our estimates that we have provided in the past at this particular point
in time. I think we need to get beyond the closing – the approval and then the closing before we, I think, would
significantly change any estimates at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And any early guidance for next year? Some other banks are giving some general kind of guidepost for
2023 in terms of operating leverage, and your guidance is saying this would be some of the best operating
leverage in over five years, I guess, and just trying to figure out how confident you are in that continuing.
I know you invested for a number of years in the tech infrastructure, and now you hope to capitalize on that at a
time when business is coming back. But how much follow-through should investors expect for this positive
operating leverage?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Mike, we're focused on positive operating leverage on a core basis, and we'll continue to achieve that. Next
year has a fairly large moving part with Union Bank coming on. So that is going to be our top priority is to make
sure we successfully convert and integrate that in this company, which will allow for more positive operating
leverage. But that – we haven't provided any guidance update on that yet.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2022
Hi. Good morning. Terry, I'm going to have to ask you about the 8.3% pro forma CET1 that you mentioned you're
estimating at close. I think I didn't realize that there has been a significant conversation in the market that perhaps
has contributed to the three-month underperformance with concern about the widening of the interest rate marks.
So I think that at announcement, you were looking at a 50 basis point loan markup on UB's loan portfolio that
you're bringing over. Given that a significant portion of that portfolio is resi, I think there was a lot of math being
done in the buy side that was, let's say, 100 basis points lower than what you were giving us.
So, I guess, my question here is, how is the Street getting the math wrong? Or are there protections that are built
into the deal? Or are there hedges on UB's balance sheet that seems to be protecting your pro forma CET1 from
a greater day one mark relative to how interest rates have moved since announcement?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think it could be a combination of different things. I mean, for example, there is an expectation that they
will deliver a certain level of tangible book value. And to the extent that their available-for-sale portfolio is
impacted prior to the acquisition, there is kind of a make-whole provision within the agreement related to the
available-for-sale securities. So that is part of it.
I think some of it could be just what the assumptions are related to the duration of the resi portfolio. And then
again, we'll end up looking at and managing, in this rate environment, the balance sheet as prudently as we can
to ensure that we are allocating capital to the appropriate businesses during this timeframe. So it's a combination
of a different – a variety of different things, Erika.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. So, I guess, that's the question – as a follow-up question, that $6.25 billion that they have to deliver, there's
a make-whole provision on the AFS portfolio, but not on the loan portfolio, I'm presuming, is what you're saying,
Terry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
That is true. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Is there – and I'm presuming also there's a potential CDI offset at close that could help offset but,
obviously, that would be a higher amortization cost in day two and after?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yes. I mean it's a combination of a whole variety of things. I mean, it's not only the interest rate marks, but it's
what does the loan portfolio look like in terms of overall quality relative to kind of what our original estimates were.
We think that, that is slightly better than CDI. I mean you have to look at all of the different moving parts in terms
of coming up with what we think the final impact of the mark-to-market is going to be.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. So we saw a nice remixing out of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. Wanted to follow-up on that and,
more specifically, whether there's room for you to take the mix of available-for-sale higher. It'd be helpful if you
could just give some color on what guides your decision on how high the HTM mix could go?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Great question, Bill. So today, we're currently at about 53% held-to-maturity versus available-for-sale. And
we moved some securities in early July when rates dipped that allowed us to be able to kind of increase that
percentage.
The other thing that we take into consideration is the fact that with respect to the AFS portfolio, there's also
floating rate securities that have very little impact with respect to AOCI. So, when you end up combining that
together, it's about 60% that is protected – substantially protected from movements in interest rates. So think
about it almost as a 60-40 sort of split in terms of the sensitivity to interest rates.
And is there opportunity? I mean, we'll continue to look at whether that makes sense relative to our balance sheet
positioning. But at least right now, we feel pretty comfortable with that mix. It gives us the AOCI protection as well
as some flexibility with respect to managing the balance sheet.

And then the other thing you have to kind of think about is that we have Union Bank that, hopefully, we'll be
closing on here in the fourth quarter. And that ends up influencing decisions that we make with respect to the
positioning of the balance sheet and – excuse me, of the securities portfolio. And then also with respect to
deposits, we're going to have a significant amount of deposits coming on, and that's going to help us as well.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Very helpful. And separately, I wanted to follow-up on funding and more specifically, the decrease in non-interest-
bearing deposits. Is it reasonable to expect that your mix of non-interest-bearing deposits is going to gradually
revert to pre-COVID levels as the Fed proceeds with QT? Maybe if you could address that, if you have any view
sort of at the industry level and then specifically for USB?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yes. Well, I certainly think that QT is going to put pressure on deposits overall. And as interest rates rise, you'll
continue to see a shift out of non-interest-bearing toward interest-bearing. Whether – I mean, I think that the
assumption with respect to pre-COVID may make sense depending upon how much they bring their balance
sheet down, et cetera, how much liquidity they leave in the system.
With respect to us, it probably – if I had to make estimates, I would say that it probably stays a little bit better than
where it was pre-pandemic in part because we've grown our consumer portfolio, which tends to offset that. And
then we've also worked hard to focus within our corporate trust business on retaining those deposits that are more
operational in nature. And because they're more operational in nature, they tend to be more interest non-interest-
bearing as opposed to interest-bearing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That makes sense. And sticking with that theme in terms of the mix of debt relative to your overall funding, that's
still well below fourth quarter 2019 levels. Can you speak to the likelihood that we should expect that to gradually
remix back to pre-COVID levels?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Again, I think the broad assumption would be fair. But again, keep in mind that Union Bank is going to be
coming on. And they have a significant – they actually have a higher percentage within their deposit base that's
consumer-based. And so I think you have to kind of look at the entire mix. And I think we're going to be – U.S.
Bank, I think specifically, is probably going to be in a better position than we were pre-pandemic.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's great. Finally, if I could squeeze in one last one. Could you speak to your ability to bring off-balance-sheet
money market funds back on balance sheet, maybe some of the dynamics surrounding that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, great question. So currently, we have about – roughly $130 billion in money market funds. And that is a
business that's very tied to our institutional investor services business. Based upon what we need to do from a
funding perspective, we have the ability from a pricing point of view to bring that back on balance sheet or off
balance sheet, but it's pricing decisions that then influence customer behavior. And it is a great source for us from
a funding standpoint as there is more pressure on deposits going forward.

Great. Thank you for taking my questions.

Operator: Gerard Cassidy with RBC is online with a question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, good morning, Gerard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Gerard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi, Terry. Hi, Andy. Terry, I think in your comments, you talked about the residential mortgage business, and the
gain-on-sale margins were lower. And I think you referenced there's still excess capacity in that line of business.
Can you share with us your outlook? You've seen some of that capacity coming out in the fourth quarter if rates
remain elevated for the refi activity, of course, being negatively affected by elevated long-term rates.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. We certainly are seeing capacity come down in the industry. I think you've seen various announcements of
bank and non-bank mortgage operations kind of pulling back or reducing capacity. I think it probably still needs to
reset to some extent what's happening with rising rates, and the impact that it might have on both refinancing as
well as home sales, but we do see it coming down.
Our expectation is that gain-on-sale margins stabilize and, probably for us, improve a bit. In the third quarter, our
gain-on-sale was down maybe a little bit more than what we had anticipated. But about half of that is really driven
by the mix between correspondent and retail. And the other half of it is really more revenue recognition, some
timing issues and some secondary kind of market valuation issues, which we think will reverse a bit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. I saw, when we looked at your average loan portfolio, obviously, you had some very nice growth in
C&I, very strong growth year-over-year. We're hearing some market chatter. And I don't know if it's just the equity
REITs are squawking. But apparently, the commercial real estate mortgage business might be a little more less
liquid today.
Any color that you guys can offer on what you're seeing in commercial mortgage real estate? Is it an area that
you're pulling back some? I know you had growth, but maybe some color and insights on what you're hearing and
seeing and what your views are for that business.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2022
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Certainly, with respect to commercial real estate, it's an important business for us and one that we'll
continue to be very focused on. I think part of it is just dynamics in the marketplace. If you end up looking at the
large corporate REITs sort of financing, we continue to lend in that particular space. We actually probably saw
some growth in the third quarter. But we do know homebuilders are starting to pull back and even making
decisions to maybe pull out of potential projects that they were planning on doing.
And then in the middle-market space in terms of commercial real estate, it's actually still, from a pricing
standpoint, pretty competitive and people extending terms associated with that. And that's the space that we're
not comfortable with at this particular point in the cycle. So we're seeing a little bit of pressure maybe in the
middle-market space, but we're fine with that.

Operator: Ken Usdin with Jefferies is online with a question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Ken.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Hey, good morning, Terry. Thanks. I wanted to just ask a little bit more on the whole outlook for deposits. I know
you talked about the mix. Just wondering what you guys are seeing given the fact that you have a little bit of a
different mix versus most of the peers in terms of – any updates on what you're thinking about where betas
eventually go to, just given that we're in a completely different rate regime than we might have all thought here six
months ago?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll kind of start just by reiterating if we end up looking at the mix of our deposit base, it has
changed a little bit relative to maybe what we were three, four years ago, et cetera. Certainly, when we went
through the last rate rising cycle, a little stronger consumer, a little more focus around operational deposits within
our trust business, et cetera. Trust is also, on a relative basis, represents only about 15% of our deposit base
today.
And then again, think about Union Bank coming on and some of the dynamics that that will bring. But coming
back to deposit betas then maybe with that context, we're actually performing probably better than what we might
15

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2022
have expected. I think deposit betas were about – in the second quarter, about 30% coming up from about 20%.
We would expect that to be maybe in the high 30s as we get into the fourth quarter.
But certainly, as rates continue to rise and if the Fed continues to be very aggressive, it's going to migrate to
higher percentages. Our through-the-cycle estimate right now is still kind of mid-30s, but we kind of think about
the entire rate cycle that we're going through.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Okay. And then as a follow-up to that, so as that plays forward, you're still expecting good – NII growth into the
fourth quarter. Can NII – I know you're not giving 2023 guidance, but just can you help us understand like what is
the gives and takes to make – can you still grow NII post the fourth quarter sequentially? Or is it just a reality
check about some of these mix and beta functions that make that tougher?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Well, I think that we can continue to grow NII as we get beyond the fourth quarter. What I would say,
though, is that probably the pace of growth changes in the industry and that will be a function of – it will be a
function of the deposit betas changing. And the loan growth that certainly the industry has been experiencing, I
think, is very strong. I don't know whether it will keep that particular base as we kind of continue to move forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q

All right. Understood. Thank you, Terry.

On your own securities [indiscernible] (39:23) it would be helpful, maybe you could give us a sense as to how we
should be thinking about the pull to par in the AFS book. Like if – I know it's a big if, but if rates don't change from
here, how many quarters or years is it that we should be baking into our models?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2022
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Well, I think what we have said is that the duration of the portfolio is a little over five years. So if you think
about that, I think that probably gives you some guide with respect to how AOCI kind of comes into the capital
equation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So it should – it's like a longer than five-year period?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. A little bit longer, but not much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And is there anything you're thinking about with regard to restructuring the books once Union Bank comes
on?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. It's – again, we'll take a look at all of the balance sheet and kind of see where it makes sense. We do
expect that we might remix the securities portfolio when it comes on. We may end up increasing HTM as a result
of what we bring over, et cetera. So it is definitely something we will take a look at.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then just separately on the consumer lens that you have in the payment side. Could you just give us a sense
as to what you saw in 3Q? I know 3Q tends to be a relatively strong quarter for you. Any changes in behavior?
Any insights as to how you think 4Q will end up shaping up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
So, Betsy, the consumer spend levels overall continue to be strong, they were up on credit card spend about 10%
on a year-over-year basis, about 30% above pre-COVID levels.
The mix of categories has changed a bit, consistent with what we've talked about before, a little bit away from
hard goods to more services and a little bit away from nondiscretionary – to nondiscretionary form discretionary.
So that shift in spend that we have been discussing continues, but the overall levels are also still very strong.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And the savings levels of the consumers are hanging in there [indiscernible] (41:41)

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yes, Betsy. So I mentioned that we saw increases across all stratas of balances for about two years, but the last
two quarters have been stable across all the categories. So not growing anymore, but not shrinking dramatically
as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q

You bet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Ken, I just want to clarify something with respect to deposit betas, just to make sure that I've got the
percentages right. The deposit betas in the second quarter were about 20%. Deposit betas in the third quarter
were just shy of 30%. And we would expect that increase to continue as rates rise and to accelerate a bit, and
again, probably in the high 30s when we get into the fourth quarter.
