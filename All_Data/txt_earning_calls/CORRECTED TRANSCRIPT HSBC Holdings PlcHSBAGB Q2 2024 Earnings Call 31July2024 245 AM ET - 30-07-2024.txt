Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Good morning to everyone in London, and good afternoon to those joining from Hong Kong. Today is my last
results announcement before George takes over in September. I'm delighted to be handing the stewardship of the
bank over to him. George is an exceptional leader who'll understand what makes HSBC special.
I'd like to thank my colleagues around the world for everything they've done over the last five years, and I wish
George every success for the future. I have always been immensely proud of the heritage of this bank and the
strategic role it plays in the world. But when I took this job on five years ago, we didn't have the financial
performance to match our standing.
My aim was to change that. I believe we've done so and created a strong platform for future growth. This was
evidenced by the record profit performance last year and by the strong first half performance this year. Revenue

of $37.3 billion was up 1%. Profit before tax of $21.6 billion was stable on the same period last year. This
performance enabled continued strong capital generation.
Our return on tangible equity was 17%, excluding notable items. We've announced $4.8 billion of further capital
distributions today. This takes the total capital we have distributed by way of dividends and buybacks in respect of
the last 18 months to $34.4 billion.
Finally, we've updated our guidance to reflect our increased confidence about the future. We're providing new
guidance of a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025, in addition to the 2024 guidance we already had. We're
upgrading our 2024 banking NII guidance from an at least $41 billion to around $43 billion.
We're revising our 2024 ECL guidance to be back within our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40
basis points. And we're reconfirming our 2024 cost guidance of around 5% growth on a target basis. That's
despite growth of 7% in the first half which, as George will explain, is mainly due to timing differences compared
to last year.
The benefits of our strategy execution over the last five years are evidenced in our performance. Before getting
into detail on the further progress made over the last six months, please allow me to share some reflections on
our five-year journey. When we set out, there were two key strategies to delivering higher returns.
The first thing we had to do was to reshape our portfolio. Building on the work of my predecessors who initiated
important structural changes, we've continued to exit businesses and client portfolios that were non-strategic,
subscale and unprofitable, first via organic portfolio reductions, which delivered RWA savings of around $128
billion, and then via inorganic means through disposals.
The second and very important strategy, which we commenced at the same time, was to build alternative sources
of revenue growth. Within this, we've invested to grow fee income, particularly in areas where we have significant
strengths, such as Wholesale Transaction Banking and Wealth.
We've also continued to invest in our differentiated international propositions, and we've significantly lowered our
sensitivity to interest rates from approximately $7 billion of banking NII for a 100 basis points down-shock in
interest rates at 30th of June 2022, to around $3.4 billion at the end of 2023, and now down to around $2.7 billion
today.
All of this had to be underpinned by a culture of cost discipline, which we have instilled across the group. These
savings enabled us to invest in the areas I've spoken about, and this transformation has helped to improve our
financial performance. As you know, we delivered a record profit in 2023 and a mid-teens return on tangible
equity in 2023 and in the first half of 2024. It has been over 15 years since the group was generating returns at
current levels. And we now expect to sustain it this year and in 2025.
The other tangible measure of success is capital distributions to our shareholders. I'm really pleased that we've
delivered around $54 billion by way of dividends and buybacks to our shareholders over the last five years,
including the distributions announced today. And I'm especially pleased to have paid the special dividend of $0.21
per share earlier this year following the sale of HSBC Canada. I see this payment not just as a financial return, but
as a return for the loyalty that our shareholders have shown us over the recent years.
Let me now summarize the further progress evidenced in the first half. First, Wealth has been a key component of
revenue diversification strategy. It delivered two very good quarters, growing revenue by 12% in total. In

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2024
Transaction Banking, fee and other income in Global Payment Solutions grew by 4% and in Global Trade
Solutions by 1% in a very difficult environment for trade. Revenue for HSBC Innovation Banking was up 4%
quarter-on-quarter, as our new global proposition continues to gain traction.
Second, our scale markets in Hong Kong and the UK enabled us to grow profits each year, as we captured new
opportunities in both the corporate and retail businesses. As you can see, we also have positive growth in other
markets, including India, which was up 4% in the first half; and Singapore, which was up 2%.
Third, we continue to grow multi-jurisdictional client revenue in both wholesale and retail.
Fourth, we saw good growth in both customer lending and deposits in the second quarter, despite what is still a
relatively sluggish environment.
Finally, we've continued to grow the size and duration of the structural hedge to reduce our sensitivity to interest
rate movements. George has new disclosures on the expected benefits in his section.
All of this progress underlines why we expect to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible equity this year and in 2025
as well.
Let me get into some more detail. The steps we've taken to change our retail business model and our continued
investment in people and digitization have made Wealth a key driver of revenue growth. Wealth revenue was up
12% in the first half to $4.3 billion. And that growth is broad based. As you can see in the boxes on the right side
of the slide, Wealth fee and other income was up 14%. Private Banking revenue was up 16%. We attracted $32
billion of net new invested assets. And new business insurance CSM was up 77%.
Moving to the next topic, Transaction Banking revenue was stable in the first half. There was good growth in
Payments, which was up 3%. This included growth in fee and other income of 4%. This is a result of the
investment we've made to grow and digitize that business, which helped to improve our ranking from a top 4 bank
in 2022 to number 2 today.
Foreign exchange was down 8% compared to a strong performance last year when there was very high volatility.
And while trade was slightly down in the half, the pace of decline slowed to the point that it was broadly flat in the
second quarter. But we still grew our trade volumes despite global trade volumes remaining subdued, and we
also increased our market share in trade in Hong Kong to more than 26%.
On the next topic, our businesses in Hong Kong and the UK both continued to perform well in the first half. Profit
before tax in Hong Kong was up 1% on a constant currency basis. While the Hong Kong corporate loan market
remained subdued, it was resilient in the second quarter.
It's too early to call it a trend, but deposits and investment activity increased, which underlines that the rate
differential works in both directions. We attracted 345,000 new-to-bank customers in the half, as we continue to
capitalize on significant inflows into Hong Kong from customers seeking opportunities for investment.
Profit before tax in the UK business grew by 11%, excluding the gain on SVB UK last year. Customer lending was
also up 2%, but our UK business is differentiated by its connectivity with the rest of the group. In the first half, we
grew the number of UK international customers by 8% to 2.7 million customers.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2024
We have a strong international franchise. We evidenced this through our multi-jurisdictional revenue disclosures
in February. And in the first half, we grew wholesale multi-jurisdictional client revenue by 4% to $9.7 billion. And
as I said earlier, this isn't just a wholesale story. We're doing more with our international retail and wealth
customers as well.
We now have 7 million international Wealth and Personal Banking customers with revenue from these customers
up 6% to $5.4 billion. So, these are the levers that have put us on track to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible
equity this year and why we expect to deliver a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025.
With that, I'll hand over to George. Thank you.

Georges Elhedery
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Noel, and hello everyone. Before I get to the Q2 numbers, I'd like to comment briefly on the recent
announcement. I'm deeply honored by the trust placed in me to lead this great institution into the future. Many of
you may have questions about the future strategy and direction of the group. Although I don't take over as Group
Chief Executive until the 2nd of September from Noel, I'm ready to share a few high-level thoughts.
Under Noel's leadership, we have delivered financial performance and built a strong platform for growth. The
strategy of the group is working, and I'm committed to building on this. The shape of the group is broadly where
we want it to be, with the bulk of our capital and other resources deployed in our four scale activities: that's Hong
Kong, the UK, our international wholesale bank underpinned by our leading Transaction Banking capabilities, and
our Wealth proposition, particularly in Asia.
This puts us in a very strong position. In each of these activities, we have scale and sustainable competitive
advantages, and our strength are aligned to the needs of our customers. They account for the vast majority of the
economic profit we generate today and present some of our most exciting opportunities to grow over the next 5 to
10 years.
And together, they are capable of delivering above cost of capital returns sustainably through the cycle. We've
made good progress and we are now in a position to accelerate the pace of execution of the strategy with focus
and intensity, to continue to grow revenue on a sustainable trajectory, to improve operating leverage while
maintaining strong cost discipline and prudent risk management, and to continue to improve client service and
experience.
You'll also have seen that we have announced this morning that Jon Bingham has been appointed Interim Group
CFO from the 2nd of September. Jon is currently our Financial Controller and has outstanding technical
accounting and regulatory knowledge and expertise. A process to identify the next permanent Group CFO is
underway, and I will update you further in due course.
Now, though, turning to Q2. In summary, profit before tax of $8.9 billion was up $0.4 billion on the second quarter
of 2023, on a constant currency basis. In terms of the drivers, the banking NII run rate was stable on the first
quarter. There was another strong Wealth performance, while Wholesale Transaction Banking was stable on last
year's second quarter. Despite cost growth of 7% in the first half, on a target basis, we remain on track to meet
our 2024 guidance of around 5% cost growth. And there was growth in both loans and deposits in the quarter.
On the next slide; so HSBC Canada contributed around $0.5 billion of revenue and around $0.2 billion of profit
before tax in the quarter, before the sale completed in March. To make like-for-like comparisons easier, these

contributions and some other impacts have been excluded from some of the commentary. So, excluding notable
items and the impact of strategic transactions, profit before tax was up 7% to $9.1 billion. Revenue of $16.5 billion
was up $0.3 billion on the second quarter of last year. Excluding notable items and the impact of strategic
transactions, revenue was up $0.8 billion or 5% on the second quarter of last year.
Banking NII of $10.9 billion was down $0.4 billion on the first quarter on a reported FX basis, primarily because of
a $0.3 billion reduction from the Canada sale. Excluding this, the banking NII run rate was stable. We're now in a
position to upgrade our 2024 banking NII guidance to around $43 billion. This assumes a $1 billion contribution
from Argentina, which was its reported NII in 2023. Although we note that it remains volatile and difficult to predict.
We're also providing new details to help you understand the expected benefits from the structural hedge. Around
$55 billion of assets are due to mature in the second half of 2024, with an average yield of 2.8% and around $105
billion of assets will mature in 2025, with an average yield of 2.8% as well.
Turning to fee and other income. Wholesale Transaction Banking was stable on the second quarter of last year,
or up 2% excluding the impact of strategic transactions. Within this, Global Payment Solutions had another good
quarter, up 2%; as did Securities Services, which was up 3%. Foreign exchange delivered broadly stable revenue
compared to a strong quarter last year.
And Wealth had another very good quarter, underlying that our investment is continuing to drive improved results.
Wealth fee and other income was up by 13% compared to last year's second quarter. Private Banking was a
standout performer, mainly driven by increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in Asia.
But growth in Wealth remained broad based. Customer growth and improved wealth penetration, primarily in Asia,
helped drive growth in investment distribution. Invested assets were up 2% to $1.3 trillion, including $6 billion of
net new invested assets in the quarter. And our insurance new business CSM was $0.6 billion, up $0.2 billion on
the second quarter of last year.
On credit, expected credit losses were $0.3 billion in the quarter, equivalent to 15 basis points of average loans.
This included $0.4 billion of recoveries and other items mentioned on the slide. Excluding these, ECLs were
broadly in line with our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points.
Stage 3 balances were 2.4% of customer loans, up $1.4 billion compared to the first quarter. This was driven by
Hong Kong commercial real estate book, but there was a limited impact on ECL charge because of the high level
of collateralization. We are revising our 2024 ECL guidance to our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to
40 basis points of average loans.
Next, costs grew by 7% in the first half on a target basis, but we remain on track to meet our guidance of 2024
cost growth of around 5%. 2 percentage points of cost growth in the first half came from higher performance-
related pay accrual and levies. As we explained at the first quarter, we have phased the accrual of our
performance-related pay more evenly this year than last year.
We do not expect the total amount of performance-related pay for 2024 to be materially different to 2023, so the
accrual in the second half is expected to be lower year-on-year. In addition, the second half of last year included
$0.3 billion of levies that we do not expect to repeat this year. We are, therefore, reconfirming our guidance of
around 5% cost growth for 2024 on a target basis, and we remain committed to cost discipline.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2024
On lending and deposits, there was positive loan growth in the quarter in both the UK and Asia, whilst Hong Kong
was broadly stable. Overall, there were promising signs in the first half. Deposits were up 2%, with the majority of
this in Hong Kong. There was also growth in the UK, Europe and the US and the rest of Asia. But it also included
the benefits of seasonality in Commercial Banking and a large one-off in Global Banking and Markets. So, I would
encourage you not to annualize the 2% figure.
Next, our CET1 ratio was 15%, down 20 basis points on the first quarter, as strong organic capital generation was
offset by distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We have announced a new share buyback of
up to $3 billion, which we expect to complete within three months and to have an impact of around 0.4 percentage
points on our CET1 ratio in the third quarter.
Finally, to recap, our strong first half performance and our confidence about the bank's position enable us to
provide new guidance of a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items, for 2025, in addition to
our existing mid-teens guidance for 2024; upgrade our 2024 banking NII guidance from at least $41 billion to
around $43 billion; revise our 2024 ECL guidance to within our normal medium-term planning range of 30 to 40
basis points; and reconfirm our guidance for 2024 cost growth of around 5% on a target basis; and a mid-single-
digit loan growth over the medium term.
With that, Louise, can we please go to Q&A? Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. George. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Andrew Coombs at
Citigroup. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.

Hi, Andrew.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Coombs Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Good morning. Thank you both for the comments. A couple of questions from my side; one big picture, one into
the numbers. And firstly, big picture question. Noel, you highlighted all the things you can be proud of during your
tenure, but perhaps with the benefit of hindsight, be interested in any thoughts you have on anything you might
have done differently. And then linked to that as well, George, I think you were on the tape this morning talking
about accelerating the existing execution. So, any tangible examples you can provide on that would be helpful as
well.
And then in terms of the numbers question, thank you for the additional disclosure around the structural hedge. I
think you talked about $55 billion maturing in the second half at 2.8% yield. Is it fair to assume the new positions
that you're putting on are probably about a percent higher than that, given where the forward curve is? So, prior to
any offset from adding to the existing structural hedge notional, it's about $0.5 billion of NII uplift. Is that fair?

Andrew, thanks for your questions. I'll take the first one. Listen, I've got no regrets, Andrew. I think to perform in
this role is an absolute privilege. And, look, you never finish with an institution like this and that's why George is
right to comment that you always want to do more, there's always things you want to improve. There's always
investment you can do to grow more revenue to improve customer experience, improve systems and processes.
So, there's never a notion of finishing. There should always be a notion of continuous improvement and
continuous ambition.
And I think that's probably the bridge from me to George, because I have no regrets about the last five years. I
think we've done a lot of good things, and I thank my colleagues for everything they've done. But equally, you
should never be complacent and think the job is finished. The job of running an organization as large as ours and
with so much opportunity before us to further improve is never finished. And that's the bridge over to George now
to take it on to the next level and to continue to execute the strategy.
So, George, hand to you on both of the next two questions, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Noel. Yes, Andrew, [ph] and he was (00:26:49) just echoing Noel and building on that. We've called out
some of the key areas of our strategy. I've called out Hong Kong, the UK, the international wholesale bank, which
is underpinned by a leading Transaction Banking capabilities as well as Wealth, all of which have demonstrated
very strong momentum certainly over the last few years, but definitely over the first half of this year.
We're confident about the momentum, we're confident in our ability to continue investing in them, and we're
confident also we have ample capital to support additional growth. So, it's just about getting continued pace in the
execution of this strategy that has proved its results.
On your question about the structural hedge, Andrew, so $55 billion are expected to mature over the course of the
second half at an average yield of 2.8%. If I try to reverse-engineer your math, and if you assume the
reinvestment happens at around 3.8% with a 1% uplift, then you get $500 billion, but remember, this is maturities
that are happening over the course of the half. Therefore, I think you have to average the number and, therefore,
you have to assume half the number as an in-year 2024 benefit from that structural hedge reinvestment; so, say,
the half of your $0.5 billion you quoted.
Also bear in mind that we are increasing the structural hedge, subject to market conditions. We've done about €25
billion in the first half. It's a good estimate of the run rate for the second half. And that is a mild headwind because
we're increasing the hedge from higher short-term rates into lower longer-term rates due to the inversion of the
curve. So, you have to take all of this into consideration when factoring in the impact for 2024 banking NII.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2024
Hey. Thank you for taking my questions. So, I have three. Firstly, I was a bit surprised to get the 2025 profitability
target, which does seem to be a little bit above consensus. I think consensus is about 14%. So, I guess a bit of
variation on mid-teens, but if that's kind of 15%, 16%, 17%. Just curious where you see a bit more upside. Is that
mainly on the revs or can you see a bit more cost control?
And then just linked to that, Georges, I think in your comments as well, you talked about growing revenues on a
sustainable basis. So, just curious, again, how you're thinking about that potentially with some NII headwinds.
And then lastly, Noel, I think you used the term sluggish or subdued a few times when talking about the
environment. Just curious when you think that will potentially turn and we can see a more constructive
environment for some of those markets. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sounds good. Amit, I'll ask George to answer the first one. I think he's probably best and on the mid-teens and the
definition of mid-teens and then also maybe sustainable revenue. And then I'll cover the third.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Very good. Thank you, Amit. So, consensus – if you adjust consensus for 2025 for the impact of the loss from the
sale of Argentina which, by the way, as we communicated now, we expect by the end of the year. Therefore, it's
more reasonable to assume that that loss, the recycling of the foreign exchange loss of $5 billion, which has no
impact on capital or on distribution, it's fair to assume that impact will happen in 2024.
But if you adjust the consensus in 2025, you get to around 14% indeed. Our definition of mid-teens is broadly
around 14% to 16%. So, without commenting on the consensus, our mid-teens definition is broadly that 14% to
16% range.
On the growing revenue on a sustainable basis, let me point you to three major indicators, which are going to be
important in the way we look at the future. The first one related to banking NII. Banking NII, number one, has
been stabilized partly with the reduction of banking NII sensitivity.
If you recall, two years ago, we called out $7 billion to be the impact on banking NII on our revenue for a 100
basis point drop in interest rates. That number at the year-end was $3.4 billion. And that number, as we reported
it now, is $2.7 billion. So, therefore, we have, through activities of structural hedging but also through other
methodology improvements and balance sheet composition, we have reduced the dependency of our earnings
and of our banking NII to the impact of lower rates.
The second component, again, relating to banking NII is that while for a few quarters we've seen subdued loan
growth in particular in the UK and Hong Kong wholesale market, we have now seen stabilization. It's early to call it
a trend, but we are encouraged by the stabilization we've observed. And importantly, we will be more encouraged
to when we see rates coming off and the support they can have for loan growth, in particular, in these two areas
that historically have been a little bit more sluggish.
Other parts of our activity remained resilient. Loan growth in South and Southeast Asia remained very strong.
Loan growth in the mortgage businesses in the UK and Hong Kong remained very strong. So, there is a volume
component to banking NII, which we supported. And as you can see from our capital, we have ample capacity to
support loan growth.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2024
And the third component I will call out is the non-banking NII part of our earnings, fees and other income, in
particular, Wholesale Transaction Banking and Wealth. You've seen the momentum in these businesses. You've
seen the continued investment we've put in these businesses. We believe these momentums are sustainable.
There's an underlying sustainable trend supporting Wealth, in particular, in Asia. And there is an additional
support through our own investments, both technology and people relationship management related to support
growth in this area, and we believe the momentum is sustainable. So, those are the big – broadly three
components that we believe will sustain our earnings as we look into the future.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And, Amit, just to come a little bit more elaboration on the sluggish, subdued, listen, I'm not surprised that the
corporate loan market is a bit subdued at the moment. I think it's right for that to be the case because in the higher
interest rate environment, there's not many corporates out there who want to borrow at today's interest rates. And
actually, they've still got a lot of cash sitting on their balance sheet. They don't need to borrow, which is a good
position to be here.
But as you see interest rates come down, I would expect there to be a pickup in activity. And I suppose, what
George just said is, we're starting to see the very early signs of that starting to emerge. It's very early. It's too early
to call it a trend. But I was pleased in Hong Kong, the rate of decline in the corporate lending book in Hong Kong
in Q1 reduced dramatically.
So, we'd been declining through 2023. And it actually plateaued in the Q2 and it was – and that's in Hong Kong.
And then in the rest of Asia, we saw a growth in Q1 and Q2. And in the rest of the world, we saw growth in Q1
and Q2. So, Q1 was the first time we saw net growth in corporate lending. Q2, we saw net growth as well. So, I
think it's encouraging early signs. As interest rates come off, I see that happening.
And the other thing is, you've also got to remember, there's another side to the Hong Kong market. The deposit
market in the investment market is very strong, as you saw in our Wealth businesses. Now, the net new invested
assets going in to the business, so I think in the first half of this year was about $34 billion, if I remember correctly.
And I think as rates come off, cash moves into invested assets.
And I think we're seeing – we're a beneficiary of that, particularly in Hong Kong, where rate differentials are
playing strongly into the investment market, whereas they're subduing, the rate differentials are subduing the
demand for loans in the Hong Kong market. But the rate differential is working in the opposite direction on
investments. Okay. Next question?

Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Joseph, thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph Dickerson Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just a couple of quick things, so on the RoTE guidance, if you look in the
first half of the year, you've kind of done an underlying number of 17%, and that was with some – you've had a
few credit headwinds, but generally benign. I mean, I guess if you think about things like cash moving into
invested assets, which should be higher ROE, your Wealth and Personal banking ROE is around 31%. At the
moment, you're doing about a 22% UK ROE.
I guess, what would hold you back from maintaining that level in 2025 and 2026, notwithstanding some rate cuts?
It seems like there's a lot more flex in the [ph] models and your business model (00:37:10). And I know you need
to be conservative, but I guess, is it rates that would hold you back lack of activity? And I guess that the follow-on
question – yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Joseph, yeah, I think it's a fair observation, but I think – and we're not being conservative for the sake of being
conservative. I think it is too early to call a return to volume growth in the corporate loan market in substantial
proportions. I think we all expect the rates to come off and cash to move from cash to invested assets. I think
we're just – it's still a bit early in the cycle. There's a lot of uncertainty still out there.
And I think given our guidance of mid-teens, which is somewhere between the 14% and 16% range, is fair at this
point in time. I think the most important thing we've tried to do over the past few years is deliver each quarter and
let each quarter be the base for the future. So, I think it's better to set reasonable and sensible guidance, and then
we continue to evidence progress against that as quarter by quarter go. So, I don't think we're in the mold as an
institution of being overly bullish one way or the other, particularly when there's still quite a bit of uncertainty out
there.
But, George, is there anything you want to add?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. No, nothing, Noel. You covered it. I mean just one parameter also just to add is just remember to remove
the impact of Argentina with the expected sale taking place at the end of this year in your 2025 assessments.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2024
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Raul, good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Thank you for taking my questions. I was just trying to dig into some of your commentary around the hedge. I was
wondering – I've got two questions. The first one is just trying to understand how the notional size of the hedge is
changing in the UK versus the rest of the world. My understanding was that the structural hedging in the UK was
quite a mature book.
So, I wouldn't have expected that to increase in size going forward. And I would think that most of the low-yielding
refinancings are coming from the UK. Whereas when we think about the rest of the world, it looks like your
structural hedging was more recent. So, there's probably scope to increase that, but maybe the refinancing yield
is a bit higher. Is that the kind of right understanding, is the first question?
The second question is just coming to the Hong Kong CRE book and some of the disclosure [ph] we've pulled out
(00:39:59) there. I think $36 billion of total exposure, 40% of that is unsecured. I was just wondering if you could
give us a little bit more additional color around the unsecured part of Hong Kong CRE. I think you say it's very
good quality, but how you look to manage the risks given the unsecured nature of this CRE book? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you. George, do you want to pick up both of those?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure, Noel. So, Raul, on the hedge size, we haven't given the specific currency split or balance sheet split. But,
yes, you should assume the sterling component is one of the largest component in terms of the hedge size. And
the UK, therefore, the sterling component is one of the most mature by way of size of hedge, but there is
obviously still – or previous hedges maturing, previous hedges struck at lower yields maturing, and we're able to
benefit from the reinvestment of maturing hedges at higher yield. That was still a component in the UK bank's
NIM, which has been broadly stable, and we expect to remain broadly stable and the structural hedge
reinvestment is playing a role in that.
With regards to the rest of the world, it's a story of two tales, indeed. There is the reinvestment of all structural
hedges at higher yields, and that is a tailwind in our banking NII. There is also additional hedges we're doing
where we can, and these additional hedges are suffering from [ph] a partial set-off – or is partial offset to them
(00:41:34) as a headwind because they're suffering from the fact that [ph] credits are unrated (00:41:42), but it's
still the right thing to do for the management of our banking NII sensitivity.
And then, obviously, always keep in mind that the Hong Kong dollar exposure we have remains largely under-
hedged, and that's due to the fact that the structure of the market does not give us enough instruments to be able
to invest in the long term to support hedging. So, the Hong Kong dollar would remain structurally under-hedged in
that sense.

With regards to the Hong Kong CRE question, so 40% of the book is – of the $36 billion you mentioned is
unsecured. It is typically exposure to large conglomerates with a diversified revenue stream, including revenue
streams from activities not related to real estate. 90% of that book today is rated strong and good and literally 0%
is in the impaired category. We're very comfortable with the exposure we have in that book and we continue
obviously supporting our customers through the cycle in this space.

Dekai Hou Q
Analyst, China International Capital Corp. Ltd.
Okay. Good morning, Noel. Good morning, George. My first question is on the non-interest income. If my math is
correct, my calculation shows that our adjusted non-interest income is $5.8 billion this quarter compared to $5.3
billion a year ago. And we had $200 million growth on Wealth. Transaction Banking is relatively stable, so since
GBM contributed a lot this quarter. So, I understand that this business has seasonality and is volatile. But do you
expect that momentum to continue going forward? Or do you think in the second half of last year is relatively a
weak comparison?
Yeah. The second question is a broader one. Because I realize now you speak less about focusing Asia these
days than you used to and emphasizing more on the global network. Yes, sometimes in some ways they do
intersect, but I'm wondering, do you still focus on exploring some bolt-on opportunities in Asia and Wealth
business in the future? And do you have a capital distribution hierarchy or preference among dividend, buyback
and growth? Yeah. Thank you.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2024
were mainly driven from two areas. The first one is Wealth, which is obviously a very strategic area where we
continue to invest and exhibited growth.
The other one was from markets, in particular, from some of the equity business in markets. This is coming on the
basis of two components. One, a subdued Q2 last year. So, there was a base effect which benefited the outlook
for the Q2 this year. And then the second one is the fact that we've seen more activity and more vigorousness in,
if you want, the Asian stock markets, in particular, the Hong Kong stock market. And we're encouraged by this.
And if the trend continues, this will bode well for additional activity in this space.
Let me jump to the third question, and I'll hand over to Noel to conclude on the second one. Capital distribution
hierarchy. First, we've committed to 50% dividend payout ratio for this year, which means half our earnings will be
earmarked for foreseeable dividend. Part of it will be distributed through our interim dividends. The rest will be
netted out at the end of the year.
After that, we obviously will use capital to support the organic growth of our business. Loan growth, as we said
earlier, started to pick up in certain areas. We are encouraged, but we have ample capital to support the loan
growth, the appetite we have. We look at bolt-on acquisitions or areas that are dead on strategy, both supportive
of acceleration of the strategy. That will be part of utilization of excess capital and any excess beyond that we will
distribute back to shareholders through a rolling series of share buybacks.
If you look at our CET1 ratio today at 15% and you look at our capital accretion that we remain capital generative
in the business based on the guidance we've given for this year and next year, we're confident we will have
capacity to deliver on the three. And I will say the buybacks, we'll continue looking at it on a quarter-by-quarter
basis with the ambition to have a rolling series of share buybacks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Jeremy. On your second question, is it an Asia strategy? Is it an international strategy? I think they're
interchangeable. I don't think they're mutually exclusive. Because if you look at what we do at the core of what
we've done for 158 years or more, is we've connected entrepreneurs and businesses who want to trade with the
world. That's what we've done from day one of HSBC being founded. So, we're essentially about helping
businesses and individuals trade internationally, invest internationally.
Now, why are they one and the same? Well, a huge amount of the entrepreneurs that we have as clients are
based in Asia, they're based in the Middle East, they're based in the East, and they trade with the West. And the
West trades with the East. And Asia and the Middle East are high-growth markets. So, I don't think it's an
either/or. I think for us, it's very simple, that is we're internationally driven. And Asia is a hugely connected
international part of the world and will remain so going forward. The nature of trade will change as it has done for
158 years.
So, I think we use the words Asia and [ph] internationals and (00:48:28) probably interchangeably, and
sometimes it gets people confused. We're investing where there is growth and where we have differentiation.
There is growth, there is international connectivity. There is differentiation in Asia. There is in the Middle East.
And we have the same here in the UK or fundamentally at the core, we're an international bank.

Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
And just wanted to wish you the very best going forward, whatever it is you decide to do. And, George, on a
similar theme, just to extend my congratulations around your appointment as CEO.
I had two questions, please, both on net interest income. So, a point of clarification, I guess, your banking NII
guide this year of circa $43 billion at face value does imply a material step-off in net interest income in H2. I just
wanted to check, I mean you're guiding for Argentina being $1 billion this year and I think it was the best part of
$900 million in H1.
So, is it literally just Argentina dropping out of net interest income in H2 is driving that? And what would really,
really help is the kind of momentum of NII in H2 and the extent to which that carries over into 2025. I'm not
necessarily looking for an updated guide here. But if I just take again your banking NII disclosure at face value, it's
implying a kind of $42 billion annualized run rate in H2 ex-Argentina. What do you think the puts and takes are on
that if we were to kind of look a bit further afield beyond this year?
And then the second question was if I could just get you to update your thoughts around deposit pass-throughs,
you're obviously noting you've hedged more of your balance sheet now. And what if actually pass-throughs were
to be, say, 10% lower than what you're modeling in your updated banking NII sensitivity, that would be really
helpful. Thank you very much.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2024
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Thanks, Noel. Aman, thank you. So, on your first question, look, around $43 billion of banking NII for this
year is a reasonable expectation. And we're more confident about it because we're already seven month into the
year. And somewhat the forward rate outlook has become a bit less volatile than we've experienced over the last
few months.
Argentina, we have worked with a planning assumption of $1 billion. So, within our around $43 billion, we've
factored in around $1 billion contribution from Argentina. It is a very difficult to predict number. It is a very volatile
number and, therefore, the best of estimate you can use around $42 billion and add whatever other expectations
you may have for Argentina, but we're sticking with this $1 billion estimate on the uncertainty. Just for reference,
$1 billion was the banking NII contribution of Argentina in 2023, and this is how we're building the assumption for
planning for this year.
Now, if you look forward for H2, headwinds and tailwinds facing the banking NII. The first one to call out is the
rates outlook. We're using the mid-July curves, which comprise broadly between one and two rate cuts across all
the major currencies in the second half. This is the working assumption. The second one is on the structural
hedge. So, as we called out earlier, you should expect to benefit from the $55 billion maturing assets in 2H at
2.8% yields, which would be reinvested at higher yields than at the prevailing yields in H2, which will be higher,
take a five-year rate as a good benchmark for what rates will be reinvested at.
But this is partly offset by the additional structural hedging we are likely to do on an inverted curve. Again, here,
your best guide is what we've done in H1. $25 billion of additional structural hedging is a reasonable run rate to
expect for H2, but will depend on market conditions in H2.
The other components that are playing as headwinds and tailwinds are the balance sheet growth. We continue to
see strong growth in South and Southeast Asia. We continue to see resilience in the mortgage books in the UK
and Hong Kong. But we are now encouraged to see stability in the Hong Kong wholesale book, which has been
on a decline for a few quarters. It's early to call it a trend, but it is now – it is definitely green shoots when we look
forward, and it will be supported with rate reductions as in the balance sheet growth in this space.
And then the last one to call out is deposit migration. That's particularly true in Hong Kong. Again, Q1, Q2, we've
seen migration at 0% and 1%, respectively, which is 1% overall on the half. Just to put it in perspective, this is
after full-year 2023, where we've seen 12%. So, again, the trend here is much more encouraging. We're very
unlikely to see anywhere near the trend of last year, but it remains a difficult one to predict.
Now, as you look forward into the full-year 2025, we're not guiding on banking NII, but a few points for you to bear
in mind. The first one is please remove Argentina's contribution, again, working assumption, $1 billion. This is
following the planned sale of Argentina to take place before the end of the year.
Second, remove the one quarter contribution from Canada, $0.3 billion in your NII. Then we've shared that there
will be $105 billion of existing structural hedge assets, which will mature in 2025 with an average yield of 2.8%.
So, those will provide some tailwind as we reinvest them at higher yield.
So, beyond that, you can apply your own interest rate assumptions on the banking NII sensitivity we provided.
$2.7 billion is the sensitivity we provided across all currencies for a 100 basis point drop. And you can apply your
balance sheet growth assumption. And again, we believe lower rates will be more supportive of growth in balance

sheet when you look into 2025. But basically, all of that is factored into our guidance for return on tangible equity
for 2025 at mid-teens.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
So, thank you very much for all that color. It was excellent. Just around pass-throughs, I think...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, on deposit – sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Earlier this year, you talked about 10% lower betas adding something like $600 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. So, the banking NII sensitivity to 10% change in pass-through rates is around $600 million. This remains
around $600 million. And this is based off an assumption of around $600 billion of IPCAs. So, we can work out the
math, if you want, offline. That number is broadly stable. We're still working on an assumption of a 50% pass-
through in our banking NII sensitivity.
Second, if you look at the cumulative pass-throughs, we're broadly around 50% from the start of the rate hikes in
late 2022 all the way to now, broadly around 50%. The earlier part was much lower than 50%. The latter part was
much higher than 50%. It is difficult to predict how pass-throughs will work out on the rate cut scenario, and this is
why I think 50% remains a good estimate of what it could look like, noting that we don't have recent history of that.
I would point you to one thing to be mindful of is in the UK and a number of other geographies, we will have to
provide customer notice of at least 60 days before we pass through rate cuts. So, there will be a delay in pass-
throughs on the way down, and that's a 60 to 90 day on average, for instance, in the UK. Thank you, Aman.

Edward Firth Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods
...benefits us all. My two questions were – the first one was, could you tell me – you probably disclosed it
somewhere and I've missed it, but performance-related pay, I see you're assuming that's going to be flat this year.
Is it possible to tell us what the total quantum of that is because I guess there must be some potential that that
may have to go up, particularly given the revenue performance? So, that would be my first question.
And then the second one was, to me, if I look at these results, I guess the standout to me was the performance in
Q2 of the Wealth and Private Banking business. If I look in the past, it's generally been quite seasonal in Q2, but it
seems that actually it's held up pretty flat. So, should we expect that? Is that like a sort of new base level of run
rate? Is that something we should continue into the second half now and then sort of grow on from there? Or was
there something about Q2 which held it up better than we might have expected? Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, firstly, thank you for your comments. And on your second point on Wealth, listen, I'll give a very personal
comment. You normally expect Q1 to be the seasonal high and then a bit lower in Q2 and a bit lower. So,
actually, Q2 did exceed expectations in terms of seasonality. It was a strong quarter. At the moment, [ph] I can't
(00:59:33) – we tend to be a bit on the conservative side and say, don't base a trend on a quarter or two. But I
think your assessment there actually Q2 was a strong performance is exactly where we are. It was stronger than
probably one would have expected through normal seasonality.
I think it is – if I talk to the team, they were confident of a good performance. They're seeing good lead indicators.
I mean we've taken in, in excess of $250 billion of net new invested assets just over the last two and a bit years,
2.5 years. And I think we've all got to probably – we haven't seen this period where how will cash move from cash
to invested assets as interest rates come off.
And therefore, I think it is difficult to predict a trend. I think we just got to see it go quarter by quarter, but the lead
indicators are good. We've invested in the business over the last few years to put us in this position. It was all
about getting ready for lower interest rates and being in a position to take advantage of it.
We invested heavily in the product lineup for our clients to make sure that if they were going to move into invested
assets, they could do so with us rather than another bank. And we invested in distribution. We had good
distribution in Hong Kong, but we didn't have as good a distribution in other markets. So, we built our distribution
in Mainland China, in Singapore, in India and in the rest of the world.
So, I think it's put us a good position to take advantage of it, but it's too early to call it a trend. But your
observation is a fair observation for Q2. It was good. And it's nice to be able to report that. On performance-
related pay and costs, I mean I'll let George cover that, but we're absolutely committed to the 5%, so.

Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, we paid $3.8 billion through full year 2023 on performance-related pay. This is disclosed in our annual reports
and accounts. But if you look at how we accrued for that number through the year in 2023, we actually under-
accrued in the first quarter 2023. And then we topped it up at the fourth quarter to get to that total number.
When you look at full year 2024, we are accruing towards a broadly similar number for the full year than for the
full year 2023. And any decision on the performance-related pay will take place in January with the remuneration
committee after the full year's performance has been delivered. But we are accruing broadly to the same number.
The difference is that we're accruing more evenly. So, this is why you'll see a higher accrual on a year-on-year
basis in the first half, and you will be seeing a lower accrual in the second half on that trajectory. All of this is
factored in our cost guidance of limiting cost growth to around 5%. We're absolutely committed to our 5% or circa
5% cost growth guidance. We're confident we can deliver it, and we are on track to deliver it.

Katherine Lei Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd.
Hi. Good morning. Hi, good morning. Thanks for answering my questions. I have one question – actually two,
both related to capital. On the capital side, we saw there is $6.4 billion of addition to RWA. May I know like what is
that related to? I think [ph] in the notes (01:03:33), is that something related to modeling? So, I would like to know
like what kind of assumption changes leads to this $6.4 billion? And is that one-off? Or should we see it as
ongoing, I will say, additions to the RWA? So, this is number one.
Number two, we noticed some deterioration on asset quality on Hong Kong CRE book. Actually, according to the
disclosures, the deterioration seems quite significant as well. Can you explain to us what is the impact on capital,
because we understand that there is limited impact on ECL charges, but mainly reflected on capital?
So, what is the drag on capital? And then also like going forward, whether it's your view on Hong Kong CRE, in
particular, for the loans which are already in Stage 3 categories, are you expecting that there will be recovery of

loans? Thank you.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2024
Sure. Sure, Noel. Thanks. Katherine, so on the capital, so we've indicated a $6.4 billion increase in RWAs due to
modeling adjustment. To be specific, we've adjusted the probability of default models for banks globally. And the
reason we adjusted this probability for default model for banks is because we wanted to factor in some of the
observations and learnings from the March 2023 crisis, in the way governments have supported a bank
resolution, that's specifically true for the US and Switzerland.
We've taken those learnings. We've baked them in our modeling, and this resulted in this additional RWA. Insofar
that bank models, probability of default, et cetera are concerned, we consider this to be done. And if you ask me,
well, we continuously look at our models in a general fashion. Look, the next big model update is going to be
Basel 3.1, as and when Basel 3.1 becomes live in the various geographies or jurisdictions where we operate. We
have not indicated the impact, which we do not expect to be material, but we're waiting to see some of the final
rules that are still missing in a number of jurisdictions before we can call out the exact impact to the market, but
we don't expect it to be material.
In terms of Hong Kong CRE, we've spoken earlier about the 40% that is unsecured with which we remain very
comfortable. So, your question probably relate to the other 60%, which is the secured portfolio of our $36 billion
exposure. So, of this, about $3.2 billion are credit impaired. What's happening basically is a number of – a few of
our customers basically are facing some short-term cash flow pressure challenges, and this is partly due to high
rates.
But the balance sheet remains strong and our level of collateralization remains strong. Typically, for this impaired
$3.2 billion portfolio, the level of collateralization on average is 55% loan to value. So, that this is why there is a
material, if any, ECL impact from the designation to now Stage 3.
In terms of the capital impact, some of – depending on which models we're using and what form of lending it is,
some of the impact may manifest in RWAs and we've seen a little bit of that in last quarter. Some of it will
manifest in EEL, excess expected loss, which will go straight into our CET1. We publish these numbers, but by
and large, these are immaterial numbers. And again, it's all supported by the fact that we have a very strong level
of collateralization against the exposure.
As we look forward, first, these customers, the specifically credit impaired customers are current, remain current.
We expect some of the pressure they're facing to ease as rates reduce and as economic activity in Hong Kong
picks up. In terms of medium to long-term outlook for the sector, we are actually positive. We are confident first in
the Hong Kong economy, in general, to rebound. But in particular, for the sector, we expect that this sector's
pressure will ease in the medium to long term, and we remain confident and positive about this sector.

Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, yeah, we're good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gurpreet Singh Sahi Q

Okay. Good morning. Noel, first of all – and George, congrats and Noel, congratulations for a new path, wherever
you choose to be.

Gurpreet Singh Sahi Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC
Thank you for the helpful disclosures on the hedge, et cetera. I have a question regarding – two questions, which
are pretty much linked regarding falling rates and how does the management see it. First of all, the wealth
income, it's an odd cycle with wealth income and AUM growth rates being elevated as interest rates are high. So,
when they do fall, do we have any precedent as to whether they will be an impact on the wealth income from
falling rates or we don't get that much benefit from income. We see right now that a lot of Mainland Chinese
money is also coming out and parking in Hong Kong. So, that's the first part of the question.
The second is lending growth, we have targets for mid-single digit. But when we think about modeling banking
NII, we have to look at average interest-earning asset. So, I'm wondering, we have lots of liquidity on the balance
sheet. If rates do fall, and then some of these depositors don't feel incentivized, do we get overall deposit growth
not so strong, which in turn leads to average interest-earning assets not growing and hence we should not be
modeling in average interest-earning assets growth at mid-single digits, or help us [ph] shrink out there
(01:10:13). Thank you so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. I think George will pick up both of those.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Very good. Thanks, Noel. Gurpreet, so, first, wealth income, the way we report it essentially is fees and other
income. So, the slide I have there for Wealth, that's particularly the fees part, which is fees earned on asset under
management or on – for insurance, in particular, related to new business CSM.
So, the impact, if you want, on rates is more about the transition of customers from deposits into AUMs. So, this
has been happening. We are seeing some of our deposits move into net new invested assets and transferring, if
you want, to AUMs in our Wealth proposition. It is likely, on a trend basis, that when rates come down and deposit
– the earnings you can make on deposits reduce, that customer may shift some of it into AUMs through – will be
visible in our net new invested asset proposition, and then we will be able to service them in the fee space.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2024
So, yes, there is a component where we do expect more wealth activity to take place as we see deposits being
less remunerative, but this is more on a broad trend basis, not a direct linkage. And we are also benefiting from
the structural growth of Wealth, in particular, in Asia, where we believe the underlying market is growing at very
high-single digit, if not double-digit percent over the next five years. And on top of that underlying growth, which
we're benefiting from, we are taking market share because of our additional investment in this space. So, this is
definitely a platform that can benefit from a number of trends that will support the momentum.
On your second point, it's a very good point because we talk about balance sheet growth and loan growth, but we
have also strong dependence for our banking NII to deposit growth, which constitute the underlying for our
average interest-earning assets. So, we've seen this quarter deposit growing 2%. I caution you not to annualize
the 2% because some of it is seasonal, some of it is one-off. But we have a fantastic deposit franchise. I mean
you know us, everywhere we operate, we have a very strong balance sheet that's very appealing, and we have a
very strong proposition in deposits and transaction banking for both wholesale and retail, which mean that we will
continuously look to capture deposits.
We continue winning Global Payment Solutions mandates in the wholesale space. We continue being attractive
for retail customers and we just shared, Noel shared 345,000 new customers joining our Hong Kong business
alone. In the UK, in 2023, we added 1 million new customers. So, therefore, we do continue seeing a good
momentum, underlying momentum to grow our deposits with this very attractive deposit franchise of ours.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Listen, I think I'd reinforce that and add another comment. The trick for us in the past, we were very good as a
retail bank. We were very good as a corporate bank. But when customers, whether they were retail customers or
corporate customers, wanting to invest in alternative asset classes other than cash, they tended to go to other
banks because our product range and our distribution wasn't strong enough.
We deliberately set out to invest in our products and distribution capability for Wealth. So, that cash, if it did move,
it moved within the bank, not outside the bank. One of the byproduct benefits is if you've got a good wealth
proposition, you also attract the cash. You keep cash in the bank as well. They go hand in hand. And so, I think –
look, I think we're in a very different position today in offering wealth propositions to clients.
And what we've done is deliberately try to diversify the revenue stream. So, it's less dependent on purely
corporate banking and retail banking. And there is a continuum from retail and corporate banking into banking the
individuals and the entrepreneurs in their personal capacity and doing their wealth management in their personal
capacity.
And that's, I think, the exciting trend for the future. And I think that's where – why we believe that we're well
positioned to deliver mid-teens RoTE next year because we have that diversity and that continuum of offering. So,
I just want to say that's not a by chance strategy. That was a very deliberate strategy to keep both the cash in the
bank and the invested assets in the bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. That ends today's Q&A. So, I will now hand back to Noel for closing remarks.
