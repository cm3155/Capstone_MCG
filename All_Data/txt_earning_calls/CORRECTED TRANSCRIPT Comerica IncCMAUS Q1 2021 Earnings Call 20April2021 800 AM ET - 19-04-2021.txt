Curtis Chatman Farmer
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. The year is off to a good start. In the first quarter, we
generated earnings of $2.43 per share, a 59% increase over the fourth quarter, primarily driven by strong credit
quality. Our ROE grew to over 18% and our ROA was 1.68%.
I am pleased to report that we're hearing more optimism among our customers and colleagues across our
markets. Stimulus payments to individuals and enhanced unemployment benefits, along with PPP loans to small-
and medium-sized businesses have provided much needed relief to those that are struggling. Also, the
infrastructure bill that is being considered is expected to spread spending over many years.
This fiscal stimulus and the ramp up in the vaccine distribution, in combination with ample liquidity and low
borrowing costs, have the potential to spur substantial activity. The economic metrics are improving quickly and
the outlook for the back half of the year is for strong economic growth. As the economy continues to reopen and
pre-pandemic conditions return, many businesses are beginning to experience accelerating activity.
I remain very proud of the unwavering commitment of our team to serve our customers, communities, and each
other. We've again stepped up our efforts to support those affected by the pandemic. Last month, Comerica and
the Comerica Charitable Foundation pledged approximately $16 million to support small businesses and
communities impacted by COVID. This support is in addition to the $11 million committed in 2020.
As you know, last year we funded $3.9 billion in the first round of PPP loans. Also, so far this year, due to hard
work of colleagues across the Bank, we've further assisted businesses by funding close to $1 billion in the second
round of PPP. In addition, in the first quarter, we processed over $600 million in PPP loan repayments, mainly
through forgiveness.
Turning to our first quarter financial performance on slide 4. Compared to the fourth quarter, average loans
decreased with seasonally lower home purchase volumes impacting our Mortgage Banker business. Also, total
line utilization, across nearly all businesses, have remained low. However, our loan pipeline has continued to
grow. Average deposits increased over $1 billion to another all-time high as customers received additional
stimulus payments.
Net interest income was impacted by $17 million in lease residual adjustments in an expiring legacy portfolio.
Excluding this impact, pre-tax pre-provision net revenue increased 5% despite the shorter quarter and the decline
in loan volume. This increase in PPNR was due to continued robust fee-generating activity and our expense
discipline.
As far as credit, our conservative culture, diverse portfolio as well as deep expertise, has served us well. Strong
credit performance and an improvement in our economic forecast resulted in a negative provision of $182 million.
The credit reserve remains healthy at 1.59%. Net charge-offs were only 3 basis points. Through the cycles, our
net charge-offs have typically been at or below our peer group average, including during the past year as we
navigated the pandemic.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
With more confidence in the economic recovery and an estimated CET1 ratio of 11.09%, we plan to restart share
repurchases. In the second quarter, we expect to make significant strides towards our 10% target, giving careful
consideration to earnings generation as well as capital needs to fund future loan growth. Our ongoing goal is to
provide an attractive return to our shareholders, which includes a dividend that currently has a yield of about 4%.
And now, we'll turn the call over to Jim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 5, average loans decreased approximately $800
million. As Curt mentioned, the biggest driver was Mortgage Banker, which declined from its record high in the
fourth quarter due to lower purchase volumes. Energy decreased as higher oil prices are resulting in improved
cash flow and capital markets activity.
We had expected National Dealer loans would begin to rebound in the first quarter, however, supply chain issues,
most notably with computer chips, have stymied production. In addition, March auto sales were the second-
highest of all time for that month, further depleting inventory. Dealer loans were $1.5 billion below the first quarter
of 2020. We remain confident floor plan balances will eventually rebuild to historical levels.
Equity Funds Services was a bright spot, increasing over $200 million with strong fund formation. Total period-end
loans reflect the decreases of $900 million in Dealer and $700 million in Mortgage Banker. Line utilization for the
total portfolio declined to 47%. We feel good about the pipeline which now sits above pre-pandemic levels. It
increased in nearly every business line and loans in the last stage of the pipeline nearly doubled over the fourth
quarter. Ultimately, we would expect this to translate into loan growth.
As far as loan yields, there were $17 million in lease residual value adjustments, mostly on aircraft in an expiring
legacy portfolio. We've not done business in this segment for many years and no further adjustments are
expected. Excluding the 14 basis point impact from the residual adjustment, loan yields increased 3 basis points
with the benefit of accelerated fees from PPP forgiveness. Continued pricing actions, particularly adding rate
floors when possible as loans renew, offset the decline in LIBOR.
Average deposits increased 2% or $1.1 billion to a new record as shown on slide 6. Consumer deposits increased
nearly $1 billion, primarily due to seasonality and the additional stimulus received in January. Customers continue
to conserve and maintain excess cash balances. With strong deposit growth, our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased
to 69%. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits reached an all-time low of 8 basis points, a decrease of 3
basis points from the fourth quarter, and our total funding costs fell to only 9 basis points.
Slide 7 provides details on our securities portfolio. Period-end balances are up modestly as we recently began to
gradually deploy some of our excess liquidity by opportunistically increasing the size of the portfolio. Lower rates
on the replacement of about $1 billion in payments received during the quarter resulted in the yield on the portfolio
declining to 1.89%. Yields on repayments averaged approximately 235 basis points while recent reinvestments
have been in the low-180s. We expect to mostly offset the yield pressure on MBS in the near-term with a
modestly larger portfolio. However, maturing treasuries will likely be a slight headwind in the back half of the year
depending on the mix of MBS and treasuries we would likely replace them with, as well as market conditions.
Turning to slide 8, excluding the impact of the lease residual adjustment and two fewer days in the quarter, net
interest income was roughly stable and the net interest margin would have increased 2 basis points. As far as the
details, interest income on loans decreased $28 million and reduced the net interest margin by 8 basis points.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
This was primarily due to the $17 million of lease residual adjustments which had a 9 basis point impact on the
margin as well as two fewer days in the quarter which had a $7 million impact. Lower loan balances had a $5
million impact and were partially offset by a $3 million increase in fees related to PPP loans.
Other portfolio dynamics had a $2 million unfavorable impact and included lower LIBOR, partially offset by pricing
actions. Lower securities yields, as I outlined in the previous slide, had a $2 million or 1 basis point negative
impact, continued prudent management of deposit pricing added $3 million and 1 basis point to the margin and a
reduction in wholesale funding added $1 million and 1 basis point. Average balances of the Fed were relatively
steady and remained extraordinarily high at $12.5 billion. This continues to weigh heavily on the margin with a
gross impact of approximately 41 basis points.
Credit quality was strong and metrics are moving in the right direction as shown on slide 9. Net charge-offs were
only $3 million or 3 basis points. Nonperforming assets decreased $34 million, and at 64 basis points of total
loans, they are about only half of our 20-year average. Inflows to nonaccrual were also very low. Criticized loans
declined $366 million and comprised 5% of the total portfolio. Positive migration in the portfolio, combined with
growing confidence and improving economic forecast, resulted in a decrease in our allowance for credit losses. Of
note, both the social distancing related segments as well as the Energy portfolio have performed better than
expected. However, we continue to apply a more severe economic forecast to these areas. Our total reserve ratio
was very healthy at 1.59% or 1.72% excluding PPP loans and remains well above pre-pandemic levels.
Noninterest income increased $5 million as outlined on slide 10, sustaining the positive trend we've seen for the
past year. Derivative income increased $11 million as volumes remained robust, particularly for energy hedges,
combined with a $10 million benefit from a change in the credit valuation adjustment. Note that we have made a
change in reporting. We have combined foreign exchange and customer derivative income, which was previously
included in other noninterest income into a combined derivative income line item. Prior periods have been
adjusted to reflect this change.
Warrants and investment banking fees moved higher and we had smaller increases in fiduciary and deposit
service charges. Partly offsetting this, commercial lending fees decreased $6 million with a seasonal decline in
syndication activity. Deferred comp asset returns were $3 million, a $6 million decrease from the fourth quarter
and are offset in noninterest expenses. Note card fees remained elevated. They were over 20% higher than a
year ago due to government card and merchant activity spurred by the economic stimulus and changes in
customer behavior related to the COVID environment. All in all, another strong quarter for fee income.
Turning to expenses on slide 11 which decreased $18 million or 4%. Starting with salaries and benefits, which
were up $11 million due to seasonal factors, this increase was driven by annual stock compensation and payroll
taxes resetting. Providing a partial offset was a decrease in deferred comp as well as a reduction due to two fewer
days in the quarter and seasonally lower staff insurance costs. All other expenses decreased $29 million. As
discussed last quarter, strong investment performance in 2020 has resulted in an $8 million reduction in pension
costs which is included in other noninterest expense.
In addition, effective January 1, we adopted a change in the accounting method for our pension plan. Previous
quarters have been adjusted, specifically fourth quarter pension expense was reduced by $8 million. This change
also decreased AOCI and increased retained earnings at year-end by $104 million, which resulted in a 16-basis-
point increase to our CET1 ratio. Finally, we realized seasonal decreases in advertising and occupancy, lower
operating losses and FDIC expense, as well as smaller decreases in other categories. Our strong expense
discipline is assisting us in navigating this low rate environment as we invest for the future.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Our CET1 ratio increased to an estimated 11.09% as shown on slide 12. As always, our priority is to use our
capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive return to our shareholders. In this
regard, we have maintained a very competitive dividend yield. As far as share repurchases, we have a long track
record of actively managing our capital and returning excess capital to shareholders. With more confidence in the
path of the economic recovery, we plan to resume share repurchases in the second quarter. We expect to make
significant strides towards our CET1 target of 10%.
Slide 13 provides our outlook for the second quarter relative to the first quarter. In addition, we have provided
expected trends for the second half of the year relative to the second quarter outlook. In the second quarter,
excluding PPP loans, we expect loan volume to be stable. We expect growth in several lines of business led by
Middle Market as a result of increasing M&A as well as working capital and CapEx needs. However, this will be
offset by continuing headwinds in Mortgage Banker, National Dealer, and Energy.
In line with the MBA forecast, Mortgage Banker is expected to decline as refi volumes begin to cool with higher
rates. We expect National Dealer to continue to decrease as auto inventory levels are challenged by strong
demand combined with supply issues. Also, Energy loans are expected to remain on the current declining trend
as higher oil prices are driving improved cash flow and capital markets activity.
As far as PPP loans, it is difficult to predict. However, we believe loan forgiveness will pick up towards the end of
the second quarter and the bulk should be repaid by year end. Excluding PPP loan activity, we believe loans
should grow across nearly all business lines in the second half of the year. This is based on a robust pipeline and
expectations that the economy will continue to strengthen. We expect average deposits to remain strong with the
second quarter benefiting from the latest Federal stimulus. These record levels are expected to wane in the back
half of the year, as customers start to put cash to work.
As far as net interest income, the $17 million lease residual adjustment we took in the first quarter will not recur.
That aside, all other factors, including PPP, are expected to offset each other in the second quarter. For example,
headwinds from lower reinvestment yields on securities should be offset by a modestly larger portfolio. As we
move into the second half of the year, we expect pressure on securities yields and swap maturities to be roughly
offset by non-PPP loan growth. In addition, lower PPP loan volume and accelerated fees are expected to be a
headwind. Of course, PPP activity is difficult to predict and may result in variability. Credit quality is expected to
remain strong. Assuming the economy remains on the current path, we expect our allowance should move
towards pre-pandemic levels.
We expect noninterest income in the second quarter to benefit from higher card fees, driven by recent stimulus
payments as well as increased syndication fees following lower seasonal activity in the first quarter. Also, we
expect growth in fiduciary income reflecting annual tax-related activity and new business generation. This growth
is expected to be more than offset by a decline in derivatives and warrants income from elevated levels as well as
deferred comp, which is not assumed to repeat. As we progress through the year, we believe customer-driven fee
categories in general should grow with improving economic conditions. However, card fees are expected to be a
headwind as the benefit from growing merchant and corporate volumes could be more than offset by lower
government card activity due to the absence of further individual stimulus payments.
We expect expenses to be stable in the second quarter. Salary and benefit expenses are expected to decrease in
the second quarter with lower stock comp as well as lower payroll taxes, partly offset by annual merit and one
additional day. Offsetting this decrease, we expect a rise in outside processing tied to growth in card fees as well
as seasonally higher marketing and occupancy expenses. As far as the second half of the year, by maintaining
our focus on expenses, we expect to offset higher tax spend. In addition, we expect increases in certain line items

due to seasonality and revenue growth. Finally, as I indicated on the previous slide, we plan to restart share
repurchases in the second quarter.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Curtis Chatman Farmer
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. As I mentioned in the beginning of the call, we're off to a good start and we expect the economy
will continue to improve throughout this year. We believe firming manufacturing conditions, increasing business,
and consumer confidence, as well as pent-up demand will support strong economic growth.
It is hard to believe that just over a year ago, we drastically changed the ways in which we work and live. We've
demonstrated the resilience of our business model as we embraced our core values and rose to the occasion to
support our customers, communities, and each other. Our success is anchored by our ability to provide our
expertise and experience to build and solidify deep enduring relationships, particularly during challenging times.
I'm extremely proud of the work our team has done to ensure we continue to deliver the same high level of
service.
We are focused on delivering a more diversified and balanced revenue base with an emphasis on fee generation
and our progress is demonstrated in our results as noninterest income has increased in each of the past four
quarters. Our robust card platform is a great example. It's helped position us for the recent and likely ongoing
changes in customer behavior. Also, our fiduciary business is growing with strong collaboration between Wealth
Management, Commercial and Retail Bank divisions.
In February, we increased the breadth and scale of our Trust Alliance business through the acquisition of a small
group with expertise in this area. In addition, we are committed to maintaining our strong expense discipline. Our
technology investments are enhancing the customer and colleague experience, helping to attract and retain
customers, and improving colleague efficiency. Finally, our disciplined credit culture and strong capital base
continue to serve us well. These key strengths provide the foundation to continue to deliver long-term shareholder
value.
Thank you for your time and now we'll be happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION

Good morning, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, Curt. Thanks. Good morning. In terms of buybacks, good to hear that you're starting it sooner, rather than
later, are you able to quantify your buyback expectation in 2Q? And also, when do you expect that you might be
able to get back to that 10% CE Tier 1?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Well, good morning, Ken. Thanks for the question. We would not expect to get right back to 10% in the second
quarter. We're going to be monitoring the environment throughout the second quarter, and one of the things on
our mind is that we are looking at the potential for some pretty good loan growth in the second half of the year, if
not late in the second quarter. And so, it's important to us to make sure that we have a buffer above 10% just to
make sure that we can accommodate our customers and their needs and have the capital to support that growth.
So, we do expect to make significant strides towards that 10% level, but we don't want to thread the needle too
tightly there. We think it's important to leave some type of buffer there for potential loan growth that could pop up
late in the quarter or in the couple quarters following the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. So, it sounds like it's more of at least a 2022 event if you're going to keep the capital to support loan growth
at the back half. Okay. And are you – go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
We'll make that assessment as we move through 2021. Certainly, second quarter, we would expect to keep a
buffer, and as we go through the last two quarters, we'll make that determination as we go through 2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. And then, my other question, you mentioned that you are investing some of your excess liquidity into
securities. Is your view changing at all, and how much of those excess deposits stay on your balance sheet over
the long-term?

We do expect that some of those deposits will start to wane in the second half of the year in the long-term, but we
do feel pretty good about the liquidity position. We're not expecting the Fed to materially change from its
accommodative policy at this point. And so, we are comfortable taking measured steps to invest some excess
liquidity into securities. Well, that's again something we're going to monitor throughout the year. We want to avoid
making any real big moves, but we think it is prudent to go ahead and invest some of that excess liquidity and
then monitor in future quarters what's going on in the economy, with the Fed and make that assessment as we
move into the latter quarters of the year.

Terry McEvoy Q

Hi. Good morning. First question, your expectations are on growth in Middle Market lending. I know you said
pipelines are higher and I think there were some commentary on M&A, but could you just run through your
confidence behind that statement and any markets or industries that stand out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Terry, it's Peter. We feel pretty good on the outlook, particularly in the second half of the year, as Jim and Curt
mentioned. The second quarter will be interesting to see how it unfolds as the economy start to open up, and we
feel good about it in just about all of our markets, the major markets of Michigan, Texas, and California. The
pipeline looks pretty good, activity level looks good. What you just still aren't seeing is utilization. So, that's
probably the biggest challenge, but we do feel good on our outlook as we've mentioned and are encouraged
about the optimism that we hear from our customers, and their sort of renewed belief that things are turning, if you
will.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. And then, as a follow-up, there has been a lot of talk about businesses and individuals moving from
California to Texas. I'm just curious, what are your thoughts here? Is this a net neutral to Comerica or could you
see some outside growth on the Texas side?

Terry, I appreciate the question. I think it's a positive for us sort of either way. We've got great franchise in both
markets, and if anything, it gives us ability to really support our customers, because to the extent that they're
moving and we can help them with that process, I think that puts us at an advantage. So, from the conversations
we've had with customers, it's not an uncommon conversation to have that, about the move, and I think it puts us
in a real advantage to be able to support them either way.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Good morning. On the idea that dealer floor plan levels will take longer to return to their historical levels, can you
discuss how much of that you think is transitory? And more broadly, how are you thinking about the risk just in
general of dealers possibly running with less inventory than they had historically?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Bill, it's Peter again. Our dealer groups are doing really, really well in this environment interestingly enough. So,
they've got the challenges of inventory, getting cars, but they are performing really well. So, obviously, the
balances are lower that we see and we think that will come back. I mean there has been a lot of press about this
issue. Matter of fact, today, there's an article in the Journal about it, just the supply constraints, getting chips,
getting cars produced, and not just chips, it's lots of other supplies, raw materials in general I think are in short
supply.
So, all of that said, we think it's probably more like 2022 before dealer starts to see floor plan balances increased.
We were encouraged I think coming into 2021 that, that might happen sooner, but it's clearly not happening. The
supply constraints are still there. But in the meantime, we're growing our customer base, our dealers are
performing really well, and we continue to stay very committed to supporting that business.

That's very helpful. Thank you. And as a follow up, could you give a bit more color on how you're thinking about
the stickiness of the deposit growth that you guys have experienced? And then, if you could also discuss your
front book and back book pricing dynamics and how those look across both your securities and loan portfolios,
just how do new money yields compare to what's coming off?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Yeah. We are expecting a large portion of the excess liquidity to stick around for some time, which is why we
were comfortable investing some of that into the securities portfolio at the end of the quarter and we'll certainly
consider doing so in upcoming quarters. So much of the excess liquidity is going to be dependent upon what the
Federal Reserve does, what happens with economic activity. So, it's really hard to say where it's going to go. But I
do think it's fair to say that a pretty good portion of that excess liquidity is likely here to stay for some short- to
medium-term and we would expect some of it to be put to use in the back half of the year.
Regarding your securities question, for the remainder of this year, we do expect for the securities to continue to
roll off and pay off at rates that are higher than what we're putting on the books. So, we will have some continued
kind of reduction in the loan yield as each quarter progresses. But as you saw in the chart and on the slides, that
decrease in yield is getting smaller each quarter as those yields start to converge on each other, but we don't
expect for that crossover point to occur this year. So, we'll continue to monitor that and make the right
opportunistic purchases with the right structure. But we do think for the remainder of the year, we will continue to
see yields rolloff that are higher than what we're putting on.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Good morning. Thanks. In slide 18, you guys talk about go-forward considerations for the swap and bond
portfolio. I'm just wondering, with all of your interest rate sensitivity, how are you thinking about potentially adding
to that book and laddering in overtime vis-à-vis what you've mentioned and starting to do in the securities book
itself? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Ken. Yeah. It's interesting that you mentioned hedging as well as the securities book. In a sense,
we are hedging with securities right now and we feel like we're in the fortunate position and that we have an
alignment of two different objectives in a sense by using securities to hedge, we can reduce assets and sensitivity
right now moving some earnings into the current period while maintaining some upside still. But we think we can

do so in a way that efficiently uses the excess liquidity to buy securities that are yielding significantly more than
synthetic hedges would. Right now, the hedges would carry about 50 bps of positive carry. The securities we're
buying about 170 bps of positive carry. And frankly, we're a little agnostic as to what line item or geography we
achieve both that earnings accretion and the reduction in asset sensitivity. So, right now, we see a lot of
percentage in using excess liquidity on securities, and as that excess liquidity begins to wane, you may see us
start to transition to more synthetic approaches.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, got it. Thank you. And just a follow-up on the costs side, you've been pretty stable, some pluses and
minuses underneath the – with the payments cards and pension and whatnot, and you're talking about flattish
from here. Can you just talk about just the puts and takes about incremental expense – sorry, investment dollars
versus your points that you make about the other controls underneath, like is flat a good outlook as we even look
longer-term than just the next few quarters? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Ken. Certainly to be clear, we do expect to be flat in the second quarter, but I did mention that, even though
we hope to self-fund some of our technology expenses, we will expect to see the typical seasonal increases,
modest increases in the second half of the year. Also, we do think the economy is going to be in pretty good
shape in the second half of the year. And so, we want to make sure we're in a position to support that. So, there
will be some modest expense increase in the second half of the year as we support that growth.
Certainly, as an example, as cards starts to take off throughout the year with additional stimulus that's just coming
to the system, we'd expect outside processing to step in or step up and we do want to make sure we're there for
the customer. So, there will be some modest expense growth as we move through the latter two quarters of the
year. Beyond that, we'll have to assess 2022 as we move through this year.
As always, we've done a pretty good job in expenses, they're always very front of mind, and that's something that
we have a bit of a maniacal emphasis on in terms of making sure we're challenging every – we challenge every
expense. We don't think there are any big wholesale changes that we're going to make to our expense structure
at this point. But we do challenge expenses as we move through the year and we expect to maintain that very
modest – flat to modest expense growth as we move from year-to-year.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everybody. Good morning. I wanted to start – it's nice to hear that your customers are more
optimistic. I'm curious what are you hearing from your commercial customers in terms of what they plan to do with
all the deposits they're sitting on and do we need to see those get materially reduced before loan growth
resumes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Hey, Steve. It's Peter. I think the short answer to that is yes. I think that deposits need to come down some before
we start to see that utilization. I didn't feel as strongly about that maybe a quarter or two ago, but it certainly feels
like the amount of liquidity in the system is just excessive and sort of restricting the need to borrow money. Now
that said, I think that there will be a time where companies are going to be – they're going to want more cushion.
So, they're going to borrow money, but they're going to maintain deposits. So, I think there's a nice level that we
will get to. We hope it's – as we mentioned in the second half of the year as we maybe see some liquidity kind of
move through the system. So, I think it's a little bit to be determined on that, but it certainly feels like some
utilization of those deposits is going to be needed to really see the borrowing pick up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then, I know it's tough to provide a full year outlook this year as there are so many
moving parts. But in terms of loan growth, what's your best guess would full year loan growth looks like? I'm trying
to get a better sense of how you guys stack up versus your peers and there's quite a few pluses and minuses on
your outlook slide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Well, certainly – it's Jim, Steven, I'll take that first part of the question then Peter can add on. It's really been
a bit of a roller coaster year-to-year. So, it's very difficult to look at year-to-year comparisons. Each quarter has
had its own story, and certainly, we're going to see several billion dollars of PPP loans pay down as we move
through this year. So, I would probably look at it in the context of just the go-forward outlook, and as you heard
me say, we do expect them to be stable in the second quarter ex-PPP. We'll certainly be down in total due to PPP
loans being prepaid as we move through the second half of the year. But as we mentioned, we do expect solid
loan growth in the second half of the year with the ex-PPP portfolio. So, hopefully that helps, and Peter, anything
you'd add on to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
I think, Jim, you answered it. Steve, we've got some businesses that move – swing pretty big: Mortgage Banker,
Dealer, and Energy, we've talked about those. But when you look at the rest of our general businesses, I think
historically, we've grown pretty consistently with those economies and I think being in in the markets that we're in
gives us a real opportunity to grow with those economies as things come back.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. If I could squeeze one last one in, I just want to understand the commentary around spread.
I know it's tough to pinpoint NIM, right, just given all the liquidity we're talking about. But if we look at the net
interest spread of 2.20% in the quarter, is the message you're giving to us today is that you expect the spread to
continue to decline through 2021?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Steven, I'm so hesitant to talk about NIM, because we are so volatile on our deposits. I really like to look at it in
terms of net interest income, since the cash of the Fed really has no capital-consuming characteristics. So, we do
expect net interest income to be somewhat stable ex-PPP. We will see a little bit of decrease as we move late into
2021 just due to the fact that once you lose several billion dollars of PPP loans that are yielding around 2%, that's
– it's unavoidable that that's going to have some negative impact on net interest income and that's very hard to
make up. So, I would say relatively stable ex-PPP, and then PPP will put some downward pressure late in the
year. And hopefully, as the economy picks up, you start to replace those PPP loans with real traditional loans and
customers start investing for the future.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Just wanted to circle back on your rate sensitivity given the expectations here
eventually around rate hikes. Can you review your hedging profile, particularly the floors that you have in place or
may not have in place, just to give us a sense of at the point when rates finally lift on the short end, how quickly
do you accrue that benefit?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Yeah, Brock. It's Jim, happy to take that question. Even though we have invested in securities over the last two or
three quarters, fixed-rate securities, we do continue to be very asset sensitive. That's why one of the reasons
we're comfortable making those investments in longer duration securities. You'll see in slide 18 that we're actually
showing more asset sensitivity than we had traditionally. You see the 100 bps linear, nonparallel shift in rates
would produce $156 million of income. That's higher than we would typically see and one of the reasons for that is
all of the excess cash that we have on deposit at the Fed.
Now, as the economy continues to progress, expect two things to happen in coordination with each other. You
would expect to see rates rise, which is the genesis of your question, but typically that would be accompanied by
improving economic conditions, which would probably result in either the Fed drying up some of that liquidity or
customers putting that cash to use. So, I would expect to see that $156 million sensitivity marker that you see on
page 18 start to come down a little bit as we invest in more securities and as excess cash comes down to the
Fed, but having said that, there is no doubt that we are going to benefit significantly if rates do go up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And just to put a finer point on that, some of your peers are quick to call out caveats that the benefit
wouldn't immediately accrue. It sounds like this is a different situation here where the benefit is pretty direct drive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Well, the benefit would certainly immediately accrue if rates went up, there is – and probably more so for
Comerica than peer banks just given the very significant asset-sensitive book we have and the LIBOR-based
characteristics we have. Now, we do have significant loan floors in place and they're giving a significant lift. But
even with that, we maintain quite a bit of asset sensitivity, so we would certainly benefit right away.

Gary Peter Tenner Q

quarter forgiveness?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Gary. The PPPs to be recognized, it remains to be seen how much were recognized through typical
amortization. The longer these loans stay on the books, the more we're going to see amortized through time.
Obviously, the quicker they're forgiven, the more we get accelerated fees likely all one-time. Currently, in terms of
fees outstanding, we have between the two rounds about $76 million of fees on the book right now. In terms of
how that might play out, we're going to recognize a fair amount of that. Throughout this year, it's just amortization
as part of that 2% that we're getting on PPP loans. We'll get, obviously, some of it next year for those loans that
stay on the book. But just to give you a feel for how this year might progress and what you might see in terms of
earnings impact, the accelerated fees, if you look at those just in a vacuum, we had about $12 million of
accelerated fees in Q1 and that's compared to $5 million in Q4 of 2020.
So, we did have a $7 million increase. It's very unpredictable as to how this might play out. But in some of the
guidance that we've offered you in the script, we would expect that $12 million of accelerated fees to be
somewhat stabled in the second quarter. We would expect it to be higher in the third quarter, it could be 50%
higher, it could be double, remains to be seen. And then, we would see it kind of come back to the first and
second quarter level in the fourth quarter. So, those are the types of blips you might see in our net interest income
quarter to quarter related to accelerated PPP fees. Now, if you take that and you adjoin it to some gradual
rundown of the loans that are on the books right now, essentially the $3.5 billion that are on the books and you
assume that runs down at its typical 2% rate, you put those together and it gives you a feel for what PPP is going
to do to net interest income as we move from quarter to quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Great. I appreciate the color. Just to be clear though, I thought in your prepared remarks you've noted that you
expected the bulk I think you said of PPP loans to be forgiven by the end of this year. So, most of those fee
should be recognized as revenue this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
That's right. We would expect 5% to 10%, 5% to 15% to be on the book still at year-end, that remains to be seen,
but the vast majority should be gone by the end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Thanks. Good morning. Peter, maybe a question for you, you've talked about the increasing pipeline. Can you talk
about the magnitude of that change in the pipelines and maybe how different it was than a quarter ago?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Jon. Sure. So, a quarter ago, we were sort of using back to pre-pandemic levels. I think the language that
you're sort of hearing now is that it's above pre-pandemic levels. So, we feel like the pipeline is about as good as I
can really frankly remember of being in this role for the last few years, and so it's encouraging. I would say it has
exceeded sort of where we thought we would be at this point. Now, again, seeing all that come to fruition, we still
got a lot of work to do, but it certainly feels like we have gone above pre-pandemic levels versus last quarter. I
think I was kind of using terminology of being at back to pre-pandemic levels. That gives you an idea of it, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. And then, maybe to tie that into the deposit question we keep asking, but you're talking about
deposits beginning to wane as customers put cash to use and I think all we see from a high level is just the big
deposit growth. Are you seeing evidence, maybe early evidence of some clients starting to do that, starting to take
their cash balances down for business activity or is that just not the case yet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Jon, I would say little evidence, circumstantial maybe even. So, I can't say that we're seeing hard evidence of that
occurring just yet. Now, again, we feel like the activity will lead to that sort of use of cash, but I can't say that we're
seeing a whole lot of hard evidence that that is occurring.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then maybe one, Melinda, on the reserves and talking about eventually heading back to the pre-
pandemic levels, is this – is the message here it's a glide path to pre-pandemic levels or is the message that if the
economy continues to mend, we're going to – we could get another acute – more acute step down in the reserve
levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thanks for the question. Yes. I think that, obviously, given the performance of the portfolio which has been – it
really exceeded our expectations and is far better than what I think anybody could have expected kind of coming
into the pandemic, assuming that there is no negative migration, which again, we don't see anything in the
portfolio right now that would lead us to believe that, and that the economic forecast remains positive to
improving, we're going to continue to see reserves come down close to that or around that pre-pandemic level. I
mean CECL is a very complex accounting exercise, so it's very difficult to peg a percentage or a number that it's
going to get to, but we feel very, very confident that we'll be moving in the direction of pre-pandemic levels
throughout the remainder of this year.

way you think about it?
