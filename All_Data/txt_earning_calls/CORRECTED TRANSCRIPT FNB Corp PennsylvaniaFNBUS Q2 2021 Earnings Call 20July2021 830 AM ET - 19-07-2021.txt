Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, and welcome to our earnings call.
Joining me today are Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer; and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer.
First, I will provide a short review of the second quarter financial results, then I'll cover recent performance trends
of our key business model before turning the call over to Gary and Vince for their remarks. Lastly, I'll wrap up the
call by discussing the key considerations of last week's merger announcement with Howard Bancorp, Inc.
FNB's second quarter earnings per share totaled $0.31 representing an 11% increase on a linked quarter basis,
operating net income reached a record $101 million and total revenue increased to $308 million. Our performance
resulted in a return on tangible common equity of 16% and growth in tangible book value per share to $8.20, an
increase of $0.19 or 2%. The quarter's efficiency ratio of 56.8% improved due to the benefit of increased revenue
and continued expense discipline as we achieved the 2021 operating cost saving flow of $20 million.
Our company remains well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.02% for the second quarter. Second
quarter revenue was supported by record wealth management revenues and strong contributions across a
number of segments including insurance, mortgage banking, capital markets, and SBA lending. Many of these
areas have continued to benefit from our expansion into higher growth markets. On a year-to-date basis, wealth
management revenues increased over $6 million as total wealth management and insurance revenues increased
26% and 8%, respectively.
Looking at the balance sheet on an annualized linked quarter basis, FNB demonstrated strong fundamental
performance as we saw a hiccup in lending activity that translated into significant spot loan growth of 9% when
excluding the impact of PPP loans. On a spot basis, total deposits were flat with seasonal outflows and a decline
in time deposit balance. Non-interest-bearing deposits grew to $10.2 billion at June 30 and now comprise a third
of total deposits. This brings our loan-to-deposit ratio to 82.4% providing FNB with ample liquidity and a favorable
funding mix moving forward.
Diving deeper into the wholesale bank's performance this quarter, we are encouraged that the commercial loan
activity has begun to pick up across the footprint and pipelines are healthy entering the second half of the year.
We have significant opportunities within the commercial pipelines in the Carolinas, Pittsburgh, and Mid-Atlantic
markets which reached the highest level in the last two years. Additionally, strength in the total near-term pipeline
give us optimism for a strong second half for commercial loan origination.
Consistent with our comments on the April call, activity levels around commercial platforms as well as consumers
are encouraging, given our goal to reach mid-single-digit loan growth on a spot basis by the end of the year.
However, I'll note that commercial line utilization rates remain well below historical levels. We are optimistic that
utilization rates could move higher in the second half of this year, as remaining PPP loans are processed through

the forgiveness period and the US economy begins to accelerate as the supply chain for many industries
improves.
As we discussed on the prior call, our mortgage banking business continues to see near-record production
volumes. However, gain-on-sale margins contracted across the industry during the quarter reflecting the current
market condition.
In addition to mortgage banking, the overall consumer pipelines have grown significantly since the beginning of
the year. We've begun to experience lending growth across the consumer product set. As economic activity has
begun to pick up, we were experiencing increased loan demand in commercial and consumer banking and
favorable credit trends.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary, so he can provide additional detail on asset quality. Gary?

Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vincent. Good morning, everyone.
Our results for the second quarter were favorable and we are very pleased with our credit portfolio's position
moving into the second half of the year. Delinquency and non-performing levels decreased meaningfully during
the quarter and our net losses remained below. Positive momentum of the broader economy and continued
reopening of businesses have further contributed to the favorable results for the quarter, particularly as some
borrowers in the more sensitive industries and asset classes begin to show signs of recovery. I'll cover that in
greater detail later in my remarks. But first, let's walk through our credit results for the second quarter and review
some of those highlights.
The level of delinquency excluding PPP balances ended June at 80 bps, a 9 basis point improvement linked
quarter which was driven by broad improvements across all portfolios, notably commercial and one-to-four family.
The level of NPLs and OREO also improved to end the quarter at 58 basis points representing a 14 basis point
decrease from the prior quarter's ex-PPP level. Our NPLs decreased meaningfully, down nearly $30 million during
the quarter, which was driven primarily by a $21 million reduction in the commercial portfolio, including the
resolution of a credit that was previously reserved for.
Net charge-offs for the quarter were very low at $3.8 million or 6 basis points annualized, while year-to-date net
charge-offs remained at a very solid 9 bps annualized. Non-GAAP net charge-offs excluding PPP balances were
7 bps and 10 bps for the quarter and year, respectively.
We recognized a $1.1 million net benefit in provision this quarter following broadly improving economic activity
and positive credit quality results through June, resulting in a stable reserve position at 1.42%, while the ex-PPP
reserve stands at 1.51%. NPL coverage also remains very favorable at 278% due to reduced NPL levels during
the quarter. Our total ending reserve position, inclusive of acquired unamortized discounts, totals 1.58%.
I'd now like to provide some additional color on our loan portfolio and give an overview of our approach to
underwriting and managing risk as lending markets remain highly competitive.
Touching quickly on loan deferrals, we ended June at a level of 0.7% of our core loan portfolio, with these levels
continuing to decline as new requests have essentially ceased and borrowers returned to contractual payment
schedules.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Our banking teams have also remained actively engaged with our commercial customers to stay apprised of how
the broader economy and emerging trends are affecting their operations, including the impact of supply chain
disruptions, labor shortages, and the general future outlook for their respective industries. These factors are all
taken into careful consideration during our underwriting and credit approval processes, which is consistent with
our overall credit philosophy.
We were successful in closing a number of high-quality lending opportunities in the quarter with strong borrowers
that fit within our desired credit profile, and we will continue to approach transactions in this manner to help us
meet our growth targets while maintaining our desired risk profile.
In closing, we had a successful quarter marked by solid credit results and loan losses, which has us favorably
positioned moving into the second half of the year. We've made significant progress working down rated credits
as indicated by a 15% reduction in classifieds, reflecting the tireless efforts put forth by our workout teams to
reduce exposure to more sensitive industries and take risk off the table as economic conditions continue to
improve.
As we look ahead to new lending opportunities, our core credit principles that have served us well throughout
economic cycles remain front and center in all credit decisions we make, including consistent and disciplined
underwriting across the footprint, attentive and timely management of risk, and proactive portfolio management to
further position us for the quarters ahead.
I'll now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Today I will discuss our financial results and current expectations.
As noted on slide 5, first (sic) [second] (00:11:27) quarter EPS increased to $0.31, up significantly from the prior
and year-ago quarters. Looking at highlights for the quarter, on an operating basis, net income available to
common stockholders increased $18.3 million or 22% to a record $101.5 million as total revenue increased $2.1
million or 0.7%.
Operating expenses were well-controlled, down $5 million linked quarter. We saw a negative provision for credit
losses due to the improved credit metrics that Gary just discussed. The linked quarter growth in operating PPNR
of $7 million or 6% reflects the company's strong performance in the quarter even without provision benefit.
Now turning to slide 7 to review the balance sheet, period-end loan balances excluding PPP increased $515
million or 9.1% annualized on a linked quarter basis through organic growth with strong contributions from both
the commercial and consumer segments, as the economy continues to rebound. On an average balance basis,
total loans decreased $56 million, reflecting accelerated PPP forgiveness during the second quarter.
On the deposit side, average deposits increased $1.1 billion or 3.9% to over $30 billion, a record high, with non-
interest bearing deposits comprising 33% of total deposits. On a spot basis, deposits were relatively flat, given the
managed, defined and higher-cost time deposits.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Focusing on slide 8, net interest income increased $5 million to $227.9 million, as the PPP contribution increased
$2.2 million to $25 million, which was offset by a $1.9 million decreased contribution from purchase accounting
accretion to $5.0 million.
The underlying net interest income trends improved due to a more favorable balance sheet mix, and our
continued focus on reducing deposit costs in the lower interest rate environment was evidenced by our total cost
of interest-bearing deposits declining 7 basis points to 24 basis points. Reported net interest margin decreased 5
basis points to 2.70%, as earning asset yields declined 9 basis points which is partially offset by the 6 basis point
reduction in the cost of funds.
The yield on total loans and leases remained stable at 3.51%. But excluding the higher cash balances, purchase
accounting accretion and PPP impacts, the underlying net interest margin would be 2.71%, representing a 1 basis
point increase compared to the first quarter 2021 and the second quarter in a row of improving underlying net
interest margin.
Let's now look at non-interest income and expense on slide 9 and slide 10. Non-interest income totaled $80
million, decreasing $3 million from record levels last quarter. We achieved record wealth management revenue of
$15 million through contributions across the geographic footprint and positive market impact on assets under
management. SBA volume and average size of transactions increased during the quarter driving SBA premium
revenues to $2.6 million, almost double the prior quarter. Pipelines in this business remain solid. We'd expect
near-term SBA premium revenues to be strong.
Mortgage banking operations income decreased $8.3 million as gain-on-sale margins tightened meaningfully in
the second quarter 2021 throughout the industry, held-for-sale pipeline declined from significantly elevated levels
and the benefit from mortgage servicing rights impairment valuation recovery was $2.2 million lower than last
quarter.
Non-interest expense decreased $2.4 million linked quarter on a reported basis. But excluding $2.6 million of
branch consolidation costs in the quarter, non-interest expense decreased $5 million or 2.7%. On an operating
basis, salaries and employee benefits decreased $5.3 million or 4.9% primarily related to the timing of normal
annual long-term stock awards recognized in the first quarter each year. Outside services expenses increased
$1.8 million reflecting increases from third-party technology providers, legal costs and other consulting
engagements.
We are very pleased with this quarter's results with record operating net income, accelerating sequential loan
growth, strong revenue growth, solid credit quality metrics and continued growth in tangible book value per share
increasing $0.19 per share to $8.20.
Now, turning to our outlook for the third quarter 2021, excluding PPP contribution, we would expect net interest
income to be up slightly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. The level of PPP contribution will be
a direct function of the amount of forgiveness processed during the quarter. Our current thinking is that we will
see around $500 million of forgiveness in the third quarter, which would translate into a $79 million reduction in
net interest income contribution from PPP loans. However, if the SBA approves forgiveness closer to second
quarter levels, the reduction in PPP contribution would be smaller.
We expect non-interest income to be in the high $70 million area, given the diversified nature of our non-interest
income revenue streams. We expect non-interest expense to be flattish compared to operating expenses in the

second quarter. Our provision for loan losses remains dependent on the level of loan origination activity and we
are encouraged by the favorable credit trends observed during the first half of 2021.
Regarding our full year assumptions, our loan growth, total revenue and non-interest expense assumptions
remain unchanged with current deposit growth reflecting the benefit of additional government stimulus as we
continue to see increased liquidity and a loan-to-deposit ratio below historical levels.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Vince.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Vince.
I'd like to provide an update on the pending Howard acquisition. We were excited to begin the integration process
with the Howard team, and we are confident that our established leadership in the Mid-Atlantic market will work
well with the talented bankers at Howard. We share a deep culture of client and community service which should
allow for a seamless transition in the coming months for all of our stakeholders. We also expect the conversion
and integration to run smoothly as both organizations operate on a common core system.
As discussed previously, our decision to selectively enter higher-growth markets through a combination of de
novo location, loan production offices, and strategic acquisitions has FNB well positioned today. With the Howard
merger, we will grow to the number six deposit share in the Baltimore MSA, while adding meaningful customer
density to the Mid-Atlantic region which covers Maryland, Washington D.C., and Northern Virginia.
Our long-term strategy is to best position our company in the markets where we have the ability to grow loans,
low-cost deposits, and fee income organically through increasing our market share over the long term and
expanding the universe of clients and prospects. If you look at our market expansion strategy in the Mid-Atlantic,
our four acquisitions since 2013 came at a lower relative acquisition cost with the weighted average price to
tangible book of 1.5 times.
Our growth strategy in the Mid-Atlantic region provided access to a population of 10 million and more than
300,000 businesses with revenue greater than 100,000. Since the end of 2015, our compounded annual organic
loan growth for FNB in Maryland was 15%. Furthermore, as a company overall, we have nearly doubled our
annual non-interest income since 2015 from $162 million to $294 million, most of which has to do with our
investment in products and services, but also bringing those capabilities into our expansion markets and
broadening our client relationships. Therefore, we are very excited about our long-term potential for growth as we
offer our deep product suite to Howard's customer base.
Looking specifically at some of the transaction highlights, the Howard franchise increases FNB's Baltimore
deposits by $1.7 billion to $3.5 billion on a pro forma basis, while creating a combined organization of more than
$41 billion in total assets. Additionally, the transaction carries lower execution risk, given the end market
synergies. We view the transaction as financially attractive with a 4% EPS accretion with fully phased-in cost
savings and enhanced pro forma profitability metrics which include a 200 basis point improvement in the
efficiency ratio and an internal rate of return greater than 25%. Consistent with our approach to capital
management, the transaction is expected to be neutral to CET1 at close and includes minimal tangible book value
dilution of 2%. As I noted earlier, our TBV growth this quarter alone was 2%, essentially earning the TBV dilution
back in one quarter.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Our M&A strategy hasn't changed from what we've said the last couple of quarters. First and foremost, our focus
is on organic growth. But if opportunities arise where the targeted end market has potential for significant cost
saves and carries low execution risk with minimal tangible book value dilution, the potential acquisition becomes
worthy of evaluation.
We are excited about the opportunities in front of us, as our organization continues to flourish and evolve as a
more diversified financial institution. Last month, we are honored to be named as a top workplace in Northeast
Ohio for the seventh consecutive year and our 30th workplace recognition overall, which are based solely on
employee feedback.
In closing, we are focused on continuing our commitment to advance our market position by gaining scale and
operational efficiency and by cultivating a great culture and meaningful lasting relationships with our clients and
communities, while simultaneously creating value for our shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?

Just on loan growth, just want to make sure I understand the mid-single-digit growth expectations or guide for
2021. Does that assume, Vince, that loan utilization rates remain at the low levels they are now and then there
could be upside, if that moves higher, is that the messaging?

Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then secondly, on the other side of the coin, I think I worry about a little bit as I know you guys have
always had such a strong credit function, there's so much liquidity out there presumably chasing loans that I
would imagine companies – banks could get more aggressive on pricing terms – and pricing and terms and good

banks could find themselves on the sidelines to some degree. So just wondered if you're seeing evidence of that
in the marketplace in terms of tighter pricing, tighter terms and just your general thoughts there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Frank, I'll try to tackle the initial response and then I'll turn it over to Gary because he sees elaborately the trends
relative to credit and pricing more than I do. But I can tell you, we have 10 regions, if you look at the breakdown of
the growth by regions, Pittsburgh has a huge portfolio. They were up about 3%. Our capital region, which is
Harrisburg, Scranton, Lancaster, Reading, they were up just almost 5%. South Carolina, which is Charleston
principally, they were up 15%. Raleigh was up approximately 4%. That was pretty decent-sized portfolio. And then
we saw some growth in builder finance and in our SBA portfolio.
So I think that we have enough granularity and that was the strategy from day one was to not be dependent on a
single geography where adverse selection kicks in and market trends move in the wrong direction, we end up
booking assets that come back to haunt us. As you know from your long history with this company, we are very
conservative. Many of the moves that we made leading into the current situation, we were very proactive and
discarding what we considered to be risky asset classes because we thought we were in the late turn of the cycle
even before the pandemic.
So I think we're very well positioned from a credit perspective. I think we're proven. We don't have to make any
bones about it. We performed exceptionally well. In fact, I would argue that without stimulus, many of our peers
might have had more substantial credit problems because of concentration in certain industries, which we don't
have.
So I think that given everything that we've designed within our company, it's all working pretty well. And I would
suspect that those pipelines, it's going to vary from market to market. Some markets are irrational and we're going
to back away. But we can lean in in other areas to pick up the slack.
Go ahead, Gary. I'll let you talk about the trends, what you're seeing there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, Frank. In terms of the competitive nature of it, it surely is that we're going to pick our spots with our clients
and we'll compete from a pricing standpoint as we have. We've seen during the quarter some great high-quality
opportunities with some really strong clients, as I mentioned in my remarks. We're seeing more and more of those
opportunities. There's some M&A activity going on and we'll continue to play in that space and pick our spots.
The other thing we are seeing is it's a very good time to get rid of some assets that we don't want on the balance
sheet for the long term. Banks are very aggressive in that space right now and it's one of the reasons why we
were able to upgrade some credits and, more importantly, get rid of some of those credits that we didn't want
during the quarter which helped that classified number come down significantly. We do also expect that to
continue as we roll into Q3. So hopefully, we get some additional benefit there, but we'll be opportunistic to pick
our spots, take care of our clients as we do each and every day.

Okay. Great. And then one last one, if I could, just in terms of M&A, certainly Howard does fit the bill of what
you've been talking about for the last few quarters, Vince, in terms of the potential strategy or what you look for, if
– in a partner. Just wondering, I guess maybe you never say never, but just wondering your thoughts on, could
you see something more expansionary larger on the M&A side, or is that kind of largely off the table for you guys
just given what you're able to do on the organic side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I think we're still focusing on organic growth. Opportunistically, there may be opportunities that come up, but we're
going to be keenly focused on tangible book value dilution as a governor. So that's kind of rules out certain
transactions, right? Unless we could get substantial cost take-out and it fits strategically and is active to our
organic growth strategy, I would rule it out. If it works within our strategy and I said it pretty clearly I thought in the
prepared comments, we're going to look for those metrics that drive returns for the shareholders and fits into our
strategy which I think we've executed extraordinarily well. I reflect back to 2017, I don't think there has been a
quarter where we've missed what our forecasting has been.
So I think our employees have done an exceptional job integrating those companies. We've done a phenomenal
job rolling non-interest income. I mentioned that on the call. It's more than doubled, almost all organic. And again,
it's the execution of our strategy against the market expansion and the accumulation of companies that we've
brought on through our acquisitions and through organic growth. So that continues to bode well for us. And I think
we've got a lot of work to do. On the digital front, we continue to improve our interface and we continue to drive
activity from a technology perspective. And that's very exciting.
So I think when you look at all of that, that's pretty much our M&A strategy. I think I've reinforced it in the script
and hopefully that's clear enough for everybody.

Couple of questions from me, just on the unchanged revenue guide, I think approximately $1.2 billion for the full
year. It seems like you guys are tracking a little ahead of that to start to the first six months here, and I'm just
curious, outside of what's likely some conservatism around PPP forgiveness I imagine in terms of the timing of
when that recognizes, is there anything else in the back half of the year that we should be mindful of from a
revenue perspective like, for example, the recent wealth production has been strong, is there some likes for
normalization there or anything else that could potentially kind of slow the trajectory you're on from a revenue
standpoint in the back half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I think we're being conservative because we're in uncharted territory here. I mean, I want to be optimistic.
I'm an optimistic person. You guys have accused me of that many times. I try to stay positive. But I also know that
there's quite a few unknowns out there. The changes that have gone on with the pandemic, it really turns some
things upside down. So I think, can we achieve greater loan growth than increased in outstanding balances in the
loan portfolio, absolutely. But the supply chain needs to be correct, as there are a number of issues particularly in
the C&I segment with companies that can't meet full production quotas because they can't get supplies. There're
commodity price increases that haven't been reflected and revolver balances because they can't get the product
or they're unwilling to take the risk on price volatility in the current market.
So there's quite a few unknowns out there. Inflation, what will inflation do? When you look at the mortgage
business, gain-on-sale margins came in fairly substantially. We signaled that on the last call. Somebody had
asked and we had indicated that we saw that they were coming in and they've been varying. So there is some
volatility in the pricing there too because of the changes in the 10-year interest rate in particular. So there's quite a
bit out there that makes it difficult to forecast.
Having said all of that, I think the activity has picked up. The pipelines are up substantially. It's the best pipeline
we've had in consumer, small business and middle market banking in a number of years. And I'm hopeful that we
can execute and turn that around.
When you look at non-interest income, I think one of the benefits of having such a diverse base of fee-based
businesses is when one is up – when one is down, the other one is up. So SBA is really up fairly significantly.
Wealth had a big leap because of some organic growth that we experienced and improvement in that asset
values because of market condition. That all offsets the mortgage declines.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
So I think, we – and I can tell you from a capital markets perspective, we probably would have been a little more
conservative looking into the future. But I think with the 10-year at about $1.18 right now, there's now an
opportunity for people to continue to fix the rate to derivatives fee income looks like it's still hanging in there pretty
solidly. We've got some great syndications opportunities. In our debt capital markets platform that we launched,
we've already seen three or four deals that we've participated in. So that's all exciting. But, again, it's very difficult
to forecast in this environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. No, that makes sense. Appreciate the color. Maybe a question on the kind of the liquidity position and the
margin from here, I mean you guys continue to grow deposits which I imagine is a good indicator of kind of overall
customer growth in this quarter particularly, but with a lot of the stimulus playing out over the last two quarters.
But just curious how you guys are thinking about the cash position, pace of deployment in the bond book and/or
conversely, sitting heavier in cash and hoping that the loan growth kind of materializes and maybe there's some
normalization in deposits, if the economy continues to recover. Just any thoughts there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say that on the investment portfolio side, I mean our plan from here is basically to reinvest the cash
flows coming off the portfolio. We're not looking to increase the size of it. I mean during the second quarter, we
opportunistically reinvested 110% of the cash flow, so we grew the portfolio a little bit. There were some
opportunities in April and late June. Our plan from here for the rest of the year would just be to reinvest about
$125 million to $150 million a month kind of if that's working. The reinvestment rates, in the second quarter, they
were 1.21. Rates went down today, they were down to 1, 1.10 and could even go sub-1. So we'll pause when it
doesn't make sense to do that. So, the investment strategy is pretty much intact.
And then the level of cash on the balance sheet that we have, the main focus there is going to be to deploy that in
loan origination, fund the loan growth in the second half of the year, and as Vince said there's a lot of
opportunities there throughout the markets. And then there is opportunity to use some of the cash to – once we
closed the transaction, there's some borrowings in some deposit classes that will make sense to kind of use some
of our cash there too. So that's kind of the high level plan as far as the cash position.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Helpful. And then just one last question from me just regarding Howard. Appreciate the additional color.
Looking at Howard's recent results, it seemed like over the last quarter or two particularly they had started to
really show some good organic growth despite everything going on, and after some initial slowdown after their
transaction they had with 1st Mariner. I was just curious, I mean, I imagine that's just kind of a critical piece of this
for you guys as you mentioned kind of be additive to your Baltimore growth. I'm just curious if you have any color
you can provide on kind of the retention of that lending team and how you kind of expect them to fit into your
already growing operation in the Greater Baltimore region?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
That's a great question and I'm happy to answer it. I think when we first set out to do due diligence on Howard, we
didn't know what we would find. And as we dug deeper into the information, we became extremely confident with
the quality of the people and the quality of the portfolio. And I think this is one of the lowest credit marks we've

had. And believe me, Gary and his team do a fairly extensive job, Tom Fisher, Gary, the whole team, evaluating
risk within those targets. We're very seasoned in doing acquisitions, and many of us have been here for a number
of years. I've personally been here for I think 15 years or 17 years, [indiscernible] (00:37:30) remember. But
there's a quite a bit of due diligence that goes on.
We were very impressed with the people, with the culture, with Mary Ann's leadership. I know the company has
struggled a little bit, but when you look at the opportunity for us just in the DDA accounts, we had 40,000
customers in the Baltimore market. With our data analytics teams, with our digital strategy on the consumer side,
that provides substantial benefit.
If you look at the opportunities from a mortgage lending perspective in the market, it's been a big contributor for
our success, the Mid-Atlantic region in total. They are in mortgage banking, that provides us with a tremendous
amount of opportunity in the consumer segment relative to mortgage banking.
If you look at commercial banking, their legal lending limit was relatively small, while they have a really, we think,
a pretty solid customer base. They don't offer derivatives. They don't offer international banking. They don't offer
as many Treasury management services as we offer. So there's a substantial opportunity which, by the way, this
has not all been modeled. We think over time, just like we did with the rest of the company with non-interest
income growth, we have an opportunity with that portfolio and Gary, I don't know if you want to talk about the
credit due diligence...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
...and how we evaluated the opportunity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. The due diligence work that the team does and as Vince mentioned, it's a deep team. The group has done
many of these transactions. We totally re-underwrote 80% of the commercial loan book at Howard and it checked
out very, very nicely. Vince mentioned the credit mark at 1.7%. We also reviewed 20% of the retail book with the
underwriting there evidence of lower-risk underwriting. So felt very comfortable really across the books. The
philosophy around the commercial underwriting was very similar to ours. So again, a lot of good work done there,
felt very comfortable with the credit mark and the work that the team has done at Howard. So we feel it's a very
good match from a cultural standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And we also, from a leadership perspective, we have strong leadership in Baltimore. Baltimore has been a
double-digit performer for us from an organic perspective. We've grown 15% per year since 2013 there. So we
have a very strong team. They have very good people. I'd say our focus is probably a little bit further up market.
Their focus is middle market and small business. It fits in very well for us. So there's plenty of opportunities for
their bankers to join our team and benefit.

Plus, we are keeping the credit officer, so he will be one of the senior credit officers in the marketplace because of
Gary's confidence. The management team will be there tomorrow, so we will have a meeting with the bankers
tomorrow and we're very excited about that. And I think that we'll be able to convey some of the things we've said
today to those individuals. And I think they'll be excited about the opportunities for them to cross-sell additional
products and services and to serve their clients.
I don't remember if you've asked me anything else, but I will tell you that we're very excited about the opportunity
to double our deposit share in Baltimore. There are a number of large players there. At number six deposit share
with $3.5 billion, I think we nearly doubled number 7, and then moves up fairly dramatically from there. So having
that additional scale in Baltimore and the Mid-Atlantic region is critically important. So look what it did for us in
Pittsburgh. It substantially accelerated our ability to go after middle market opportunities and grow organically in
Pittsburgh. And I think the same will happen there.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe the first question on mortgage production and then looking at whether or not you're putting those
mortgages on the portfolio versus selling them. Given the current trends, should the expectation be that more of
the mortgages end up on balance sheet? And I guess what would that do for mortgage banking outlook going
forward and what would need to happen to really get mortgage banking revenues higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say, I guess, a few things. So just a comment on the activity in the quarter as we mentioned in our
remarks, I mean, we had a significant decline in the gain-on-sale margins of over 100 basis points during the
quarter. Mortgage rates declined 35 basis points in the second quarter after a steep run up in the first. So that's a
big driver to the change from the first to the second quarter. And then the amount of the saleable pipeline dropped
about 13%. So that's helpful feedback. And then our MSR valuation reserve recovery, we had $2.5 million in the
15


F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
(FNB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
first quarter of positive recovery, then we had $0.3 million in the second quarter. So those are kind of the three
kind of key variables there.
From a sole production standpoint, we actually sold more quarter over quarter, second quarter versus first
quarter, and we're really selling the – to folks the loans that – all loans that are saleable, the jumbo loans we tend
to keep on balance sheet [indiscernible] (00:44:18) programs that are more geared towards that. So the kind of
hold versus sell is really by the nature of the loan. The overall production was $1.1 billion in the second quarter,
just up from $853 million and the full production was comparable.
So I mean, as we go forward from here, I mean as we sit here today, purchase activity is about 58% of the retail
volume, 55% in the first quarter, so another kind of key indicator. Things seem to have stabilized somewhat as far
as gain-on-sale margins and through the third quarter, we're looking at around the same level, but there's some
upside there depending on what happens with rates which we all know is impossible to predict. But the margins
having stabilized is definitely a positive as we go forward and we make that decision, like I said, it's based on the
nature of the loan whether it's going in portfolio or selling it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Maybe just switching over, it seems like Charleston had another good quarter
here in the second quarter and I know last quarter, there was a good amount of detail provided on your
expansionary efforts there. How does that market compare from an organic growth standpoint to what had been
going on in Baltimore? Are you confident that you can gain that market organically? Are there opportunities to
supplement that growth through smaller M&A or just as the smaller size of that market relative to the Baltimore
and kind of D.C. MSA make it easier to attract talent and grow there organically?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I think again, a great question. When we look at Charleston, the opportunity in Charleston was it's about a
half – little less than half the size of Baltimore, Pittsburgh in terms of MSA. So we tried to size it. We did an
analysis to see what it would take to de novo into that market adequately cover the marketplace. And we're doing
that with a combination of branch expansion and ATM and ITM deployment within the marketplace, some of it
cobranded ATM deployment.
So I think we came to the conclusion that we could expand into the Charleston market and grow it if we had the
right people and we were positioned properly within the marketplace from a customer access perspective and
then leverage our digital tools and our analytical tools to drive additional growth. And that seems to be working
very well.
I mean when you look at the retail locations that we rolled out, two of the locations have been open for over a year
in the top 25% of our branches from a production perspective. If you look at the C&I team, the team that we
recruited, very solid individuals who I actually enjoy interacting with, the great bankers, with Len Hutchinson and
his team in Charleston have done a phenomenal job. They brought over a number of key clients. And then the
PPP process really helped accelerate that too because it gave us an opportunity to bring on thousands of
customers in the Southeast because some of the larger banks couldn't get the PPP loans processed.
So all of that together has worked exceptionally well for us. So I think Charleston is a de novo opportunity and
there are others that we've pursued, Greenville South Carolina, Asheville. And we've done similar strategies and
they're starting to take off too. So I think there's room for both. We have to evaluate how we want to deploy our
16

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
resources and do it in a way that provides the highest returns for the shareholders. And that in Charleston's
particular instance I think it makes more sense for us to go in de novo.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. I understand. And then just one last one, if I can for Gary. The allowance ratio still seems relatively
elevated and the pace of reserve release is a little bit slower than what we've seen at others. I guess how much
did qualitative factors contribute to the slowing pace of reserve release in the second quarter? And what's the
outlook for future reserve releases? Again, it's – are you all actively trying to moderate that versus what the model
may be spitting out? And at what level do you think you can get back to closer to a day-one type allowance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
When you look at where we sit today, I mean there still exists risk in the economy. We talked about the supply
chain issues, inflation and other items around that. You also have some pandemic starting to pop up again. So
we're going to continue to be a bit cautious with that.
When you go back to CECL day-one, we started at 1.25% from an ACL standpoint. Today we see that 1.51% ex-
PPP. So I would tell you that there surely is some room to continue to move that downwards over time as we work
through the economy and the pandemic and get back to some normalization. So all told, qualitatively, we're at the
higher end of our scale right now. That generally ranges from 20% to 30%, we're at the higher end as we sit here
today. So there is some room there and when I look at the economy normalizing over time, I think we're in a good
spot as we sit here today with some future benefit to come.

David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. Maybe we can stay on that topic, Gary, I don't know if you can quantify this, but assuming normalization in
the loan growth outlook there once we get through some of the PPP churn or so, would you think you'd be back to
reserving on a quarterly basis at that 1.25% of loans? Just curious if there's any color you can get in terms of how
you're thinking about reserving on a more normalized basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, there is a lot that comes into play these days. Mix is an important part of it when you look at the life-of-loan
situation under CECL, but once things normalize and portfolio activity normalizes, yeah, I would feel comfortable
that the economy is going to be back in a spot where you are moving very close to or at normalization from a
provisioning standpoint. So as I just mentioned, I think there is still some uncertainty out there. We're going to
manage it appropriately and we'll work it through the system as the economy continues to improve, stabilize and
the growth starts to normalize. So it'll be a quarter-by-quarter analysis as we look at it each and every quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
The only thing I would add too is that the growth we had, spot growth $550 million, we've provided for that. So that
was probably $7 million or so, so with that negative $1 million benefit really was kind of $8 million except for that
loan growth. So, we always talk about we need to provide for the loan growth, so that was a good problem to
have in the quarter. But the underlying kind of release, a little bit bigger from a kind of pure provision standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, and a lot of that was driven – it was really driven by the improvement in the credit portfolio that we talked
about with reductions in classifieds and all of the credit metrics, all moving in a very positive direction, that really
drove that reduction.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Got it. And then in terms of the loan yields, look like they remain relatively stable here. Just curious if you can
provide some commentary in terms of the onboarding of new loans, originations, that the yields this quarter what
you're seeing, and is there a significant difference across your various markets and regions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I think it's amazingly similar. At this point, I think it's pretty competitive across the board, so the feedback we've
gotten from the field visitors, there's some pressure on credit spreads, the price over cost of funds. I think that
given the environment we are in where everybody is flushed with liquidity obviously that's a – everyone is trying to
grow their loan book. This is very competitive. I think on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the yields have been pretty
similar. I don't think this is a new phenomenon. I don't know if Gary, you want to add to that. I mean I think it's
been sustained for several quarters.

No. I would agree with that. When you look quarter-over-quarter, it's pretty much fairly stable and sitting where it's
been here. It's the occasional transaction that gets really pressured. And as I mentioned earlier, we'll pick our
spots with our clients and be effective there.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A

The higher-quality credit obviously is getting priced very similarly in the market. I think as long as you can justify
the returns on capital invested, cross-sell opportunities, ancillary products and services, capital markets
opportunities, it can work, but the credit spreads are definitely in.

I wanted to ask a little bit about the direct installments and the other loan categories and just wanted to get a
perspective on, I guess, what drove the increases there. Was that due to homes and home equity? And if so,
particularly on the other loan side, I just wanted to get a feel for whether that's due to larger volumes or just the
size of the loans due to the increased car prices.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, it was really driven by the home equity book. The home equity book, we've been very active in that. Our
home equity installment product has been a very good product for us that we have seen good solid growth and
good solid activity in. The automobile book growing slightly, there's issues in the supply chain there as well with
new inventory. So in terms of that book, it's growing at a much smaller pace, but it's really being driven in that
home equity installment product at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And I think as you – at the beginning of the pandemic, people were afraid to do anything, all of a sudden trillions
of dollars of stimulus flowed into the economy, people began – individuals, consumers began to regain
confidence. They either bought a new house and paid 20% more than they would have before the pandemic or
they decided, hey, I'm going to renovate my home now. And that's what we're starting to see, we're seeing an
escalation in our direct installment portfolio in particular and the pipelines have grown principally because of
where we are in the cycle relative to the pandemic.
And I think the overall effect of stimulus has led to people taking a little more risk in terms of improving their
property and then they're seeing property value appreciation which gives that added confidence, right, to get that
done. So I think all of that is kind of flowing in here. I'm not sure that we're the most aggressive lender from an
LTV perspective. I don't think we are. I think it's more a function of the economy and demand for that product
moving up in terms of what's happening.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
In terms of the growth that you are seeing in the auto space, that's kind of seasonally driven. The dealers are
having trouble with new vehicles from that standpoint, that's a smaller part of our business, but it's impacting
activity there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Thanks for the color there. And then just returning to the mortgage side just for a quick question,
there was about a 5% linked quarter growth there. And so, can we assume that that was due to holding the
production on the books?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A

Yeah. I can touch on that. So when you net the credit mark accretion with a loan mark accretion and some of the
smaller items, I mean it really only totals to about 20 bps of the 4% accretion. So on a kind of more cash accretion
basis, you're looking at 3.8% total accretion. In terms of over what timeframe, we assume a five year life of the
loan portfolio and that's pretty much accreted straight line. So on a net basis, it's relatively small and less than like
$1 million.

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, just one on the PPP, just the timing of the forgiveness or just the recognition of the remaining $45 million. Do
you guys have any kind of big picture thoughts on how that plays out or how are you seeing that unfolds the next
couple of quarters and into next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, the forgiveness that I mentioned, what we had built into our estimates is $0.5 billion. The $45 million is just
for the full year and this is full contribution – yeah, most will be this year, we'll have some tail that will go into next
year and 50% full year. Yeah. Probably about 10% or 15%, Brian, it would carry over into next year. But we would
expect I mean the pace that the SBA was forgiving, if they really ramped up in the second quarter, we would think
with round 2 now starting to get forgiven, that would start to accelerate at some point. We just don't know exactly
when. So we're a little conservative in our $500 million that we're assuming for the third quarter, as more
opportunity for that number would be higher. But the vast majority of what's left with the cover come through this
year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. Perfect. And then, just going to the margin for a minute, can you just give any thoughts on the
margin accretion that comes from Howard and then just on the core margin this quarter, it sounded – still
obviously this is the second quarter of kind of incremental increase, just how you're thinking about that core
margin going forward, I guess it sounds like it's at a bottom, it's just continuing to trend higher based on some of
the commentary on loan growth and maybe utilization getting better. But just kind of the Howard add and then just
the core margin, if you can give any color, Vince.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Let me – I'll touch on the core margin and maybe [ph] ask Vince (01:01:32) to comment on Howard impact,
when I'm finished with that. But just a couple of comments here. So, right, net interest income went up $5 million.
Now while the PPP contribution was up $2 million, [indiscernible] (01:01:43) was down $2 million, so they kind of
got a push there. So the growth that we saw was driven by the spot loan growth, the $515 million that we talked
about as well as continued reductions in the cost of interest-earning deposits.
So as we go ahead from here, I mean on the interest-bearing deposit costs side, we brought it down another [ph]
7 to 24 (01:02:03) for the quarter. The spot is 22 basis points at the end of the quarter. We have continued benefit
from CD maturities that continue to roll down. I mean there's $160 million to $200 million a month for the next
three months that are on our books at 65 to 85 basis points [indiscernible] (01:02:24) basis points or so. So that
will continue to provide some benefit. There's still some opportunity kind of on the commercial side too.
And I guess to put the CDs in perspective, the total cost of that portfolio at June 30 was [ph] 84 (01:02:38), we
look for that to come down another 15 basis points or so by the end of the year. And that's kind of baked into our
guidance.
As we look ahead to the third quarter, excluding PPP, which we commented on this some variability there, we
expect net interest income to be up slightly. The stronger the loan growth is, the stronger you get there of course,
and the core NIM is going to be flattish from here, I mean we're trading PPP for kind of the normal loans, as I
22

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
would call them, so that will kind of roll through the portfolio. But kind of flattish on the margin and up on net
interest income, given those factors that the loan growth plus the continued opportunity to bring down the cost of
deposit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. And on the impact to the overall margin with the Howard combination, as you know, Howard's margin is
higher than ours in the low-to-mid-3s. So when you kind of flap them together, it is going to be modestly accretive
to our margin. I wouldn't say a whole lot. And part of that's also due to some of the balance sheet items that we
plan to execute on that Vince alluded to earlier on. So it's a very modest contribution to a higher margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Perfect. Okay. And then just the hover of the Baltimore loan portfolio today, and I guess, how does that stand?
Maybe if you commented on that, maybe I missed them. Sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
When you say how does it stand, are you asking about the size of the portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. It's just how is that trending today that, the Baltimore portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
It's trending upwards. The exposure there is [ph] $3.3 million (01:04:28) in total, and balances are right around
$2.5 billion, Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
$2.5 billion, okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And it's been moving up nicely at a 15% rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. That's what it sounded like. Okay. And then just the last one or two for me was just on the – just Vincent,
you gave a lot of color and I appreciate it on the M&A, just to kind of understand what's happening there, I mean
just a dialog on M&A today. I guess if you can give some color on that and then just the – just curious if you lay
out what you'd be looking at from an M&A perspective, how large a transaction could you potentially consider, if it
met the criteria you mentioned earlier, just trying to understand where the opportunities are, how big an
opportunity you may consider if it was appropriate.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I don't think – again I'm going to refer back to the comments that I made, Brian. I think that we're going to
focus on minimal tangible book value dilution, strong IRRs. And we're going to evaluate what's best for the
shareholders. And when you look at this transaction, this is the best way for us to deploy capital at this point in
time. Obviously, if we start rolling loans nicely, that usually ends up being the highest return on capital invested.
So that's how we look at it.
This particular – obviously given the activity everybody knows there's quite a bit of M&A activity going on. So it
doesn't take much to stumble across a conversation, right? We all know that. We're going to be very disciplined in
how we move forward. And that's again I think my prepared comments kind of summed it all up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q

...acquisition as I mentioned again in my comments, the tangible book value dilution on a whole company basis
was de minimis, right? We earned it already. It's not going to change how we look at deployment of capital moving
forward, which includes buybacks, the dividend, the [indiscernible] (01:06:47). So we're going to continue to
deploy our disciplined capital management strategy that we laid out for you over the last few quarters, and that's
still going to be part of our decision making process.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask just a follow-up on actually net charge-offs, Gary. There's
obviously a lot of pieces that are moving within CECL and loan growth that all affect provision levels, but net
charge-offs at 6 or 7 basis points depending on how you look at it are historically low for you all. Was there
anything that was kind of like onetime-y in there in terms of recovery? And should we expect kind of low levels
and then trend higher back to that 20 basis points to 25 basis points kind of over time or just any outlook there
would be helpful?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Actually, Michael, it went the other way. We had net charge-offs as you know of $3.8 million in the quarter and
that was really driven by one acquired account that we've been working through over the last few years from the
Yadkin acquisition. That was a $4.2 million write-down during the quarter. So, absent that which – and that was
previously reserved for quite a while back. Absent that, we would have had a net recovery quarter this quarter.
So, the book really across all of the portfolios is performing really nicely right now.
Naturally, we talk about the charge-off levels in that normal range of ours, and eventually I would expect that
things will normalize over time. Right now, the positions that we've made in moving some higher-risk asset
classes off of the books over the last number of years has really benefited us. We also are sitting here with an
outlook for more upgrades as I mentioned earlier which should provide some benefit going into Q3. So as we sit
here today and I've been communicating this regularly, the portfolio and the position of us, we feel really good
about it at the moment.

And I will tell you, I'll remind everybody, we are OCC and Fed regulated. So we have a very professional, strong
oversight on our portfolio. We've gone through, what, several reviews since the pandemic started, and have been
in constant touch with the OCC. So we're feeling pretty good about the credit situation here. Gary and his team
have done a terrific job.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay, great. Thanks for the color. My last one is just on PPP forgiveness. Can you maybe just talk about
qualitatively what's going on with customers as that happens, are you guys retaining additional deposits or
expanding relationships, just kind of qualitative factors that we should be thinking of as this continues throughout
the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I don't have any hard, fast facts for you at my fingertips, but there were approximately 5,000 PPP loans in
the first two rounds. I don't know what the third round tells, because we kept that mostly for our customers, but
probably several hundred more I would say in prospect, but the 5,000 or so were purely prospects. They were
largely centered around our Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions because there were several large banks that
couldn't provide PPP loans in a timely fashion or bought people out. So we have been capitalizing on converting
those clients.
Every PPP borrower that we've had opened a depository account because we have a fully automated process
that was part of our authentication process as well. So many of those deposit balances have grown which is why
our demand deposits in particular have gone up fairly substantially. So there's been an element of retention that's
going on and the team is very focused on staying in touch with those companies waiting for the opportunity to bid
on their credit facilities as they renew. That's where we are.

taking resounding cost out of the company was a focus, growing loan portfolio was a focus. All of that takes a

up and this shows in the quarter. So thank you and thank you for your support and the questions, great detailed
