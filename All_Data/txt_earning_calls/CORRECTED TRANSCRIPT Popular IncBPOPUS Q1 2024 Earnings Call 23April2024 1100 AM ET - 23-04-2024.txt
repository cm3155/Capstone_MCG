Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Ignacio Alvarez.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Good morning and thank you for joining the call. We are pleased to report a solid first quarter. Net income totaled
$103 million, which includes the impact of an additional accrual for the FDIC Special Assessment and a tax
expense related to prior intercompany distribution. Excluding these items, net income would have been $135
million compared to adjusted net income of $140 million in the previous quarter.
The results in the first quarter were driven by higher net interest income and a lower provision for credit losses,
offset in part by lower non-interest income, and a slightly higher operating expenses.
Our ending loan balances increased by $54 million during the quarter, with large commercial payoffs impacting
both banks. Our average loan balances, however, increased by $612 million, driven by a substantial amount of
loan activity toward the end of the fourth quarter.
BPPR generated loan growth of $124 million, driven by growth in mortgage and auto, offset in part by decreases
in personal and commercial loans. Popular Bank saw a $70 million decrease in loan balances driven by
commercial loan payoffs that offset growth in construction loans. Deposit balances increased by approximately
$191 million, driven primarily by a higher level of retail demand deposits in BPPR, which increased by $232
million offset somewhat by lower Puerto Rico public deposits.
Our net interest margin increased by 8 basis points to 3.16%, mainly driven by higher average loan balances and
the repricing of loans and securities in a higher interest rate environment. This was partially offset by higher
deposit costs. Non-interest income remained solid at $164 million. Excluding the additional FDIC assessment and
the expenses associated with the prior period tax expense, operating expenses increased by $3 million.
Credit quality trends remained generally favorable with slightly lower NPLs and delinquencies. We have continued
to see credit normalization in the Puerto Rico unsecured consumer segments, which began in the second half of
last year and we continue to be attentive to the evolving credit landscape. Tangible book value per share
increased by $0.32 as our quarterly net income was offset in part by dividends and an increase in unrealized
losses in our investment portfolio.
Please turn to slide 4. Last year, we crossed a significant milestone in Puerto Rico and now serve more than 2
million unique customers. We believe that there continues to be opportunity to deliver more value and services to
our clients and deepen those relationships. For the past two years, we have been engaged in a company-wide
transformation and we are confident that these efforts will help us capitalize upon that opportunity.
Consumer spending remained healthy. Combined credit and debit card sales increased by 2% compared to the
first quarter of 2023. Our auto loan and lease balances increased by $80 million compared to the fourth quarter,
as demand for new cars continued to be strong in Puerto Rico. Mortgage loan balances at BPPR increased by
$92 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by home purchase activity and our strategy to retain FHA loans in
portfolio.
The Puerto Rico economy performed well during the quarter. Business activity is solid, as reflected in the positive
trends in total employment and other economic data. The tourism and hospitality sector continues to be a source
of strength for the local economy. Passenger traffic at the San Juan International Airport increased by 12% in the

first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, in March, the hotel occupancy rate increased to
84% from 79% in March of 2023. The average daily rate and RevPAR increased by 10% and 17%, respectively,
compared to the same month a year ago.
There are a significant amount of committed federal funds that have yet to be disbursed. The pace of
disbursement of these funds has accelerated, and we anticipate that they will support economic activity for
several years. We are encouraged by the performance of the Puerto Rico economy. We remain optimistic about
the future of our primary market and are well-positioned to support our clients during in the coming years. In short,
we are pleased with the results for the quarter, particularly in Puerto Rico, where continued loan growth and the
strength of our deposit base helped contribute to our increase in net interest income and support our optimistic
outlook for the balance of the year.
On that note, I'll now turn the call over to Jorge for more details on our financial results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio, and thank you all for joining the call today. As Ignacio stated in his remarks, we reported net
income of $103 million in the first quarter. Excluding the effect of the FDIC assessment and the tax expenses
related to prior period intercompany distributions, adjusted net income was $135 million, $5 million lower than the
prior quarter's adjusted results.
Although the quarter had some noise because of these two items, we are pleased with the core results,
particularly the NII growth and the expansion of the NIM. Net interest income increased by $17 million in the
quarter. Our net interest margin increased by 8 basis points on a GAAP basis and 12 basis points on a tax-
equivalent basis, driven by higher average loan balances and the repricing of loans and securities. We should
continue to see NIM expansion throughout the rest of 2024.
Consistent with our previous guidance, we expect our 2024 NII to increase by approximately 9% to 13% from
2023 levels. Loan growth this quarter was lower than recent trends, driven by the early repayment of two large
loans totaling around $200 million and decreased loan demand in the US Mainland. The underlying economic
activity in Puerto Rico remains strong. And as such, we continue to expect loan growth of 3% to 6% in 2024.
Non-interest income was $164 million, a decrease of $5 million from Q4 driven by lower contingent commissions
in our insurance business, which are usually recognized in the second and fourth quarter of each year. We
continue to expect non-interest income to be approximately $160 million to $165 million per quarter in 2024.
We were also pleased to see stable credit metrics and the early benefits of changes we implemented to address
the credit losses that arose late last year in our consumer loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses was $73
million compared to $79 million in the fourth quarter.
Total operating expenses were $483 million, including the additional expense of $14 million related to the FDIC
special assessment and $6 million in expenses related to the late payment of taxes from prior period
intercompany distributions. Excluding these two items, operating expenses were $462 million, an increase of $3
million from Q4's adjusted operating expenses.
Other significant expense variances in the quarter were higher personnel costs by $21 million, mainly due to
annual incentive awards and payroll taxes, which are traditionally higher during the first quarter of the year, and

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
higher credit card processing expenses by $6 million, mainly due to lower volume driven rebates in the first
quarter.
These expenses were offset in part by a decrease in professional fees by $10 million, mainly related to regulatory
consulting fees and other advisory expenses. Business promotion expenses were also lower, as these are
typically higher in the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding the impact of the incremental FDIC expense and expenses
related to the tax liabilities from their prior period distributions, we continue to expect annual expenses in the
range of $1.89 billion to $1.95 billion for 2024
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 35%, due mainly to having recorded $17 million in income tax expense
related to prior period intercompany dividends from our US subsidiary to the Puerto Rico Bank Holding Company.
These dividends are subject to a 10% federal tax withholding and ordinary income tax in Puerto Rico that we
failed to pay for several years. Therefore, these results reflect the cumulative effect of correcting this oversight.
Excluding the impact of the FDIC Special Assessment and their prior period tax matter, the effective tax rate
would have been 25%. This adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 also reflects approximately $7 million in income tax
expenses arising from a $50 million distribution from the US sub completing during this quarter. We do not
anticipate the tax treatment of US sourced dividends to the bank holding companies to impact liquidity or future
capital action. On a GAAP basis, we now expect the effective tax rate for the year to be in a range of 21% to 23%.
This includes the impact of the $17 million in income tax expense related to the prior period distribution.
Please turn to slide 6. Net interest margin increased by 8 basis points. On a taxable equivalent basis, NIM was
3.38%, an increase of 12 basis points. The increase was driven by higher loan yields and average balances
across most lending categories as well as higher yields in our investment portfolio. This was partially offset by
higher interest expense on deposits due to increased average balance of public deposits at BPPR and high cost
online deposits at Popular Bank. Excluding Puerto Rico deposits, consolidated customer deposit balances
increased by roughly $240 million, primarily in retail accounts.
At the end of the first quarter, Puerto Rico public deposits were $18 billion, down slightly compared to Q4 and at
the upper end of our guidance range. For the rest of 2024, we expect public deposits to be in the range of $15
billion to $18 billion. As usual, normal seasonality should result in public deposit balances trending higher and
peaking in Q2, mostly related to tax receipts. Our interest rate sensitivity remains relatively neutral. A higher for a
longer rate environment should not have a significant impact on our NII forecast for 2024, except to the extent that
such an environment increases pressure on deposit pricing, particularly in our US operations due to changes in
client or competitor behavior.
Please turn to slide 7. Deposit betas in the current tightening cycle are above the prior cycle. We have seen a
total cumulative deposit beta of 35% to date, driven by public deposits in Puerto Rico and online deposits in the
US. The rate of increase in deposit costs for the corporation continued to slow down in the quarter. In BPPR total
deposit costs increased by 2 basis points, compared to an increase of 11 basis points in Q4, led by higher-
average balances of public deposits. The cost of public deposits decreased by 1 basis point. At Popular Bank,
deposit costs increased by 23 basis points compared to an increase of 33 basis points in Q4, driven by the
deposits gathered primarily through our online channel.
Please turn to slide 8. We continue to target a sustainable 14% return on tangible common equity by the end of
2025.Regulatory capital levels remain strong. Our CET1 ratio of 16.4% increased by 6 basis points from Q4.
Tangible book value per share at the quarter end was $60.06, an increase of $0.32 per share from Q4. Our long-
term outlook on capital return has not changed. Over time, we expect our regulatory capital ratios to gravitate

towards the levels of our mainland peers plus a buffer driven by our geographic concentration in Puerto Rico. We
continue working towards announcing new capital actions in the second half of 2024. The size and nature of any
future capital actions will depend on the outlook of the interest rate environment, including the impact on our TCE
ratio.
With that I turn the call over to Lidio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Jorge, and good morning. Credit quality metrics were stable from the fourth quarter as trends
remained consistent with recent performance. The corporation's mortgage and commercial portfolios continue to
reflect credit metrics significantly below pre-pandemic levels, but credit quality metrics continue to normalize for
Puerto Rico's unsecured personal loans, credit cards and auto and lease finance loans. We continue to closely
monitor changes in the macroeconomic environment and on borrower performance. Given higher rates – higher
interest rates and inflationary pressure, I have made changes to underwriting criteria to decrease exposure to
higher risk segments. We believe that the improvements over recent years in risk management practices and the
risk profile of the corporation loans portfolios positions Popular to continue to operate successfully under the
current environment.
Turning to slide number 9. Non-performing assets and non-performing loans decreased slightly driven by the
Puerto Rico region. NPLs in Puerto Rico decreased by $30 million, reflecting improvements in most loan
categories. NPLs in the US increased by $27 million related to higher mortgage NPLs by $17 million, impacted by
a single loan, and higher commercial NPLs by $10 million. Inflows of NPLS increased by $8 million driven by the
previously mentioned increasing NPLs in the US mortgage and commercial portfolios. In Puerto Rico, total inflows
decreased by $19 million, driven by $18 million relationships that enter NPL in the fourth quarter of 2023. The
ratio of NPL to total loans held in portfolio remained flat at 1%.
Turning to slide number 10. Net charge-off amounted to $62 million or annualized 71 basis points of average
loans held-in portfolio compared to $57 million or 66 basis points in the prior quarter. The increase in net charge-
off was driven by a $5 million charge-off related to a previously reserved loan. Excluding this, the charge-offs
were flat. In Puerto Rico, net charge-offs increased by $5 million, mainly driven by higher commercial and
consumer net charge-offs. Net charge-offs in the US were flat quarter-over-quarter. We continue to expect net
charge-offs for the full year to be between 65 basis points to 85 basis points due to the ongoing credit
normalization and general economic environment.
Please turn to slide number 11. The allowance for credit losses increased by $10 million to $740 million. In Puerto
Rico, the ACL increased by $4 million driven by the consumer portfolio due to changes in credit quality. In the US,
the ACL increased by $6 million, driven by higher commercial loan reserves due to rating migration. The
corporation ratio of ACL to loans held-in portfolio remained flat at 2.1% while the ratio of ACL to NPLs stood at
209% compared to 204% in the previous quarter. The provision for credit losses was $72 million compared to $75
million in the prior quarter. In Puerto Rico, the provision was $61 million, compared to $67 million, while in the US
the provision was $11 million versus $8 million.
To summarize, credit quality remained stable during the first quarter consistent with recent performance. We are
attentive to the evolving environment but remain encouraged by the performance of our loan book.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks.

Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Lidio and Jorge, for your updates. Popular started off 2024 with a solid first quarter, building on the
positive momentum seen in 2023. Our results are driven by strong net interest income and expanding net interest
margin, stable credit quality and continued customer growth. The strength of our franchise is once again reflected
in the increase experienced during the quarter in retail demand deposits in Puerto Rico.
Last week, we launched our new institutional marketing campaign in Puerto Rico titled Seguimos Tu Ritmo or We
Follow Your Rhythm. This campaign includes a custom composed audio brand and focuses on our unmatched
omni-channel offering, highlighting our wide range of financial services through digital and traditional channels as
well as our convenience and accessibility. We have also made great progress in our transformation effort and
some of those initiatives are already producing encouraging results. We will continue these efforts to ensure our
organizational success for many years to come. This entails meeting the rapidly changing needs of our
customers, providing our colleagues a workplace where they can thrive, promoting progress in the communities
we serve and generating sustainable value for our shareholders.
I am optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of 2024. Economic trends in Puerto Rico continue to be
positive and we are well positioned to participate in the economic activity that is expected to be generated in the
coming years. I want to thank our colleagues for their continued dedication and commitment to serve our
customers and contribute to Popular's success.
We are now ready to answer your questions.

economic growth and net income growth. And so if you could just update us what you're thinking in terms of
possibly announcing a share buyback program in the next 6 months to 12 months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Well, I think we're going to reiterate what we said. We're working hard. We anticipate that we will be making an
announcement about our plans and that'll be in the second half of the year. I really – we wouldn't want to pinpoint
it too much in terms of specific months or whatnot, but we are – rest assured, we know people want to hear from
us and we're working hard to make some kind of announcement.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And I guess as a follow-up just for that question, are – because your capital levels – I know you haven't given us a
specific CET1 ratio that you want to manage to. But assuming you're comfortable to say that your current levels
are more than sufficient, would you be willing or would you consider a program that would actually give back more
capital to shareholders in dividends and buybacks that would exceed a current period of earnings so that the
combined ratio, if you will, would exceed 100%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Gerard, this is Jorge. I mean, I think at this stage, as we said in the prepared remarks, the level of any new capital
actions that we announce will depend on a lot of factors. As Ignacio said, we know this is important to our
shareholders. We have that in mind. And I guess I'd say let's get started with an announcement sometime in the
second half, and then, we'll see where we go from there. But it's important that we set the stage. We would expect
capital actions to be gradual over time. This is not going to be a step function or we see a huge decrease or
something like that. It will be over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. And then just as a final question, when you guys look at the next two years to three years, what's the
optimal mix of money market and investment securities as a percentage of assets relative to loans? Do you – are
you comfortable keeping it in the 45% to 50% range or would it over time maybe gradually come down further?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I'll let Jorge add to that, but I think it's going to depend on the level of public funds, right? So to the extent
that the...

...public funds go down, we would expect that the investment securities go down. If you ask me, I always prefer
more loans to investment securities, but I think it's going to depend on the – it's going to be mostly dependent on
the level of public funds. If they go down, you can expect the percentage of investment securities to go down also.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Looking at just the NII performance in the first quarter and then your unchanged guidance for the year,
annualizing first quarter performance gets you to the upper end of the guidance, you get a seasonally strong
quarter for deposits in 2Q. Loan growth is going to pick up kind of versus where first quarter came in, is it safe to
say that you're kind of targeting closer to the upper end of the guidance? I guess what would need to take place
for you to come in closer to the lower end of your guidance at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
I'll reiterate, we reaffirm the guidance 9% to 13%. We give a range for a reason, Timur. In terms of the risk to the
guidance, I think we talked about it a little bit on the prepared remarks. I think the deposit – competitive deposit
activity, particularly in our US operations, if a higher for a longer environment or another bank failure creates a lot
of pressure for liquidity and competition, those are the kinds of things that would have – would impact that
guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then I guess just speaking to deposits more specifically with public funds being at $18 billion in 1Q, 2Q
being seasonally high, are those expected to go higher? And I guess in that same line of questioning, maybe the
competition for those deposits is a little bit more on the island. Are you anticipating having to pay up to get your
fair share of kind of that seasonal deposit growth in the second quarter?

Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
No, the – no. The public deposits generally have a formula that we abide by, so it's just really going to depend on,
we noted before, it's a formula based on short-term rates. So that's not going to depend on the competitive
pressures. The banks in Puerto Rico in terms of the non-public deposits would continue to have very healthy loan-
to-deposit ratio, perhaps too healthy. So I don't see that kind of competitive environment changing in the short
run.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just last for me, looking at the unsecured consumer credit and maybe some of these other
consumer categories, we're hearing in the US from some of the consumer companies [ph] that just see (00:25:53)
lot of activity during the pandemic. Now seasoning, you're seeing kind of a commensurate increase in delinquency
rates with the expectations for that to actually peak and then move lower throughout the course of the year.
Should we expect a similar dynamic in Puerto Rico or maybe as you get through some of the excess capacity that
was took on during COVID as that rolls off, could we actually see some of these consumer delinquency rates to
decline as some of the underwriting criteria kind of kicks in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
I think a couple of things. Yes, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, during the first quarter, we saw a
stability of our – actually a decrease in some of the delinquencies in some of the consumer portfolios, which
would help us to believe that maybe we're close to reaching a peak. In addition to that, as you mentioned, we
made significant changes in the fourth quarter to some of our underwriting criteria. And those just being short
dated or short duration portfolios will tend to have an impact in the short term. So, yes, we expect that we'll see a
peak soon.

Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hey. Good morning, everybody. I had a question around the multifamily US portfolio of $1.4 billion, which is, I
guess, 4% of the total portfolio. So it's not huge, but I didn't understand the comment on slide 22 that says no
exposure to rent control buildings, but then the next bullet says rent stabilized units represent less than 40% of
the total units in the portfolio. Can you explain the rent control piece of the multifamily portfolio? And then,
obviously, multifamily is something folks are thinking about. The classifieds are still low for you guys, but they did
increase [ph] one (00:28:00) quarter. Just want to get a better understanding of the book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
I think with multifamily in New York there are different levels. Obviously, there are market-rate apartments. There
are rent stabilized apartments which allow for certain increases in rent provided by on a yearly basis, I think, by

the state government and then there are rent controlled in which the rents basically are fixed for a period of time.
So we're saying that we have no exposure to rent control apartments. We have exposure to rent stabilized
apartment.

Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
I don't think we would provide that level of detail in – or that level of guidance in any of our portfolio. What I would
say that as we put in page – I think you referenced page 22, there are – the biggest risk when you look at
multifamily, the level of rent control, rent stabilization and then the risk of repricing of the portfolio going forward,
as we mentioned in that slide, we only have about $38 million of multifamily loans repricing in 2024 that have
more than 50% stabilized unit in the apartments. So we feel comfortable and I think is reflected in the ratings of
our portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. Thanks, Lidio. And then wanted to ask back on capital. When I look at slide, I think it's the investment
portfolio, it's slide 19. When I go back to the 10-K and look at the fair value marks on securities portfolio, if you
look at the duration on slide 19, it's two years. But then if you look at the 10-K, there's a pretty good [ph] slog
(00:30:12) that's I call it a barbell strategy. Can you guys talk about any willingness to maybe restructure the
longer piece of the securities portfolio that at year-end was about $1 billion of $1.3 billion in total AOCI?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Brett, one thing I think in the 10-K, the MBS portfolio is structured based on original maturity, it doesn't have a
prepayment factor, which you would see in the maturity profile that you have on slide 19. So I think that's a
difference between the way we report for SEC requirements versus this slide. So in terms of the maturity curve, I
would look at slide 19. When you see particularly on the treasuries, you see a ladder strategy where we're seeing
quarterly maturities of somewhere around $900 million. When you add prepayment maturities on MBS's of around
$150 million a quarter, you really are repricing about $1 billion a quarter. We expect about 33% of our unrealized
loss at the end of this quarter to have been accreted back to tangible book value by the end of 2025 assuming no
changes in the rate scenario, of course. So we believe that given our profile and the amount of the unrealized loss
that's just going to naturally accrete back to tangible book value, a trade where we realize a loss doesn't make
sense. Essentially any trade with a similar duration, it has no economic value to our shareholders and we're just
trading capital, a big chunk of capital for EPS. And at this stage, we don't believe that that's a good trade.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. That's really helpful. And if I could sneak in one last one on the unchanged NII guidance and relative to the
loan growth guidance, is it fair to assume the balance sheet is very flat for the year?

Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
I mean, what would drive growth in the balance sheet would be growth in deposits as we would probably – given
the amount of liquidity and securities. So I would say that when you look at the NII guidance, it is really driven by
the repricing of those investment portfolios that are maturing every quarter. You have the repricing of loans in a
higher-rate environment. I mean, just to run in place, we have to generate a lot of new loans every quarter so that
there is a lift from that. If public deposits come down, given our range where we are at the top end of the range
that will reduce the balance sheet. So, I mean, I don't – we don't give guidance in terms of [indiscernible]
(00:33:12) balance sheet is going to be, but there are a lot of levers there that could impact that projection.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Just curious, in terms of the charge-off guidance, I mean, the 65 basis points to 85 basis points is a pretty wide
range. I guess at the beginning of the year, there was quite a bit of – the range of outcomes is pretty wide. It
seems like not only things are slowing down, they're showing clear plateauing effect. Is it fair to think that the 85
basis points is a bit draconian at this level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
I mean we're providing the guidance that – and we updated the guidance to 65 basis points to 85 basis points. I
think you're right in a sense that as we move along the year, there can be more confidence in terms of the
guidance, but as of today we're sticking with the 65 basis points to 85 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q

thinking high level. I'm just trying to look – I know you don't want to give guidance for 2025 or 2026 at this point,
but just thinking from an operational perspective, is there any way or any opportunities to kind of just tighten up
the expense base? I think you're doing a great job now. I'm just kind of curious how you get even better from
here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
I mean, I think, as you said, we don't want to give guidance for 2025 [ph] fair enough (00:35:09) 2026. But we're
doing a lot of efforts in the transformation that help us to go towards that 2025 ROTCE guidance. Most of that
effort, we believe, is top line driven. So we'll be creating operational efficiencies. And while we always are focused
on managing cost and trying to make sure we slow down the acceleration of expenses, I would not expect a driver
that would decrease our expense base significantly. I would see more of an opportunity to create more efficiency,
operational efficiency from higher revenues and slowing down the growth of expenses.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Maybe looking at the loan growth in light of the weaker end-of-period balances this quarter
from some of those payoffs, what gives you confidence in the pipeline here? Do you feel just that we're – we
should see some C&I and CRE growth accelerate to keep that range stable here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Well – this is Ignacio. In terms of Puerto Rico, I mean, the – we're still optimistic about the economic conditions,
which after all that's what's going to end up in loan growth. So the economy seems going strong. I mean we're
seeing a lot of interest from clients and different deals. We're seeing investors asking around. So we don't give a
number on the pipeline, but given the environment is strong, so I would expect the commercial loan growth will
pick up. I would expect construction will pick up. The number of construction projects that we've signed up but
haven't really disbursed any funds [indiscernible] (00:37:13) remain strong. And I would consider that will remain
strong. So I think in Puerto Rico, you're going to see [indiscernible] (00:37:18) commercial will go up and I think
auto will remain strong. We're building up our mortgage loan – our strategy of holding mortgages in portfolio that
should be relatively steady.
In the US, I think we are expecting the construction loans to go up in the New York area and in our Popular
Association Banking subsidiary we're also expecting growth there. And as you know, in Florida, after there was
that horrible accident with the condominium, they passed a number of laws and regulations that require that
condominiums do certain appraisals of the assessment of their – the structural integrity of the units. And I think
there's a deadline coming up in February 25th. So we expect to see a lot of activity there. And hopefully, we'll be
able to pick up some more regular commercial growth. But – and generally, in Puerto Rico, it's the economic
environment that gives us the confidence to maintain the guidance on the loan growth.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Great. That's good color. Thanks. And then looking at deposits, it really feels like you found a stable level
here on DDAs as a percentage of total deposits. Should we expect that DDAs keep track growth in the overall
deposits from here? Or could there still be some incremental diminishment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
That depends a lot on the interest rate environment. We did get benefit of this as a tax season. So there's tax
refunds and that goes into people's – usually, it goes into people's DDA accounts. We'll have to see the
consumers, the higher-end consumer and the commercial clients are still looking for alternatives to regular
demand deposits. So, we can expect that trend to continue as interest rates remain high. But we do feel that our
regular retail demand deposits are reflecting really the strength of our branch network. And they may had a bit
more of a significant pickup this quarter, although a lot of the refunds occur in April also. So, we'll get some
benefit of that in April. So, that may have been a short-term thing. But in general, we feel pretty strong about our
retail deposit franchise.

Wanted to go back to a comment you made, Jorge, about just the amount of churn in the loan portfolio and kind of
just the amount of new generation need just to stay in – to stay where you are. And then the yield lift that is kind of
inherent with that. We see some nice yield lift this quarter like at 7.5% overall loan yields, like, can you give us a
sense for like what kind of loan yield lift still remains in the portfolio, assuming we see churn at similar rates to
what we've seen in the past couple of quarters?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
Alex, I think I'd be lying if I tell you I had that level of granularity, let's say – let's look at the different components.
The investment portfolio, we feel very comfortable that you're going to get a 300 basis point plus lift in that. I think
with the loans, it depends on when those loans were made. It depends what type of loans they are. I would
expect, particularly around our commercial clients, that any renewals in this environment should reflect the higher
yields, but we do see perhaps some maybe compression in some of those margins. I guess at this stage, I will
stick to the NII guidance, Alex.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Ignacio, earlier you talked about some of the long portfolio categories you expect to grow the commercial,
the construction, the auto? Are there any categories that you'd expect to be a headwind in terms of overall
balances that maybe would decline in the next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Well, we've tightened up our – some of our credit policies around some of the unsecured consumer portfolio. So I
don't expect you to see a lot of growth in personal loans and credit cards. So, those are really the only areas that I
would pinpoint that I think we're not – I don't feel – and it's for a reason. It's because we've tightened up. So, we
can expect that those are probably – and personal loans especially are subject to amortization. So, if we don't
originate at the rate we were, it's going to go down. So, those are the only two categories I would highlight.
Mortgage depends on the interest rate. So, it's not a great environment for originating mortgage loans because of
the high interest rates. So we're basically limited to home purchase, others are refinancing now. However, we're
holding more in portfolios so that sort of makes up. So, I think mortgage may be more steady. I don't think – I
don't know if mortgage will go down, but it'll be steady. But I do think that personal loans and credit card that were
not expecting on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Thanks for that color. And then you alluded to a $17.2 million mortgage in the press release and BPNA that
migrated into NPLs. Was that a residential mortgage or is that multifamily?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
It's a residential mortgage. I think Lidio will give you more color on that. He wants me to give you more color on
that. Yeah. This was a loan we made in a very expensive home in New York, and it's not something we normally
do. It was a special situation for our client that had other relationships with us. And so it's really, in my opinion, it's
something that it's a one-off. So – but it is a residential mortgage. But you have a solid loan-to-value ratio. So
we're not anticipating losing any money on that loan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good. And it would it be like a high-profile divorce or something like that that would result in something like that?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
No, I don't think – again, it's not – I'm pretty certain it's not a divorce. I don't know all the facts, but it's just
someone who went into NPLs and they – again, it's a – it is a single loan to a single borrower in a residential
property in New York, a very luxury property. Something we normally did, we did it as an accommodation for
business reasons and it's – I would – it's a one-off.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. With that, when I look at the yields on the mortgage portfolio, it looked like they dropped this quarter. Is that
– would that be sort of interest like reversal of accrued interest related to that loan?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
I mean, there will be certainly some impact with us because we would reverse three months' worth of interest
related to that loan. But the mortgage portfolio does get impacted in Puerto Rico by tax equivalent adjustments,
Alex. And then I think in the fourth quarter, we may have had a positive benefit in the fourth quarter related to
those adjustments. So it's more that the fourth quarter was maybe a higher yield because of tax equivalent
adjustment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q

FHA loan.

Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q

Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Sure. As I mentioned earlier, there is a lot of efforts related to the transformation that will drive operational
efficiency for us to be able to get to those results. I think at the end of this quarter, we had something like 35, 40
ongoing transformation projects throughout the organization that all eventually contribute to that success to get to
those numbers. I think delays in the projects, I mean, extending where we don't see the lift or the benefits at the
time that we think we're going to be able to see could have an impact on that guidance. Certainly, interest rate
environment, things like that generally impact bank earnings will have a spillover effect of that.

Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. And then, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned with capital planning, one thing you're
looking at with regards to whether to come in again with some capital return is your TCE ratio. And that got as low
as a four handle in 2022. I know we're not guiding specifically to CET1 yet or ready to. But just wondering if
there's any sort of line in the sand that we should be thinking about in terms of where you might be comfortable
with the TCE ratio in terms of like a bottoming level. Just to be mindful on where modeling capital.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
I mean, Kelly, when we look at TCE, I mean, obviously, we are – there are levels that we're comfortable at, but it's
not just a bright line, black and white. We do like to look at the rate scenario. What is the projected rate
environment, what is our sensitivity in our investment portfolio.
So, all those things contribute to our confidence and the level that we're confident at. We believe that we will be
able to come to you in the second half of this year with more information take into consideration all the aspects.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
It's been delayed. There's been objections from many sides, some arguing that the proposed rate hikes that
would pay for the continued charge are too high. The bond – some of the bondholders claiming that the payout is
too low.
So, you've got people arguing all sides of the equation, but I think I'm pretty confident. Maybe not second quarter,
but third quarter probably this gets done this year, I think. Other than that, it's hard to predict, because these legal
proceedings are complex. And the judges, trying to figure it out. There'll be an appeal. Obviously, whatever
happens, there will be an appeal under the permissive statute. Appeals are supposed to be handled
expeditiously.
I mean, there's always a chance that the – that at the end of the day, at the final wire, they reach an agreement
with some of the objecting bondholders. I don't think for 100%, obviously. But there's always that possibility. But I
think this is – it would be hard to speculate exactly when, but I would go out on a limb and say it'll get done this
year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then just as a quick follow-up. Can you remind us what drives the government's deposits? You
mentioned they're elevated right now. Talking about the securities earlier in the call. But what should we keep an
eye on for the government to draw down those deposits? I know there's some seasonality due to tax payments.
But if there was a kind of a downward shift in, what should we keep an eye on to see if that happens?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I think the most – the thing is what you mentioned, the increase is tax seasonality. I think now that we're paying
debt on the public, paying interest on the public debt. We have a July 1 payment. They'll come up. So, they'll be a
debt payment made on July 1. Other than that, it's really just the way the government runs. Now one of the things
that could impact the government that the fiscal board has mentioned is that in the post-pandemic period, there's
been a number of special packages for all states and municipalities. Some of that money has been used by
Puerto Rico for like the Education Department and other things like that. That money runs out eventually. That
was limited. So, part of that will have to be – come from the treasury of the Puerto Rico government.
So, I think going forward, as some of this post-pandemic stimulus relief comes down, you'll probably see Puerto
Rico spending more. We continue have more infrastructure projects. Part of those projects require Puerto Rico to
pay part of the cost. So, some of that will come down. Other than that, it's hard for us to judge. I mean, over time,
we do expect the liquidity will go down for the reasons I said. I mean, some of the money that they've been using
for education and for health and other things will have to be replaced by Puerto Rico money from the budget. And
I think part of the money that they have, they need to spend for the infrastructure projects to put our share. And
then there's also some COVID money that had a term limit so that if we don't use it, it has to be returned to the
Treasury.
So, I mean, those are the best handles. We don't have great visibility to – actually to the government, but those
are the normal things that we see. Already, we saw the government – the March numbers already reflect a
significant amount of the refund because the government was refunding – is refunding. Given the liquidity, it's
