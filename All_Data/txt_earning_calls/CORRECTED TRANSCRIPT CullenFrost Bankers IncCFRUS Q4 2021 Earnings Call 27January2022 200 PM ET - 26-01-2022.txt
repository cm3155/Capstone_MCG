Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
Thanks, A.B. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review the fourth quarter results for
Cullen/Frost and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, will also provide additional comments before we open
it up to your questions.
In the fourth quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $99.4 million or $1.54 a share, compared with earnings of $88.3 million
or $1.38 a share reported in the same quarter of last year, and a $106.3 million or a $1.65 a share in the third
quarter of 2021. For the full year of 2021, Cullen/Frost earned $435.9 million or $6.76 a share, compared to
earnings of $323.6 million or $5.10 a share reported for 2020. Our return on average assets and average
common equity in the fourth quarter were 0.81% and 9.26%, respectively. I am very pleased with our company's
results and I'm optimistic about the prospects for our organic growth strategy.
Average deposits in the fourth quarter were $41 billion, an increase of more than 20%, compared with $34.1
billion in the fourth quarter of last year. This continued outstanding deposit growth reflects our success in
developing new relationships and expanding current ones. It reflects well on our expansion efforts, our value
proposition enhancements and our world class level of customer service. Jerry will talk more about our deposit
growth in a few moments.
I was very pleased with our success in our commercial lending segment, where we booked $2.4 billion in new
commitments in the fourth quarter, up 64% from the first quarter last year and up an unannualized 37% on a
linked quarter basis. I'm morally certain that's our highest level ever.
The growth was geographically diverse. Compared to last year, fourth quarter C&I commitments were up 73%,
while CRE was up 121%. On a linked quarter, on an annualized basis, C&I commitments were up 27%, while
CRE commitments increased 55%. Jerry will talk more about outstanding loan balances in his comments. As we
book these commitments, our awaited pipeline declined 13% from the third quarter.
I might point out that in Texas, the confluence in the fourth quarter of football season, hunting season and the
holidays combines so that is rare that our year-end pipeline would exceed the third quarter. Just saying. However,
our year-end weighted pipeline was 24% higher than last year's and was our highest fourth quarter ever.
Turning to our consumer business, I am extremely pleased with our progress. In 2021, we brought in almost
27,000 net new checking households. That was 210% of our previous full year household growth record in 2019.
Here's some additional context. In 2016, we added 1,897 net new consumer checking households. Our
compound annual growth in net household additions for that five-year period is 70%. Houston is not the only
reason, but it's helping. It added 413% more checking households in 2021 than we did in 2018 right before our
expansion began. We reported in our release good trust and wealth management numbers, but one other data
point of growth I might offer is that our number of customers for our community wealth advisors were up by 28%
from a year ago. As far as the Houston expansion is concerned, we see the momentum continuing to build as the
branches mature.
The metrics we measure show bankers we hired and onboarded are executing our relationship banking strategy.
At year-end, we stood at 128% of our new household goal. We were 178% of our loan goal. And we were 113%
of our deposit goal. For the year 2021, we added 6,858 new households which was nearly the same amount of
new households we added for the first two years of the expansion. Over the last six months, new households
grew by 30% unannualized, demonstrating the ability to add new customers while the branches matured in these
communities. Loan growth for the year was $218 million or 97% growth, and for the last six months of 2021, loan
growth was an unannualized 42%. Loan portfolio is a mix of 80% commercial loans and 20% consumer loans.
Our focus has been on core loan relationships or small businesses in the community – communities that we are

entering. There are only three loans over $10 million in balances that represent less than 10% of the total loan
portfolio. The mix of loans is reflective of our overall loan portfolio with 40% CRE, 40% C&I and 20% consumer.
We're building a strong foundation of core relationships that will position us to grow with them as their businesses
grow and we meet their needs. Deposit growth for the year was $390 million or 167% from December of 2020.
Over the past six months of 2021, growth continues to be strong at an unannualized 44% rate. Our deposit mix is
two-thirds commercial and one-third consumer, nearly identical to what we had projected to be the mix three
years ago. We continue to be optimistic about growth in this economy. Our 28 branch expansion project in the
Dallas region officially got underway this month with the opening of our first new location, the Frost Medical
District Financial Center. We will continue the process nearly tripling our size in Dallas into 2024. The Dallas
expansion will follow our Houston model and we will employ the lessons learned during our team's successful
rollout. Additionally, we will continue our expansion in Houston, adding another eight locations over the course of
2022 and into 2023.
Credit continues to be good. We did not report a credit loss expense for the fourth quarter. Our asset quality
outlook is stable and in general, problem assets are declining in number. New problems have dropped to pre-
pandemic levels. The net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were $2.8 million compared with $2.1 million in the
quarter. Annualized net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were 7 basis points of average loans. Non-accrual loans
are $53.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter, a decrease from $57.1 million at the end of the third. Overall
delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the fourth quarter were only $121 million or 74 basis points a period
in loans. Excluding PPP, delinquencies were only $97 million. These are manageable pre-pandemic levels. Total
problem loans which we define as risk grade 10 and higher totaled $540 million at the end of the fourth quarter
compared with $635 million at the end of the previous quarter. In the fourth quarter, we continue to make progress
toward our goal of mid-single digit concentration levels in the energy loan portfolio over time, with energy loans
representing 6.6% of loans at the end of the quarter.
Our teams continue to analyze the non-energy portfolio segments that we considered most at risk from the
pandemic impacts, and as of the end of the fourth quarter the total problem loans from hotels and office buildings
represented $178 million. Risk is moderate and stable in these areas and the asset quality outlook improved
significantly during 2021. We've made good progress toward adding residential mortgages to our suite of
consumer real estate products later this year. This will complement our portfolio currently consisting of home
equity, HELOC, home improvement, and purchase money second loans, which has steadily grown to more than
$1.4 billion. Utilizing best-in-class technology will allow us to provide Frost level of world class service as we build
this portfolio over time in response to customer demand.
And after almost two years of working with business customers on PPP loans, we are finally nearing completion
with a forgiveness process complete for more than 93% of our customers. Our team continues to work to get the
last of the borrowers through the process, and I want to commend everyone at Frost, who has worked so hard on
this. Our team took a situation that in the beginning looked difficult and maybe even impossible and turned it into
a huge success for our customers and for our company. At the same time, we're working to ensure that we're not
only taking care of our customers, but our employees and our communities as well. In the fourth quarter, Ross
was a founding member of the Corporate Partners for Racial Equity here in San Antonio, state and state-wide we
announced that we had raised our minimum pay to $20 per hour. Steps like these show our commitment to our
communities and being a force for good in people's everyday lives. That's possible only because of our dedicated
employees, whether they are asked to tackle historic and heroic tasks like handling more than 32,000 PPP loans.
Doubling or even tripling the number of locations we have in the region over a couple of years. Creating a
mortgage lending process from scratch or simply being the best at serving customers around the clock. Our team

at Frost is our true competitive advantage. And I am proud of them for all of their accomplishments despite the
difficulties of the past two years. And I'd like to thank them for contributing every day to our company's success.
Now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas for some additional comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. Looking first at our net interest margin. Our net interest margin percentage for the fourth quarter
was 2.31% down 16 basis points from the 2.47% reported last quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of
the impact of lower PPP loan volumes and their related yields compared to the prior quarter. Excluding the impact
of PPP loans our net interest margin percentage would have been 2.25% in the fourth quarter, down 2 basis
points from an adjusted 2.27% for the – from the third quarter, with the decrease resulting primarily from lower
yields in the investment portfolio, partially offset by higher volumes of investment securities and non-PPP loans.
The taxable equivalent loan yield for the fourth quarter was 3.89%, down 27 basis points from the previous
quarter. But excluding the impact of PPP loans, the taxable equivalent loan yield would have been 3.79%, up 5
basis points from the prior quarter, with about 3 basis points of the increase resulting from non-recurring fees.
To add some additional color on our PPP loans, our total PPP loans at the end of December were $429 million,
down almost $400 million from the $828 million at the end of September. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had
only about $2.8 million in net deferred fees remaining to be recognized. And as such, we don't expect PPP to
have any material impact on our 2022 results. Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio
averaged $14.4 billion during the fourth quarter, up about $1.9 billion from the third quarter average as we
deployed some of our excess liquidity during the fourth quarter. We made investment purchases during the
quarter of approximately $2.9 billion, consisting of about $1.7 billion in Agency MBS members securities, with a
yield of about 2.05%, about $1 billion in treasuries, yielding a 1.27%, and about a $150 million in municipal
securities, with a TE yield of about 2.34%. The taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio was
3.08% in the fourth quarter down 27 basis points from the third quarter. The yield on the taxable portfolio which
averaged $6.1 billion was 1.86% down 17 basis points from the third quarter. Our tax exempt municipal portfolio
averaged about $8.4 billion during the fourth quarter, flat with the third quarter with a taxable equivalent yield of
4.01% down 3 basis points from the prior quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, 78% of our municipal portfolio
was pre-refunded or PSF insured, and the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter was
4.4 years down slightly from the 4.5 years at the end of the third quarter.
Regarding our non-interest expense outlook for 2022, our projected expense growth in 2022 over our 2021 full
year reported non-interest expenses is in the high single digits impacted by our expansion efforts and salary
pressures. The impact of our Houston and Dallas expansions is responsible for about 2% of the growth, cost
associated with reintroducing our residential mortgage product adds about 1.5% and increasing our minimum
wage from $15 per hour to $20 per hour in December as a result of salary pressures across the state is
responsible for about 2% of the projected growth in non-interest expenses in 2022. Just to talk a little bit about
current loan and deposit volumes, as you've seen in our press release and as Phil mentioned, we saw really good
strong loan growth excluding PPP in the fourth quarter, both on an average and period end basis. As we've
moved into January, I just want to confirm that that strong growth has continued both on average and on a period-
end basis. On the deposit side, we also saw strong deposit growth in the fourth quarter. On an average and
period-end basis and the growth came both from demand deposits and interest-bearing deposits. I was expecting
that we might see a seasonal drop in deposits in January, but up to this point, that has not occurred. Regarding
the estimates for full year 2022 earnings, our current projections assume three 25 basis point Fed rate increases
this year with one in May, one in July and the last one in December, and thus having no material impact that last
one on our projected net interest income in 2022. But those rate assumptions and the expected 2022 – 2022

expense growth that I previously mentioned, we currently believe that the current mean of analysts' estimates of
$5.88 for 2022 is low.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

Brady Gailey Q

So if I back out the PPP loan shrinkage, I see period-end loan growth just in the fourth quarter of over 20% when
quarter annualized are at very, very strong level. Maybe just some commentary about where you saw a lot of that
loan growth happen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A

Yeah, it's...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
It's really across the board, Brady to be quite honest with you. It's – we're seeing good growth both in C&I, CREs,
good. Really all categories are good. We did see some increase in energy as well. That's impacting it. So if I
looked at that annualized growth, energy added about 1%, not materially – not material to that annualized number
that you mentioned, but it's pretty much across the board.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. And then I think last quarter, you guys had about $13 million of PPPs left. You're now saying it's $3
million. So is it safe to assume that end of fourth quarter you realized PPPs at about $10 million in 4Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, let me grab that real quick here. Yeah, it's about – I'm seeing a number – just on the fee side, it's about $8
million. So if you included the interest on it, it's probably in that $9 million range, but I am showing about $8.4
million in the quarter related to those fees.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. All right. And then we saw the bond portfolio expand in the fourth quarter. So if you look at the 10-year
bond yield is now 180 basis points, so it's even higher than where it was then. How should we think about the
possibility of Frost continuing to grow the bond book this year in 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, what we've said, Brady all along is that it's our – it was our intent to continue to invest. We like to be
opportunistic; I'm going to be honest, the deposit growth that we saw it's just really been incredible, I kind of
expected that the fourth quarter might be a little bit softer, I probably said that in the third quarter as well. And so
we've been able to make a lot of these investment purchases that we made in 2021 without really having a
significant impact on our balances at the Fed. This morning I think when I got an update, I think we're north of $14
billion still today after the purchases that I talked about. So, still pretty strong. I think from a projection standpoint
we're assuming that we probably have purchases in the neighborhood of half of that – that $14 billion, if you will.
Again, we're going to be opportunistic, but that's a current thought.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right, and those are just purchases, you'll have obviously bonds that are rolling off. So, that's just on the
purchase side is what you're saying.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Right. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I think – I think on the – yeah, I was going to see if I had the maturities here. I think what I'm saying is that
we've got about $2 billion scheduled in maturities and assumptions on prepayments for the year.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, so half of $14 billion is $7 billion. You take away $2 billion, that's going to be rolling off. So maybe think
about the bond book growing roughly $5 billion in 2022. Does that seem fair.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I don't think you're off base, again what we've said is we're going to look at what's going on in the market
and we'll take a look at what's going on in deposits if these deposits continue to stick. You know we could be
more opportunistic, but that's kind of where I'm thinking right now. We're early in the year. Obviously, the ALCO
Group meets – meets monthly, so we'll just decide from there. But I don't think you're too far off base with that.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hi, good afternoon. How much of your loan growth this year do you think is going to come from the expansion in
Houston and Dallas? And do you think the Dallas branch expansion could be – you've raised the Houston branch
count more than, I think originally projected. Do you think you could do the same for Dallas at some point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, let's see, Jerry might have some a few on the on loan growth from the Houston. I mean it's – I think I gave
the numbers, and I may be able to pull up in a second where we stood at the end of the year, I think loans were

Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
just a little under $500 million. Deposits were a little under $700 million really round numbers. But I think Dallas is
going to be solid. I don't have any reason to believe that they will perform worse than Houston. You know, we look
it's early. We opened our first branch there. I should say we opened up a location before we had begun working
on before we announced the strategy. We call it Red Bird location in the southern sector. Dallas has been really
successful. And so that's the first example I have of boots on the ground there and how we do with the new
location. So that's been really good. I just think the character of Dallas is such that it is a very much of a business
centric market. I think once upon a time someone told me they were 10,000 corporate headquarters there. It's not
nearly as energy centric as the Houston market. That can be a good thing and a bad thing. But it is a I think it is
just a more diverse market in many ways. And so I've always been excited about the prospects for Frost Bank in
Dallas because middle market, small business commercial is our wheelhouse. And man, that is a target rich
environment. So if we just do the right things learn the lessons that we learned from Houston. I'm real I have no
reason to believe we won't be successful in the Dallas market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Jennifer, I can quantify some sort of numbers just to give you perspective, fourth quarter to fourth quarter I don't
have the link in front of me, but so if we exclude the PPP loans, the loans were up about 2.4%. So that was about
$350 million about a little north of 1% of that actually came from the Houston expansion. So again, they're starting
from small numbers. But if they're contributing that sort of growth on the change, if you will, they were responsible
for a significant part of the growth.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
I just wanted to start on NII, you talked about a lot of moving parts with rate hikes and you've got cash deployment
and securities that you're expecting. That sounds like that's going to be pretty meaningful this year.
Can you just remind us first, maybe what is the impact on NIM or NII from each 25 basis point rate hike that you're
looking at this year? And then just bigger picture what you're thinking on the total NII trend versus 2021. That'd be
great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. So maybe an easy way to say it is the impact of the net interest of the rate hike, each 25 basis point rate
hike is about a $1 million for a month for the first 25 and so because of some of the floors, they'll come into play.
They don't come – they're impacting that growth in the first hike. By the second hike, that number – most of them
are eliminated. And so I would say that number is closer to a $1.7 million say a month. That'll give you some
perspective there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q

And then just overall for NII growth in 2022 versus 2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I mean yeah, we're projecting obviously we've got a lot of positive things going for us. You know, so if
you've got to take out PPP, of course because if you include PPP, we're going to find some pressure there. I'd say
with, let me hold on, grab my notes here real quick.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, it is going to be it could be pretty substantial, just given as you said the assumptions that we're talking
about and some of it's going to be impacted by the timing. As you heard I said our first assumption for a rate hike
is in May, if it happens sooner that'll help us. But we're talking for – we're talking with a certainly a double digit sort
of mid-teen potential growth for us on a TE basis year-over-year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. And that's factoring in again the net $5 billion in growth in securities and then which are you expecting on

That's all-in, good. And what are you guys factoring in for deposit growth for this year? Because that, I guess will
drive, but maybe won't drive that much because you've got enough cash to deploy in securities. I was just curious

Yeah. To be honest, we're – it's been interesting, I've kind of expected that the deposits might slow down some of
their growth, as I've said, and it's been pretty solid in the last couple of quarters. You know, our growth
assumptions are that that's somewhat softer in 2022 I can envision that. And again, I might be eating my words a
year from now. But at this point, I don't envision that we'll be seeing a 20% or we're not assuming we'll see a 20%
year-over-year average growth in deposit. If we do, it'll be great. As Phil mentioned, we're doing a lot to enhance
new customer relationships. The one thing I was really happy to see on the deposit side and continue to be happy
to see is we do our 12-month look back on deposit growth? And for the last 12 months, about one third of our
growth is coming from new relationships with two thirds of that then coming from customer augmentation. That
number is really the split between new and augment – existing augmentation is really skewing slowly, more and
more to the new relationship. So, we continue to be happy about that and that could impact the growth. But at this
point, on a full year average, I'm thinking we're going to be much softer than where we were in 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah, that makes sense. And maybe just one last one on the non-interest income side, you had some good
growth in 2021 I was just curious what your thoughts are if you're expecting sort of a similar pace of growth on a
core basis or if it should accelerate for any reason.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I think the pressure that I'll go through the pressures first, the pressure we're having is on the deposit
service charge. You know we put in the overdraft grace product as we've talked about quite a bit really happy with
that product. There continues to be obviously things that we're doing to continue to look at OD fees and what
makes sense and what doesn't make sense. So I don't expect that we'll see a potential for a lot of growth there so
some pressure there. On the insurance side, I think the pressures that I see there are more on the contingent
income side. So we have a pretty big. And you can see in our numbers, I don't have them in front of me, but a
good piece of our business there is contingent income associated with how those policies perform. Let me see if I
can grab it here in front of me, but I'm expecting that that's going to be softer. So we had about 3 – it looks like
$3.2 million in in 2021. If you recall, we had a freeze here in Texas in February that would pretty much stop the
state for a few days. So there were quite a few claims there. So I'm expecting there'll be quite a bit of pressure on
that contingent income line item in 2022. But we are excited about our trust area. They had good growth there.
Obviously, the markets have helped us. We had good growth in oil and gas fees, which are dependent on what
happens in oil prices. But we're optimistic, especially as we add new customers. I think there's a good potential
there. I don't think we – it'd be great if the market expectations or the market returns in 2022 look like 2021. But
that's kind of not making sense right now. So it might be a little bit pressure there as well.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Great, thank you. I was curious if the REITs come in higher than what you're expecting. So for instance, if we get
a rate hike in March, and that would lead to higher net interest income. The question is, would you let most of the
benefit fall to the bottom-line or would there be any type of plans to maybe accelerate some of your branch
expansion investments is kind of like a partial offset?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, not really. You know, the timing of the branches, there's a lot involved in that, right, because we need to make
sure that we find the locations. You've got to hire the right people. That's such an important part of the success as
we know. And so in some ways, we really wouldn't be able to accelerate that expansion. What I would say is that
regarding our deposit betas, we're pretty conservative, I'll say in our assumptions on deposit betas on the interest
bearing side. And I think the last numbers I saw, we had deposit betas of say 50% in our assumptions.
Historically, when we went back and looked at, cycles and, 17% to 19%, for example, we were probably closer to
30%, 35%. So, there – it'll be interesting to see what happens what we've said and is that we always want to
make sure that we're offering a square deal to our customers. We'll be looking at market rates, not only against
the too big to fail, but who our competitors are. And so we'll react on the deposit side if the industry as a whole,
doesn't raise rates. You know, we could have bigger benefits than you know, but over time we're going to see
increases in deposits, just given where the market takes us, deposit costs,
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

...raising deposit rates. I'm just curious, just given so much deposits that you have today, what – what's the
thought of that type of strategy this time around?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
You know, Peter, I guess you – I think you know us and you know us well, I mean we're really all about the
customer relationship, we want to make sure that that we provide our customers with a square deal, so we want
to make sure that that the rates that we're offering are competitive and to the extent that that there are rates that
we feel we need to move even with a loan to deposit ratio under 40. You know we're going to raise those rates
because we think it's fair. It's important for us to try to continue to build those relationships and make sure that
we're offering our customers a square deal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
You know, Peter last time in 2017, you saw the Fed rate move up in rates 100 basis points and the thing that
happened to us is we focus so much on competing with the too big to fail here in these markets that, our eyes
were squarely on what they were doing competitively, and they really didn't move at all at that point. And so we
sort of decided to break away from it at that time. I'll say this time around, we have learned from that experience,
and Jerry and his team and our deposit teams have really been very diligent, I think in paying attention to what
rates are it regardless of what some of the larger competitors might be doing. And I think we've done a nice job. I
know we have on the CD rates, for example and there really has been much movement in the non-maturity
portfolio rates. But we've moved some on that. I feel really good about where we are. I think we've got a much
better start going into this rate cycle moving up than we had in 2017. So we're not really playing from behind the
curve right now. And so I feel pretty good about it. You know like I say, I think we learned from our experience
back in 2017.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
All right. If I could just quick housekeeping questions. Just other income if I take out the branch sale gain, it was
still pretty elevated relative to third quarter. I'm just wondering. Anything unusual in other income?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
I wanted to start Jerry to follow up on the high single digit expense growth guide for 2022. Just given where wage
pressure and inflation has been trending for everyone do you think at least at this stage it looks like that would be
maybe at the upper end of a high single digit range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
And does it help if I say, I hope it is? No, let me say I'm going to say that that just to be clear, we continue to see
salary pressure. You know we're out to get and keep attract and keep the best people that we can. And so we're
going to do what we need to do to be competitive. So it probably would be a little bit premature for me to say that,
but I will say that I don't want to mislead you. We are – we continue to feel salary pressure. We're having
conversations all the time to be quite honest with you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
So yeah, I would be flippant to maybe say, yeah, we've taken care of the problem because it's something that,
that we're facing every day.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Okay. That's fair. And then on the loan side, with every bank right sitting on a ton of liquidity, just like you
guys, everybody is focused on loans. Could you give us a sense how competitive is the lending environment
today? Are you walking away from even more loan opportunities over structure? And what is the loan outlook for
2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
You know, I wouldn't say, Steven, it's more competitive. It's really competitive and has been. You know, I think
that we – if you look at what was lost to structure, I'm trying to look here, three months ago versus now. So we
lost 64% of the deals this quarter, the fourth quarter, to structure. And in the prior quarter, we lost 68% of the
deals to structure. So it's actually been fairly consistent. You know, if you look a year ago though, we lost 56% of
the deals to structure, 44% to rate. So, we're competing aggressively on price. And I think that's the right thing for
us to do. By the time someone passes our credit criteria and relationship and character at all those elements that
go into underwriting it. You know it's – and given the cost of goods sold related to deposits, which I'll argue for us
are as low as anybody I know about. There's no reason for us to be losing business over a few basis points. so I
want us to be competitive on that. And let's engage with somebody and have a long term relationship. I think it
works out for us very well. But it's – man, it's been competitive. It continues to be. You know I saw – I was asking
our people about in the real estate markets, what's going on, you're seeing interest rates go up some, you look at
cap rates, they haven't moved in some cases. For some credits, they've gone down. Others tons of capital still
available looking for high quality, low risk deals. And so it's not been great, but it's the same. I'm proud of the way
that our people are competing and the kind of customer relationships we have and the kind of deal flow that we're
that we're bringing in. So I think we're doing a good job competing. But we're also you I've said a 1 million times
there's no green pasture on the other side of the fence of great credit quality. It might look good, but it is a
15


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
wasteland out there. And so we're still focused on maintaining our disciplines and we'll be competitive. But we're
not going to be I can say we're not going to – we'll try not to be stupid about it. How about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So when you think about 2022 is this a high single digit year for loan growth? Is that what you're thinking I don't
want to put words in your mouth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, I think those are my words, I feel good about high single digit growth this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
You know, we'll have – everybody's fighting this thing, Steven, on commercial real estate pay-offs, right? Because
with rates beginning to move up, you're seeing some people accessing long term markets maybe sooner than
they would. I talked about cap rates. People are worried about them going up. They might be taking advantage of
prices out there. So you could see some deals payoffs more than you've seen. But the other thing is our advance
rates on liquidity lines, working capital lines is up a little bit. It's up a little bit from the previous quarter. I think we
were like around 32% this year, excuse me this quarter and it used to be around a little over 38%. So, there's
room there if supply chain things clear up some and maybe that offset some of that. So but we're just competing
well, and we're seeing relationships grow. And we've got what's going on in Houston and Dallas will take a little
while to move the needle. But it's going to. So I'm just optimistic about how it's going.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. maybe just one final question. Even though many in our industry think the branch is dead. How
important has it been having a physical branch in your new markets to those growth metrics and consumer
checking accounts you mentioned? And could you have pulled that off without a physical branch just with direct
digital advertising, et cetera? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I'll give you a number, Steven 87% of the account growth are the relationship growth we've had in Houston
has come within five miles of a branch. I'd say it matters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.

Hey, Jon.

Hey, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just one quick follow-up on expenses. You know, you gave us the components of Houston, Dallas Residential
and then minimum wage. Is the rest of it just compensation, or is there anything else in there to call out in terms of
the increases?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I would say that really, it's related to the base in 2021 so. Some of the things that we're doing, as it relates to – are
starting to meet more with customers. So, I'm seeing increases and things that you would expect like meals, travel
and entertainment as we start continuing to do some of that prospecting face to face. I saw some, some good
sized increases in advertising marketing as well, as we continue to make sure that we're doing what we need to
be doing there. And then, yeah, we're obviously going to feel, as you're saying, some continued salary pressure.
So I would say those in my mind are the major components.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then kind of a follow-up on Peter's question. Are there areas where you would like to spend more in
the business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yes. Yeah. You come talking to a couple of sidewalks, I guess we don't like to spend more, I think we – but we
do, we should do. I'll tell you the things that we're doing. You're going to – you're going to – as it relates to the
legacy business, we're pretty careful with expenses. I mean, Jerry's pointed that out. And I think if you peel back
all the PPE and you peel back expansion, you peel back our mortgage expansion, our numbers are pretty, pretty
conservative there. So, I wouldn't say we like to spend money. That's not exactly what you said but I wouldn't say
we'd like to do that, but we will spend money and we will invest. We're going to continue to do this, and one needs
to know it. We'll continue to invest in expanding our business. So if you look at things that we'll invest and we're
17


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
going to continue expanding on this organic growth strategy there's a great payoff in it. And it comes closer and
closer to that harvesting phase of these new locations every year. So we're going to do that.
We're going to continue to invest in our people. Jerry talked about what we've been seeing there. I'll talk to you
about how we went to a $20 minimum wage. You know we're investing in our people, there's a lot of other things
like that. We're paying a lot bigger share of our medical premiums than we were a year ago. And we're going to
continue to invest in technology. I really am extremely proud of our technology and what we're able to do and our
strategy that we're – that we've employed there. You know we've – if you look at our apps ratings really high, as
you know we do our own web development, we do our own digital development. We have lots of flexibility and
ability to have a great customer experience and a branded experience there. So I don't feel because we've been
willing to do this. I don't feel we're playing from behind the curve in technology. Yes, it's a ton of money. We spend
more there seems like any other place, but we're not playing from behind the curve. You know the things that
we're doing, I think are moving us forward and it's really exciting to see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. One more thing you mentioned Houston and energy a couple of times can you just touch on your appetite
for energy lending in general?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
It's we've got an appetite for it, but it's kind of like that going on keto diet. You know you want to get down to that
weight loss level and then once you get there you can normalize your diet. But we've said we want to get down to
mid-single digits. We're almost there. We're 6.6%. But what I want to point out is that's still a really big part of our
portfolio. It's one of the top segments of the portfolio. So we're not moving out of that business. We're just getting
to where we need to be on a prudent level. The thing I'm really proud of our people for doing is that we're on the
deals that we are engaging in now and prospecting. We're doing it on the basis that we've always underwritten
things and we're being disciplined about it, and that's good, it doesn't work for everyone, but it works for the right
kind of customer. You know the way I think about that business is, I've always thought about it kind of like a
multifamily construction business, right? I mean we can do as much multifamily construction lending as we
wanted to. We could take that loan to deposit ratio and get it wherever you want it over the next year, right? But
that's not the right thing for us to do. It is an important asset class to us. But we do it a certain way and we do it
with people that we are familiar with and have had great relationships with or have wanted to have great
relationships with. And does it work for every deal for everyone? No, it doesn't. But those customers that do
business with us they know what we'll do. And they know what works with us and they like to do business with us.
We're not going to do every deal for everybody. But we do a lot of deals for them. And I see that being the same
thing and same approach we take in the energy business, won't work for everyone the way we do it. But we're
going to do it in such a way that when energy prices move down and they will, it's a commodity business. We
don't want our shareholders losing sleep about it. I sure they don't want to lose sleep about it. And we're going to
be underwritten in a way that we feel good about it. And there are ways you can do that well, and that's what
we're focused on. And it's not going to be such a large level that Cullen/Frost becomes the next easy short when
energy prices start moving down.
