Good afternoon to those in Hong Kong and great to see you all. Good morning to those watching in London and
around the world. Before George takes you through the Q4 numbers, I'll make some opening comments. First, I'm
really pleased with the performance that the team delivered in 2023. We reported $30 billion of PBT for the first
time ever, and we delivered a return on tangible equity of 14.6% or 15.6%, excluding material notable items.

Second, there were some items in the fourth quarter which make it harder to understand the underlying
performance. George will take you through them in detail, but I want to stress there was still good underlying
growth in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of notable items and Argentina hyperinflation, our profit before
tax was $7.3 billion.
Third, we distributed $19 billion of capital returns to our shareholders in respect of 2023. This included a full year
dividend of $0.61 per share, which is the highest since 2008, and $7 billion of share buybacks, which have
reduced the share count by over 4% at completion of the current buyback.
Fourth, we still expect to have substantial distribution capacity going forward. We've announced a further share
buyback of up to $2 billion. We're committed to considering a special dividend of $0.21 per share as a priority use
of the Canada proceeds subject to the completion of the transaction. And we finished the year with a strong CET1
ratio of 14.8%, which will be further boosted by the Canada deal.
Fifth, we remain committed to cost discipline. We have flow through impacts of 2023 inflation on our cost this
year, but expect a downward trend in inflationary pressures in 2025 and beyond. We continue to invest in growth
opportunities and the digitization of our business to drive incremental efficiencies. We remain very focused on
funding much of that investment through cost saving initiatives.
Finally, we expect to have further opportunities to grow revenue even in a lower rate environment. George will
take you through how we are reducing our sensitivity to rate movements and we do acknowledge the downside
risk to NII, but we're confident that we have the levers for growth that allow us to deliver mid-teen returns in 2024.
I'll take you through some of these levers later. But let me now hand over to George.

Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Noel. A warm welcome to everyone here in Hong Kong. For those of you watching in London, good
morning and thank you for joining our full year 2023 results call. We delivered a good underlying business
performance in the fourth quarter, but let me first start by clarifying that our reported profit before tax was
impacted by $5.8 billion of notable items and a further $0.5 billion from Argentina hyperinflation, including the
more than 50% devaluation of the peso in December.
Let me unpack three of those notable items. First, we reinstated the impairment on the sale of our France retail
business as signaled at the third quarter. Second, we booked a $0.4 billion of Treasury disposal losses in the
quarter, again in line with the guidance at the third quarter to extend the duration of hedges in anticipation of rate
decreases.
And finally, as you know, each quarter, we conduct a value and use test on the carrying value of our investment in
BoCom described in detail in our annual report and accounts. Following the outcomes of that test in Q4, we took a
charge of $3 billion in the quarter against our carrying value. The charge had an insignificant impact on CET1
capital and our CET1 ratio, and no impact on our dividends or share buyback. And just to be clear, this has no
impact on our strategy in Mainland China, has no impact on our strategic relationship with BoCom, and it has no
impact on HSBC's or BoCom's operation strategy or outlook.
So on a reported basis, our profit before tax was $1 billion in the fourth quarter, down $4 billion from the fourth
quarter of 2022. Excluding the $6.3 billion impact of notable items and Argentina hyperinflation, our profit before
tax was $7.3 billion, up $0.7 billion versus the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to growth in banking NII.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2024
On the next slide, so on a reported basis, fourth quarter revenue was down $1.6 billion compared to the same
period last year due to the impact of notable items and Argentina hyperinflation. Excluding these, our revenue
was up $1.5 billion, primarily banking NII. The strength of our deposit franchise, our access to two deep pools of
liquidity in the UK and Hong Kong, and our enviable balance sheet made it possible for us to benefit from the
more favorable rate environment.
On the next slide, fourth quarter NII and banking NII were again impacted by Argentina hyperinflation and a
reclassification of cash flow hedge revenue between NII and non-NII. Excluding these, both NII and banking NII
were broadly stable on the third quarter and then was down 3 basis points primarily due to higher time deposit
costs and deposit migration in Hong Kong.
Turning to the outlook, taking our fourth quarter banking NII and adjusting for Argentina hyperinflation and the
reclassification of cash flow hedge revenue, and the disposal of our France retail and Canada businesses gives
you an annualized run rate of just above $43 billion. That should be your starting point for modeling our 2024
banking NII.
We expect four key variables to drive our banking NII from that starting point in 2024. Changes in interest rates,
the reinvestment of maturing structural hedge assets at higher yield, deposit migration, particularly here in Hong
Kong, and balance sheet movements. There is a degree of uncertainty inherent in all of this. We're guiding
towards the banking NII of at least $41 billion in 2024.
This is our current estimate of the bottom end of the range of reasonable outcomes and is intended to help you
with your modeling. We will continue updating further as the year unfolds. And before turning to non-NII, I'd like to
direct your attention to the chart on the bottom right of this slide. Over the last 18 months, our banking and NII
sensitivity has reduced by around $3.5 billion.
More than one-third of this reduction is due to increased structural interest rate hedging. Subject to market
conditions, we expect to increase both the notional and the duration of our structural hedge in the coming quarters
in order to reduce our banking NII sensitivity still further. Non-NII was down $0.9 billion compared to the same
quarter last year due to notable items and Argentina hyperinflation, and again, excluding these, non-NII was up
$1.7 billion versus the same quarter last year. This was primarily due to the revenue offset into non-NII from the
central cost of funding, global banking and markets trading activity, which is included in banking NII earned from
the cash flow hedge income reclassification between NII and non-NII I referred to previously. Other non-NII was
up modestly versus the same quarter last year, including an increase of $0.1 billion in net fee income, primarily in
Commercial Banking and Wealth and Personal Banking.
Looking at non-NII from our two strategic activities of wholesale transaction banking and wealth. In wholesale
transaction banking, non-NII was up 2% on the fourth quarter of 2022. There was good growth in global payment
solution and trade and in foreign exchange, reflecting the strength of our international network and transaction
banking capabilities, as well as increased client activity and repricing initiatives. This was partly offset by a
relatively small decrease in security services.
In wealth, non-NII in both asset management and private banking grew by double-digits versus the fourth quarter
of last year due to an increase in assets under management, partly driven by net new invested assets. However,
total wealth non-NII was down $0.1 billion as a result of a $0.2 billion correction to historical valuation estimates in
our insurance business. For the full year, non-NII in wholesale transaction banking was $10.6 billion, up 5% on
2022 and $6 billion in wealth, up 7%.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2024
Turning now to credit. Our fourth quarter ECL charge was $1 billion primarily in wholesale. This brought our full
year ECL charge to $3.4 billion, which was 33 basis points of average customer loans, including those held for
sale or 36 basis points excluding those, and within our full year 2023 guidance. Due to ongoing macroeconomic
uncertainty, we're guiding towards ECLs of around 40 basis points for 2024.
We took an ECL charge of $0.2 billion for Mainland China commercial real estate in the fourth quarter as part of
the $1 billion charge for the quarter referenced in the last slide. This brought the full year charge on this portfolio
to $1 billion, crystallizing the plausible downside scenario that we set out last February. Our main area of focus
remains the portfolio booked in Hong Kong, that exposure is now $6.3 billion, down $1.2 billion in the quarter, and
down $3.1 billion compared to full year 2022. We continue to monitor the sector closely and we are comfortable
with our current level of provisions.
Turning to cost. Full year 2023 costs on a constant currency basis were down 1%, on a target basis, full year
2023 costs came in 1% higher than our Q3 guidance, driven by three items that unexpectedly landed in the fourth
quarter. First, the FDIC special assessment, which we expected to be incurred over 2024 and 2025. Second, the
UK bank levy was higher than forecast, primarily due to adjustments relating to prior years. And third, there was
an offsetting benefit from Argentina hyperinflation in the quarter.
Looking ahead, we are aiming to limit cost growth to around 5% in 2024 on a target basis, which excludes the
reduction in 2024 costs from the France retail and Canada disposals. This will be driven by the flow-through
impact of 2023 inflation to 2024 costs, investment and volume growth, and partly offset by cost saving initiatives.
On the next slide, customer lending and deposits were broadly stable versus the third quarter once you exclude
the sale of our France retail business. Without that, there was $35 billion of deposit growth, of which $27 billion
was in Asia with around half of this in Hong Kong. Deposit growth in Asia benefited from seasonality and we
would expect at least some of that growth to reverse in the course of Q1.
Turning now to capital, our CET1 ratio at the end of 2023 was 14.8%, which was down 0.1 percentage points on
the third quarter. There are three things I'd like to draw your attention to. First, as I said earlier, the BoCom charge
had an insignificant impact on CET1 capital and our CET1 ratio due to the compensating reduction in regulatory
capital threshold deductions, and it had no impact on dividends or share buybacks.
Second, we expect the share buyback announced today to have an impact of around 25 basis points on our
CET1 ratio in the first quarter of 2024. And finally, we expect the Canada sale to generate around 1.2 percentage
points of CET1 in the first quarter of 2024. We remain committed to consider a $0.21 per share special dividend in
the first half of 2024 as a priority use of the sale proceeds, which equates to around 0.5 percentage points of
CET1.
Before I hand back to Noel, I am pleased to share some enhancements that we have made with regard to our
international disclosures. There are two sets of data and Noel will also comment further on them. Starting with our
wholesale business, let me walk you through the data on this slide. In 2023, we generated $33.5 billion of client
revenue across Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets. Of this, $20.4 billion was generated from
multi-jurisdictional clients. By this, we mean clients that bank with us in more than one market.
The charts on the right show that two-thirds of the client revenue we generate from those clients comes from
providing them with services in markets outside their home market where they also bank with us. It is also worth
pointing out that two-thirds of multi-jurisdictional client revenue, or $13.4 billion, was generated from client whose
home market is in the West, with the remaining $7 billion from clients whose home market is in the East. Turning

now to WPB international revenue, more than $10 billion or 40% of our WPB revenue comes from international
customers, around two-thirds of which is generated in Asia.
So, to summarize, both the wholesale and WPB client revenue data clearly demonstrates the strength of our
international network and our unique capability to serve international clients. Our network and further investments
into our international proposition position us to capture an even greater share of this vital, fast-growing segment.
Let me now hand back to Noel.

Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Georges. Thank you, Georges. You've just heard about good underlying performance in the fourth
quarter and George has introduced more detail, information about our international revenue. Our wholesale
international business model is a mature and differentiated business model with substantial scale, and in recent
years we have started to develop and invest in our WPB international business model. What Georges' slide
showed is that already 40% of WPB revenue comes from international customers, and we believe we can take it
much further.
So let me now turn to how we will drive revenue growth not just this year and next but over the next three to four
years. As always, I'll begin with our purpose, ambition, strategy and values. These have helped to drive the good
underlying business growth, which, alongside supportive interest rates, have given us strong momentum. In the
short term, we're conscious of the potential downside risk to NII. The structural hedging we have put in place will
help to protect that income. But we do have some clear focus areas under our four strategic pillars, which I will
cover on the following slides.
Starting with focus and our international wholesale business, which remains our biggest competitive advantage
and, because of its scale, our biggest growth opportunity, in the past, our businesses in the West were primarily
focused on domestic clients. Over the last four years, we have repositioned those businesses to align them with
our international strategy, exiting low-return and low-growth domestic RWAs. The result is the differentiated model
you see today.
In Commercial Banking, we are unique in our ability to serve clients across multiple geographies, which is what
HSBC was founded to do. The result was the $13.3 billion of profit before tax that Commercial Banking generated
last year. In Global Banking and Markets, I believe we are uniquely positioned to connect clients between West
and East, which was evident in our market-leading performances in markets like the Middle East and businesses
like global foreign exchange.
We have clearly got a strong international franchise. As you can see, we facilitated more than $850 billion of trade
last year, with the diversification of supply chains leading to revenue growth opportunities for HSBC. We ranked
second globally by revenue in our payments business and processed around $500 trillion of electronic payments,
and we've been number three globally by revenue in FX since 2021.
But I believe there is significant amount of untapped opportunity still to go for which can drive revenue growth in
the face of declining interest rates. Importantly, this potential revenue growth is not necessarily dependent on
GDP as that growth opportunity already exists within our client base and it is often fee-based and strongly
influenced by opportunities that are inherent to our – international nature of our client base.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2024
To provide some evidence of this growth potential, we grew wholesale multi-jurisdictional client revenue by 29%
in 2023, and the revenue multiplier for multi-jurisdictional corporate clients in Commercial Banking was five times
that of an average domestic-only customer. I'm pleased that international isn't just a wholesale story. We are
doing more with our WPB customers as well.
Building our Wealth business to meet the rising demand for wealth management services especially here in Asia
has been a strategic priority in recent years, so I'm pleased that we attracted net new invested assets of $84
billion last year compared to $80 billion in 2022 and $64 billion in 2021. This is a good indicator of future revenue
opportunities, which again is often fee income, and should benefit in a lower interest rate environment as
investors shift from cash reserves into invested asset classes.
Another trend is the growing demand for seamless cross-border banking services. Innovation is key here and we
hadn't innovated enough in this space in the past, which meant we weren't offering our customers what they
wanted. But we are now. Global Money has more than 1.3 million customers, up from 550,000 a year ago. We
also launched a new, strengthened international banking proposition. Overall, we grew revenue from WPB
international customers by 41% last year from $7.2 billion to $10.2 billion.
And while you might assume this was driven solely by higher rates, I'm pleased to say there was a 43% jump in
new-to-bank International WPB customers last year. Again, these are higher revenue-generating customers,
bringing in three times as much revenue as an average domestic-only customer.
Next is the continued growth in our two home markets. Our leading propositions in Hong Kong and the UK
provide us with deep liquidity and a differentiated proposition. These two pools of liquidity underpin our
exceptionally strong balance sheet, which gives us the safety and security that our clients trust us to provide.
Hong Kong and the UK are both highly connected global financial centers. We have increased our market-leading
share of trade finance in Hong Kong by 6.6 percentage points over the last three years. This included a 2.4-
percentage-point increase last year alone. We are also ideally positioned to capitalize as the mass affluent
population in Hong Kong and Mainland China continues to grow, driven by rapid urbanization across Mainland
China and the increased use of the Connect Schemes between Mainland China and Hong Kong.
We grew new-to-bank retail customers in Hong Kong by 36% over the last three years, including by capitalizing
on the significant increase of visitors from Mainland China post-reopening. In the UK, we also have good traction
in Commercial Banking. In 2023, we were the number one bank for UK large corporates, as well as the best bank
in the UK for SMEs according to Euromoney. And we are continuing to grow in Wealth and Personal Banking. We
attracted over 1 million new-to-bank customers in the UK last year, and we've had steady mortgage growth,
increasing our market share of UK stock to 8%. As economic conditions improve and we continue to invest, we're
re confident in our ability to grow our business further in these critical areas.
Next, I showed a slide like this last year to demonstrate how we've gone from a business that depended on our
home markets for the vast majority of our profits while the rest of the franchise underperformed to one with broad-
based profitability across markets. This slide shows the increasing profitability of these diversified growth
opportunities. The number one ranking speak for themselves, and I especially want to call out the great work that
the Global Banking and Markets team are doing in the Middle East.
They now topped these rankings three years in a row in a region that presents significant growth opportunities
going forward. India, Mainland China excluding associates, and Singapore all contributed more than $1 billion of

profits in 2023 with Singapore doing so for the first time. This underlines why HSBC was named Best Bank in Asia
by Euromoney, but there was strong growth across all these markets.
The next slide underlines that we have reshaped our portfolio to reinforce strengths while exiting areas of
underperformance and/or lower strategic priority. Over the last 12 months, we've announced exits in a number of
our smaller markets. This is one way that we expect to take out further costs alongside our continued focus on
improving the internal efficiency of the bank. And by making savings, we can invest in the areas on the left that
help us to drive growth.
Before I move on, I want to mention SVB UK. Everyone knows that HSBC is an international bank, but we also
have a long history of supporting innovative entrepreneurs and the acquisition of SVB UK enabled us to build a
bigger proposition and can help us to become known as the go-to bank for innovation companies. It's encouraging
that Innovation Banking had its best-ever quarter for customer onboarding in the fourth quarter of 2023. I'm also
encouraged by how many of those innovative companies want to take their capabilities cross-border.
The next slide sets out how we're investing in technology to make customer experiences better so our process is
more efficient and our cost of execution lower. I'm pleased to see more of our Personal and Corporate customers
are mobile and digitally active. HSBC has traditionally grown by cross-selling products to our existing banking
clients, but innovation also enables us to open up growth avenues that are beyond our traditional customer
footprint.
Zing is one such growth avenue because it offers cross-border payment capabilities, but critically, it is targeted at
non-HSBC customers. Our embedded finance joint venture announced with Tradeshift last year is another such
growth avenue. It's still early days for both but they will allow us to break outside of the existing business model.
I will also briefly cover our final two pillars. There isn't a conversation I have with a client where the net zero
transition doesn't come up. Our first net zero transition plan shows how we intend to finance and support the
transition to net zero and collaborate globally to help enable change at scale. It will be a complex journey but we
have exactly the right geographic footprint where the need and opportunity are greatest.
Finally, energize, over the last four years, we've increased the pace of execution across the organization. The
management team is confident about the business, but it's even more important that our colleagues are confident
because when they are, we stand a much greater chance of succeeding. So I'm pleased that our 2023 staff
survey showed the number of colleagues seeing the positive impacts of our strategy was up 11 percentage points
from 2020 to 73%. And I'm also very excited by the number of quality new hires we've been able to bring into the
organization over the last 12 months. It's also a vote of confidence in our strategy and the momentum we have
built over the last four years.
In summary, I will go back to what I said at the start, I'm really pleased with how we performed in 2023 and the
contribution that our people made. We reported $30 billion of PBT for the first time and a mid-teens RoTE. There
was good underlying growth in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impacts of notable items and Argentina
hyperinflation, our profit before tax was $7.3 billion.
We distributed $19 billion of capital returns to our shareholders in respect of 2023. This included the best full-year
dividend since 2008 and three share buybacks, and we still expect to have substantial distribution capacity going
forward. We remain committed to cost discipline and we expect a further opportunities to grow revenue even in a
lower rate environment. We're confident that we have the levers for growth that allow us to deliver mid-teens
returns in 2024.

sure your camera is and microphone are turned on and wait for the prompt. For the people in the room, please
wait for the microphone and make sure to state your name and the name of your institution before asking your
question. We'll start with questions in the room. Okay, Gurpreet?

Gurpreet Singh Sahi Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC
Thank you. Gurpreet Sahi from Goldman. Two questions, if I may, please. The first one is on FY 2025 and
beyond, we note that – the RoTE guidance for this year, but if there can be any comments regarding the RoTE for
2025 and beyond, in particular, if the banking NII sensitivity for the next 100 basis points of rate cuts can be kind
of guided to us. The second one is around the gain, the implied improvement in the capital from the gain in
Canadian operations, and that remains at around $10 billion, of which $4 billion can be special dividend. So the
$6 billion, have you decided on how much between capital distribution to shareholders and then business growth?
Thank you.

Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Noel. Thanks, Gurpreet. So, we have not at this stage given guidance for full-year 2025. I point you to
the guidance we've given for full-year 2024 of at least $41 billion in banking NII and mid-teens return on tangible
equity. In terms of banking NII sensitivity, we do have a slide at the back end of the deck which I can point you to,
which shows for the further 100 basis point and for future years what's the impact.
What I can point you to is, number one, we continue to intend to increase – subject to market conditions, but as of
today, to increase the structural hedge. Second – the volume of the structural hedge. Second, we continue to
intend to increase the weighted average life of the structural hedge. Having now reached 2.8 years and with the

intent to take it to above 3 years, both of which should give you a sense of how we're mitigating rate impacts into
2024 and 2025 from the structural hedging activity.
With regards gain on Canada, so $10 billion of proceeds, $4 billion will be considered, what we committed to
consider, as a priority use for a special dividend. The residual $6 billion will constitute about 0.8%, 0.9% additional
CET1, which may – which very likely will be at the Q1 outcome. We will continue looking at opportunities, but it
remains our intent – subject to market conditions, our capital position, regulatory position, it remains our intent to
continue a rolling series of share buybacks beyond this one.

Thank you. Any others in the room? Okay. So we'll take – our first question from the line will be from Andrew
Coombs from Citi.

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Andrew, hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Coombs Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Yeah, it's morning from London, good afternoon to yourselves. Two questions, please. Firstly, I just want to clarify
the messaging on the banking NII outlook. If I rewind 12 months ago, I think you gave guidance for greater than
$36 billion of reported NII, but then this time a year ago you said you weren't seeking to move consensus, which
at the time was actually higher, was at $37 billion. If I fast-forward to today, you're guiding to greater than $41
billion. If I look at consensus NII, I adjust the trading book funding costs, it looks like consensus banking NII is
around $44 billion.
So are you seeking to rebase consensus banking NII or should we put greater emphasis on your greater than
within that $41 billion target? So that's my first question, I just want to clarify that messaging. My second question
is around the hedge. Thank you for the extra disclosure on the $478 billion nominal and the 2.8 years average life.
Can you give us an idea of both the average yield on that book and also what it's currently rolling off at and what
you're aiming to roll it back on at if you are extending the duration out? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A

I think George will answer both of those.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A

So thank you, Andrew. So, obviously, today we cannot see consensus banking NII and basically I'll use this
opportunity to ask you, collectively, if you can start giving us your banking NII consensus so we can see the NII
forecasts. And then the funding cost of the trading book gets lumped together with the non-NII and it's, to be fair,
difficult for us to unpack it, although $44 billion does sound high if we try to do the math ourselves.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2024
But let me take a step back and just walk you through how we're thinking about NII. And just bear with me for 2
minutes, but I think that explanation would probably help guide you. So we start from the Q4 $10.7 billion banking
NII. We would adjust then Q4 for the parts related to Argentina hyperinflation as well as the reclassification of the
cash flow hedges between NII and non-NIII. We'll adjust for the part that does not pertain to Q4, so that's a full-
year correction, and that's about an additional $0.5 billion you could use on the Q4 $10.7 billion number.
So that takes you to $11.2 billion adjusted quarterly run rate. Annualized, taking into account day counts, you get
to $44.4 billion. From that $44.4 billion, remember, you have to deduct the full-year French NII, France retail NII,
as well as three quarters from the Canada NII, which together, combined, come to about $1.3 billion. So $44.4
billion minus $1.3 billion takes you to just above $43 billion. That would be our starting position, if you want, in
terms of an annualization of a run rate, factoring in structural hedges, et cetera.
Now, from that $43 billion, there are various tailwinds and headwinds. We have the tailwind of reinvestment of all
the structural hedges from lower rates into the current rate environment. We do have some tailwinds – probably
cautious on H1, but tailwinds beyond H1 in terms of volume growth and loan growth. And we do have headwinds
including the rate cycle if indeed we start seeing the decreases in the second half of the year and we, obviously,
have the headwinds which we we've observed, specifically, Hong Kong around deposit migration to term deposits.
Kind of taking all of that into account, we're getting to the guidance of at least $41 billion that we're comfortable
sharing today.
With regards the structural hedge, we have shared with you volume, we have shared with you the weighted
average life, and we have shared with you now banking NII sensitivity. We have not yet shared and we have not
yet found the level of standard we would need to be able to share the yield, but what I can you about the yield is
that both the yield of the maturing hedges being replaced at current rates as well as the additional hedges we're
doing with inverted curves are all baked into our at least $41 billion banking NII guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So if I could just add a couple of comments, one reason we're not given a statement regarding consensus is, as
George says, we think consensus is a mixture of updated thinking that has adjusted for some of these
annualization effects of disposals and other things, and some consensus hasn't adjusted for that at the moment.
So I think there's a little bit of apples and pears in today's consensus position.
So what George is clearly trying to articulate for you is take the Q4, adjust it for the known items, get to a new
starting position of $43 billion, and [ph] is (00:47:20) underpinned to that starting position of $43 billion with at
least $41 billion. Therefore, the range of modeling is going to be somewhere between $41 billion and $43 billion
depending on the assumptions you might make on the headwinds and the tailwinds. And we think that given that
lack of consistency on consensus, the uncertainty in the market, that's probably the best way to guide you on
banking NII, but there's a very clear repositioning of the starting position to get us back on an apples and apples
basis.
And then the other thing – no, that was it. That's what I wanted to say, those two comments. Thank you.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Katherine Lei Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd.
...questions here. For first questions, I want to clarify, the mid-teen RoTE's guidance is a normalized RoTE, that
means that RoTE excluding Canada disposal gain. So I want to clarify that. Because if that is the case, in mid-
teen RoTEs, then if you look at the company compiled consensus, I think the RoTE is 17.4%. Then I just calculate
that on a very, like top-down basis excluding the disposal gain, then consensus RoTE is roughly about mid-teen
as well.
But the thing is that I think that means that the HSBC guidance and consensus is quite in line in terms of
normalized RoTE. But I think on NII, on costs, NII I think – in the previous questions, I think there may be a bit of
reset in expectation, and then I think cost, the 5% cost is a bit higher than where consensus was indicating. Then
that mean – does it mean that you are quite optimistic on non-NII growth, i.e., fee growth, or maybe you have a
different view on asset quality and hence the ECL charges? I think this is the first part of the big question.
The second part is on BoCom. May I know like what trigger the $3 billion impairment charges? And as China's
yield is declining, like they just announced a 25-basis-point on five-year LPR cut in all those, should we be
expecting more impairments on the BoCom investment? So, basically, I want to see if there is any one time off
events that triggered this impairment or if it is going to be a normalized part of the business.
So I think in the statement, you clearly stated that, that will have no impact on dividend and shareholders' return. I
believe this is related to the $14 billion capital deduction which you have already made on associate, I think that is
primarily BoCom, but can you explain a bit of that mechanism? Because I think today's share price reaction is

partly factoring in the kind of concern that there is a ongoing impairment on BoCom that will affect the company's
ability to deliver shareholders' return. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Great. Two excellent questions and you're going to get two excellent answers from George.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Katherine. So, Katherine, taking them in the order you say is first, mid-teens RoTE is excluding
notable items, therefore, it is excluding the gain on Canada so your calculation is correct. In terms of NII and
costs, so couple of things to share and we recognize the cost assessment. In terms of banking NII, we have given
the guidance here. I just point you, I mentioned it in my earlier speech, but I just point you that our banking NII
sensitivity has reduced more than – by more than half from the full-year 2022 due to, among other parameters,
our structural hedging activity. So, therefore, the rate impact on our banking NII is reduced commensurately.
Equally, we do have some anticipation of volume growth if and when rates start increasing, which is now planned
for H2 and this is why we have some positive outlook for H2. If rates decrease, volume could pick up, subject to
economic conditions, et cetera, but that's the assessment we have made today. And then thirdly, on the non-rate
sensitive earnings, I've called out transaction banking and wealth earlier. Between them, they constitute about
80% of our non-rate sensitive earnings. One has grown 5%, 2023 to 2022, and the other one has grown 7% and,
therefore, we do feel there is momentum in both these areas for continued growth.
And I didn't talk about the residual 20%, but in the residual 20%, capital market activities, for instance, is included,
and again in a different rate environment, we have grounds to believe this can also pick up. So, yes, we are
comfortable with the momentum we have in the revenue. Can I put you on one thing about cost? We called it out,
5% for the 2024 has a flow-through impact from inflation in 2023. 2023 experienced high inflation. There's some
flow-through, some adjustments including wage inflation which we anticipate to do in 2024.
Based on current outlook of inflation, that parameter is easing as we look forward beyond 2024. Without giving
you any guidance for 2025, the inflationary component flow-through into 2025 does look like easing from where
we stand today looking at 2024 outlook for inflation.
If I move on to your second question about BoCom, so this is – we do talk about the value in use model, it's
following the Hong Kong accounting standards, international accounting standards. Without boring you with the
accounting details, the [ph] ARNA (00:53:21) has many pages which we can point you to that explain it. It feeds
into parameters all in the – the essentially in the public domain, including macro data, other factors including
analysts' comments, feeds into the model. But the model is not highly intuitive but the outcome is the outcome,
and we have been consistently applying it for umpteen quarters now and, therefore, will apply it for Q4.
It is very difficult to predict what the model will give us in Q1. We will take into account the information we receive
over the course of Q1 and we will run the model as we do every quarter and consistently apply the outcome.
Finally, capital deduction, I think this is a very important point. Your math, Katherine, is correct. There is about
$14 billion sitting today in our regulatory capital deductions because they sit above our threshold. Therefore, you
could legitimately assume that there is that much of buffer against any impairments we face in our financial
holdings, BoCom being one of them, the other one is insurance. That's the two, essentially, [indiscernible]
(00:54:33). And, therefore, you can legitimately assume that the compensation we would get from any

hypothetical future impairment will be commensurate given the size of our threshold deductions at this stage,
yeah.

Georges Elhedery A

Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph Dickerson Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Yeah. So just cutting to the chase on some of the questions that have come through on the NII guide, I think you
can probably get a sense that there's some reasonable confusion about what the message is for the 2024
baseline. If we work back from your kind of clean mid-teens ROE, you've given us some guidance on cost, you've
given us some guidance on credit, it's kind of getting into a baseline revenue number of about $64 billion. I think
consensus is $63.5 billion or thereabouts. Are you comfortable with that consensus number? Are you seeking to
change that with this guide?
So that is question number one. And question number two is why the focus on banking NII versus total NII?
Because there's going to be, as rates come down, a lot of moving parts on the trading book funding cost dynamic
because indeed, if I look at your Annual Report, you've actually got a benefit coming through in the US [ph] de-
bucket (00:56:25) from rates falling in terms of the aggregate NII. So I guess why are you trying to distinguish
between those two conceptually for us because I think it's – again, it's creating a fair amount of confusion with
investors?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
George?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Noel. Joe, yes, so I recognize your arithmetics and, yes, I agree with your arithmetics. This being said,
I cannot give you guidance on total revenue, otherwise I'll be giving you guidance on our full profitability. But we
recognize your arithmetics. Couple of things just to highlight, if you want, for your consideration. The first one is
our guidance for banking NII is not $41 billion, it's at least $41 billion, factoring in elements of uncertainty that I
called out earlier, that's for full-year 2024.
You do have the building blocks for cost and for ECL, and then the residual part, if you want, of our earnings story
is the non-NII component, excluding the gains from Canada. And as I said earlier about 80% of it is generated
from transaction banking and wealth, both of which do have momentum, both of which are areas where we
continue investing both in terms of digital capabilities and client servicing and in terms of net new invested assets.
And we are excited about the potential of these two businesses and we believe our mid-teens RoTE is not based
on unreasonable growth in these areas, it's based on momentum growth in these areas.
Maybe I can point you to our net new invested assets, $84 billion for the year, up from $80 billion last year, up
from $64 billion the year before, so clearly, we're acquiring new assets. But equally, as you've seen, asset
management, private banking grew double-digit percentage points. That's also partly due to the valuation

increase, so our AUM is also increasing because the underlying valuation is improving, which is therefore the
generator of fees commensurately, subject to market conditions as we go forward.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks. Just on your second point, so we're guiding – we would like to move to banking NII guidance. We
recognize last year, we have moved from NII into a dual guidance of NII and funding cost of the trading book. We
think it is much simpler to look at our overall rate sensitive earnings through banking NII lens.
The kind of shift from one to the other, which is a zero-sum game, so it moves from one to the other, is reflective
of business decisions as regards how much of our funding we would want to give to the trading book based on
various parameters, including opportunities in the trading book as well as opportunities for loan growth. And we
would think that it would be too noisy if we have to really manage both on a separate basis.

Benjamin, hi.

Benjamin Toms Q
Analyst, RBC Europe Ltd.
Morning, both. Thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, on cost of risk, in relation to your guidance of 40 basis
points, is there still a plausible downside to this guidance or does the 40 basis points encapsulate that plausible
downside? And secondly, on loan growth, I know you're cautious on loan growth in the first half of 2024. Do you
expect growth to pick up in half two? But 2024 as a whole, can you just confirm you expect net growth in the
balance sheet? It sounds like you do because you earlier described [ph] volumes (01:00:25) and the potential
tailwind to NII. And could you narrow down how much lending we should expect for growth for this year? Thank
you.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2024
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure. Thank you, Benjamin. So the cost of risk of 40 basis point encapsulates everything we currently foresee in
our balance sheet. We have not communicated a further plausible downside on the China commercial real estate
portfolio booked in Hong Kong because we believe at this stage that, number one, we're well provisioned for this
portfolio after the provisioning that's taken place last year; and number two, we also have less concerns going
forwards on our residual exposure in that portfolio.
I can point you to our exposure, is now at $6.2 billion, that's down $3.1 billion from full-year 2022. So, therefore,
we do not – we have a reduced level of concern. I can walk you through, if needed, the – how well ECL
positioning is in this portfolio, but we're comfortable and no additional concerns than we called out last year. On
the loan growth, yes, our expectations is that as economic conditions continue improving and the interest rate
environment becomes more supportive, we would expect to see loan growth.
We continue to guide on a medium-term basis to mid-single-digit percentage points loan growth and balance
sheet growth. It's very difficult to forecast what H2 will look like, but that is part of our projections.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So I think our view is given the shift in the interest rate cycle and the shift in inflation, we'll start to see more
economic confidence or business confidence, consumer confidence in the second half. We're not expecting
significant growth in the balance sheet in the first half. If you start to see that kick in the second half, you're likely
to see full-year mid-single-digit growth in 2024. You're going to see a proportion of that start to kick in, in the
second half of the year, and then you'll see it kicking in more strongly in 2025 and beyond. So I think in your
modeling, you're probably looking at limited growth in the first half, growth starting come back in the second half.

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. What was the size of the hedge last year? So how much is it that ramped up
this year? And can you give us an idea of what the currency mix of hedges and whether there's any duration
differences between those currencies as well? Secondly, what exactly is in the quarter the cash flow hedged
reclassification, the impact you had from transferring from NII to non-NII, what exactly was that? And then lastly,
the timing of the special dividend post the Canada sale, will it come with Q1 result if the deal is announced prior to
release, or is it not linked to the results [ph] now (01:03:48) and so on? Thanks.

Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, [ph] Robert (01:03:55), the – we've added about $80 billion, more north of $80 billion to our hedge this year in
terms of bond notional, a little bit more in terms of other derivative notional. And that's on top of an $80 billion
we've added over Q4 and starting in Q3 in 2022. So that should give you an idea of also what is the quantum we
could reasonably do in 2024 if the market conditions remain supportive for the hedge.
In terms of duration, I mean, the kind of the obvious one to call out is we can certainly hedge on our weighted
average life for slightly longer currencies such as the pound, the US dollar, to some extent, the euro. We have an
inability to hedge in any reasonable size or shape our – and this is due to structural market, our Hong Kong dollar
exposure. So our Hong Kong dollar exposure hedge would remain much lower and therefore, our exposure in
Hong Kong dollar would remain more sensitive to the rate outlook compared to the other currencies.
In terms of Canada sale, you could expect in Q1 subject to completion which is now, I believe – which is now
planned to be on track to be by the end of Q1, we would expect to see a jump of 1.2%, 1.3% in our CET1 ratio.
The special dividend, which we're committed to consider would happen afterwards. Our best estimate is H1, but
frankly, afterwards, as soon as we can subject all necessary approvals, and that will drop the CET1 by about

0.5% with a resulting net of around 0.8% in our CET1 after the dividend. We will update you at the Q1 results
about the special dividend considerations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. It's probably not possible to close at the end of March and declare in the same quarter just for accounting
reasons. So, it's likely to be close at the end of Q1 and probably declare Q2 and then pay following that. That's
likely to be the accounting requirement just to get the books closed for Q1 and then declaring Q2 is the most likely
outcome.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Noble Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG
So declare in Q2, not with Q2 results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

It's our intent to do it as soon as we can. I can take you through the process, but there is a process we have to go
through and the timelines will need to just flow through. But we'll confirm the timing at the 1Q results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Noble Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG
All right. Thank you. [ph] Those – (01:07:03) just that one little question of what the cash flow [ph] had for
(01:07:06) reclassification in the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Oh, sorry. Yeah. That reclassification is an error in reporting. It's related to one geography where some of our
cash flow hedges were booked wrongly between NII and non-NII and we've done this correction. It is in – it has
affected one jurisdiction. The amount is a full year amount, so I wouldn't – the $0.3 billion charge we've taken
reflects a full year correction of which around a fourth relate to actually the fourth quarter, the rest is a catch up for
the first three quarters of the year.

Just a quick question on the ECL charges and things have subsided [ph] a bit (01:08:18) on the China property
side. Obviously, it's nice for you guys to see, but a few cracks popping up in Mexico. Is that something you
characterize as cycle stuff that might be going somewhere from here we need to keep an eye on or something a
little more one-off?

Thank you, Alastair. So the one-off – sorry, the Mexico ECL related to an increase in our activity is specifically in
unsecured lending. It's a feature of that jurisdiction where margins are very healthy, but the ECL coverage or the
ECL charge tend to be a bit higher. It will depend on our activity but we expect to run at a slightly higher activity in

unsecured lending among other in Mexico than we were before. So I wouldn't look at it as a one-off, but obviously,
it'll depend on the cycle.

Our next question comes from Perlie Mong at KBW.

Perlie Mong Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
[indiscernible] (01:09:30) questions. Just a couple, and I guess the first one is cost. Just what can you do with
cost in the falling rate environment? Because you've talked about management actions. And I guess, the reason
I'm asking is because this year, I believe all in it's about 7% year-on-year, and of course it includes a lot of one-
offs like levies in this quarter and SVB earlier in the year, but on the basis that it crept up from plus 2% year-on-
year, which is I think the first one you talked about for 2023 guidance to the end result being something like 6%,
7%. Just wondering, what levers do you have in your sort of cost management action pocket to combat costs if
revenue were to disappoint? So that's number one.
And the second question is, I think we all talk a lot about what might happen to revenues in a various rate
environment. But – and also just thank you for the disclosures on a structural hedge, but I guess stepping back a
little bit from that, just a couple of clarifications, so in a falling rate environment, how would you expect things like
customer behavior to respond? So things like deposit mix shift like in Hong Kong. So I guess the mix shift towards
turn happened quite a lot faster in Hong Kong versus the UK on the way up and is sort of still ongoing from the
disclosures today.
So, you if rates were to turn, would you expect that flip back to be pretty quick or we're still in a pretty high rate
environment, or do you still expect to mix shift to continue so – or I think you talk about things like capital market
might outperform in a falling rate environment. So I guess on an underlying basis, just how do you see that?
Because, capital markets and loan growth, etcetera, I guess a lot of it's also to do with it underlying GDP as well
and the there's still a lot of uncertainty sort of on the horizon. So even if rates were to come down, just how
quickly do you think these benefits can come through?

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2024
Okay. We'll tackle the cost first and then maybe we come to the revenue second and I'll do a few introductory
comments on how I see revenues. On costs, George, you want to just do a quick analysis of reported costs 2023
versus 2022 target basis, and then reported 2023 to 2024 target basis. And I might just add a few comments to
the end of that on cost levers the way I look at it. But, George?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Very good. Thanks, Noel. So on the reported basis, 2023 to 2022, we were down 1%. So the growth against our
target of 6% also is reflective of the fact that a lot of the restructuring costs we've taken in 2022 did not repeat.
We've guided how the costs have increased from our initial 2% or initial 3% where we included severance into the
6%. Obviously, the [ph] last (01:12:27) percent this quarter was unexpected.
The rules for the FDIC special assessment came in November. The earlier draft rules we've seen in September
indicated we would be incurring that cost in 2024 and 2025, but the rules that came in November had us to, have
to – have the different accounting treatment and accelerate all that, as did all other banks who were subject to the
FDIC special assessment. So just want to call it out that this one was a particular event we called out.
We – as we look at it going forward for 2024, we're looking at the 5% on the target basis growth. This is excluding
the cost reduction we will get from exiting the French retail business and the Canada business. Between the two
of them, we will be exiting on an annual basis, an equivalent of $1 billion, just shy of that, which is around 3%.
That would be a reduction in cost of 3%, but that is excluded from the way we're managing our target basis.
Just explaining how we're coming up with this cost and then Noel can talk you through the levers to manage our
cost, so first, there is this flow through inflation from 2023. There is some wage adjustments we need to take into
account for 2024 based on the flow through inflation from 2023. That component we feel is easing and hopefully
in the outlook of inflation will ease as we go out of 2024 into the future. There is continued spend in technology
and continued investment in some of the growth areas, organic growth areas, that's particularly true in wealth.
And those spending are partly offset by the number of cost management actions, some of which we have taken
already, such as the severance program, which will have a flow through benefit into 2024, and other actions we're
planning to take.
Just before Noel talks to levers, we're looking at cost as in growth from the target basis in dollar numbers. We're
not looking at our cost in the cost efficiency ratio basis. There may be fluctuation to our revenue, but frankly in the
year like 2023, our CER has dropped from 65% in 2022 to 48%. So, we will tolerate some volatility on the CER as
long as we're managing our cost in the spend dollar basis. But [indiscernible] (01:14:57).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you. Thanks, George. I know this is an important topic and let me reiterate upfront, we remain committed to
cost discipline. The question is, how are we achieving cost discipline, and we obviously look for efficiencies in the
existing organization. We invest in tech to drive efficiencies in our processing costs and we're continuing to do
that.
We invest in simplification of the portfolio, closing down businesses organically, exiting costs organically, but
we're also exiting costs through M&A and in our target basis, we adjust for that. But I don't want you to lose sight.
We have exited – we'll be exiting $1 billion of cost in 2024 as a function of M&A decisions, portfolio choices made
for good strategic reasons. $300 million of that was the exit of our French retail business. It's a business that was
22

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2024
losing money. So, we've exited $300 million at cost by selling, and it's going to be profit accretive because that
business was a loss making business.
We've exited $800 million of costs in Canada through selling. We hope to by the end of Q1, not tempting fate.
Why are we doing it? Because that business in our hands was probably valued at around 1 times book and we
were able to generate 2.5 times book as over 2.5 times book. We sold it because it was worth more to somebody
else than to us, and we're redistributing the proceeds of that to our shareholders because we thought it was the
right answer for our shareholders. So, we do internally generated cost efficiency and externally generating cost
efficiency for good strategic reasons, and we'll continue to pull those levers.
Now the other thing is, we are – we do believe an organization like ours with the growth opportunities we have,
we should invest. And we made a decision last year on our original cost target of 3% to actually move it up to 4%
because we were continuing to invest in tech, and in tech today as part of our overall cost base is now around
22%.
When I took over four years ago, tech as a percent of our cost base was 16%. So, we're trying to remain
disciplined on cost and change the nature of the cost to be a much more strategic cost component in driving
future enhancements for customer propositions and efficiencies. So, that's sort of the thinking we have, you have
our absolute commitment, both myself and George and the management teams. We will keep cost discipline.
We'll invest and save at the same time, we have to acknowledge the flow through of inflation. But the other
component, we made a decision on in 2023, given the very, very strong performance the business had, we
thought it was right to go from 4% to 5% by topping up the variable pay by an extra percent.
We thought that was the right decision for our people. So we think it's the right cost decision but it has inflated our
cost compared to our original target of 3%. But I think we had to do the right thing by our people on that. And then
the final 1% taken us to the 6% number you talked about was unexpected. When we talked to you in Q3, we didn't
expect that final 1% to come through for FDIC and bank levies. The FDIC is probably a timing issue. It was going
to come through in 2024 or 2025, but it actually surprisingly came through in the final quarter of the year. So
you've got our commitment, [indiscernible] (01:18:49).
Now as I turn to revenues and let me maybe again decompose how we think about revenue growth outside of NII
or interest income. Clearly, the great work that George and the team have done on hedging and further structural
hedges we put in place and the exit duration is a mitigant to the downside. I look at the opportunity on the upside
in two components. One is our core USP of international banking.
We have within our franchise, clients who operate in more countries than we currently bank them, be they
personal clients or corporate clients. We still have huge amounts of untapped opportunity to further penetrate our
client base. And every time you saw in the revenue multipliers, we take a client to multiple jurisdictions, a revenue
multiplier of five times domestic revenue in wholesale banking, three times domestic revenue in retail banking.
That's an internal generated revenue opportunity, not dependent on GDP, that's in our hands.
The second revenue opportunity you talked about in your analysis is countercyclical, and I do believe – I've been
around 37 years, so I've seen some cycles, and I do believe lower inflation leads to lower interest rates, lower
interest rates lead to a pickup in economic activity normally for the lag effect. And I do believe that pickup will
have a positive impact on capital market activity in our Global Banking and Markets business. I think it will have a
big and positive impact on demand for corporate lending and personal lending in our wholesale and retail
business, lag effect, as I've talked about.

And thirdly, I think consumers will start to shift out of cash into invested assets, and that's a huge opportunity for
our Wealth business and you've seen our track record on our ability to attract net new invested assets over the
last three years. $84 billion, $80 billion, $64 billion, that's where we're very focused and a lot of our investment is
going.
Now, it's for us, the management team to deliver on that. So we know we've got to deliver on tight costs and cost
discipline and we've got to deliver on revenue diversification. My final comment on this is I'm grateful that we've
had four years of transformation because we now are through the majority of that transformation focus, majority,
and we're now focused on that growth opportunity and we're in a fortunate position that all of the hard work of the
last four years has given us that platform for growth. Thank you.

Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
[indiscernible] (01:22:04) I have two broad questions. The first one is kind of split into two and then I've got a
second question around GB&M. Sorry, sorry, capital returns. First broad question, it's around fee income. So the
first part of it is I'm a bit confused by your banking NII sensitivity. You can see in slide 34, $3.4 billion on 100 basis
points rate cut, but the majority of that comes from non-banking – sorry, non-NII. So can you help me there
because I just don't understand that. I thought banking NII kind of stripped out the trading funding costs, so
whatever color you can give us there.

And the related question is that your outlook for fee income more broadly, I get your messaging around wealth
transaction banking is kind of demonstrating positive momentum. But can I ask you about the other big chunk of
fee income, which is GB&M? And there's various moving parts there. I suspect that you think cyclically it's not
earning its full amount, but I also do note the global FX is kind of been decent for a while. So, can you give us
your view on to what extent that business is operating at, below or ahead of kind of capacity? So that was a kind
of broad two-pronged question on fee income, believe or not.
The second question was around your distribution, your approach to distribution, you're potentially facing down
the barrel of slower volume growth in 2024. And I'm interested in, you're arguably then going to be more capital
generative this year on still decent profits and not a lot of balance sheet growth. How do you approach that? Do
you kind of give us additional buybacks through the course of this year or do you kind of hold that powder dry for
bigger rebound in 2025, say? Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. I think, George, do you want to pick up those three points?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure. Aman, so what historically we've been giving you is NII sensitivity. But as you know, there is a big
component that is rate sensitive in our earnings, which doesn't sit in NII, it sits in non-NII under funding cost of the
trading book. And what we've been doing and hopefully that slide was meant to clarify it but I'm assuming now we
have to take probably more offline with you to go through it. What we've been doing is showing the sensitivity of
both the NII to rates as well as the sensitivity of the funding cost of trading book to rates. And then giving you the
full sensitivity of banking NII to rates, because that would be a better representation of how sensitive our earnings
are to rates and that will take away the noise that is created by ongoing commercial decisions on how much we –
how much funds we provide, the trading activity or take away from the trading activity in the year, it kind of
cleanses that information out because, it's just giving you the total that is relevant for our overall earnings. That
sensitivity has reduced by more than half over the year, in part at least for the 30%, 40% of it due to our structural
hedging activity.
With regards the fee income, you mentioned FX having a good and decent income, a couple of things about
GB&M to call out. First, the PBT of GB&M was more than 20% or 25% higher year on year, so clearly a business
that increases PBT. Its return on tangible equity has exceeded our cost of capital, something that has been not
achieved for many years, it's above 12%. And to be also fair to GB&M, its return on tangible equity only increased
by about 10% because there are some corporate center-related adjustments which has affected them, otherwise
their return on tangible equity could have followed the trend of PBT growth because their RWAs were down and
they could have seen close to 20% and therefore well above their cost of equity. So, we're comfortable with how
the businesses' trends continue to transform itself, focusing on their strength and adjusting their footprint, and that
momentum continues.
In terms of distribution, well, first, it remains our ambition to have a rolling series of shared buybacks as long as
our capital supports it and the outlook for capital does support it but this remains subject to ongoing
macroeconomic developments and regulatory approvals, etcetera. And one thing to call out with regard to our
bolt-on acquisitions is when we look at an acquisition, obviously the first parameter is making sure it's a strategic
and accelerating growth area that we strategically want to grow. But the second parameter that we also use
equally is that it is accretive compared to a share buyback. So, we're making sure that when we go for the bolt-on
25

HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2024
acquisition, the investments is more accretive than the investment in buying our own shares. And this is – this
would be a disciplined measure to make sure we're doing M&A that is both strategic and accretive.
And finally, in terms of other parts of the distribution, 50% dividend payout ratio for 2024, which we reaffirmed and
then if you want to give – if you want to have a benchmark on where we would operate on a target basis, our
CET1 ratio, it will be in the 14% to 14.5% range, which we reiterate, but we recognize we may not meet that target
because we may be well above it for a few quarters in particular thanks to Canada, but also to our own capital
generation.

Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
[ph] And (01:28:37) the pace at which we can get back down to that target is going to be dictated by two things,
the capacity of the market to take buybacks, and second, other alternative uses of that capital to support growth.
But I think it's fair to say, there's going to be excess of our CET1 over our target range more in the near term
because probably the capacity of the market to take the volume of buybacks that could be done.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Thank you so much. Can I just to clarify, so is it reasonable then to expect – is it reasonable to target year on year
growth in GB&M? [ph] You know (01:29:18) the fee income business is in GB&M? Is it...

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q

...given the various moving parts, should we think about growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yes. In the strategic area, certainly, I mean, the areas we called out, as, the foreign exchange such as payments,
such as supporting trade, we do expect also growth in, as Noel mentioned earlier, in capital market activity if and
when rates come down, we see progress in this area of the fee income space. Clearly, GB&M has focused itself
and the kind of the message is that in the areas where they're focusing strategically, yes, in the areas where they
have exited or are downsizing, then these would be the non-strategic areas that they will continue doing
downsizing.

Listen, I just wanted to say thank you all for joining. I also want to just say, look, clearly, I'm really pleased that
we've had a record profit year in 2023 and the best returns that we've had for a decade. Really pleased we were
able to reward our loyal shareholders with $19 billion of capital returns to our shareholders in respect to 2023.
This included the best full year dividend since 2008 and three share buybacks. We still expect to have substantial
distribution capacity going forward, and we are committed to cost discipline, I want you in no doubt on that. We
expect to have further opportunities to grow revenue and we're very focused on it because we've come out of that
full-year of transformation phase with a very strong focus on growth. We continue to target a mid-teens RoTE in
2024 and I just want to say thank you for joining us and Neil and the team are available should you need them.
Hope to see many of you here in Hong Kong in April when we hold our inaugural Global Investment Summit.
Looking forward to being back here at the end of March and for the investment summit in early April. Thank you
all very much. Thank you for coming.
