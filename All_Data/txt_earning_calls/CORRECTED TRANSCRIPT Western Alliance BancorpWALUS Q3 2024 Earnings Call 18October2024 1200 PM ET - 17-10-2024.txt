President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Good morning. As always, I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter earnings before turning the call
over to Dale, who will review our financial results in more detail. After I discuss our outlook for the remainder of
2024, Tim Bruckner will join us for Q&A.
Western Alliance delivered solid third quarter results and earned $1.80 per share. These results demonstrated the
bank's ability to sustain and diversify loan and deposit momentum, as well as grow earnings during a changing
rate environment. We produced healthy deposit growth of $1.8 billion or 11% annualized, and HFI loan growth of
$916 million or 7% annualized, despite sluggish demand for overall credit in the economy. Our national diversified
credit origination and deposit platforms uniquely positioned us to sustain strong deposit growth and then deploy
this liquidity into attractive commercial loans, where we can provide deep segment and product expertise.
During a transitional period, for the rate cycle that began in Q3, net interest income grew 25% annualized due to
higher average earning assets. Net interest margin compressed 2 basis points because of lower yields on
variable rate loans. Continued interest rate cuts will enable Western Alliance to realize significant funding cost
savings in both interest bearing and ECR-related deposits going forward. We anticipate a more meaningful benefit
from lower rates in Q4 from a full quarter impact of lower rates.
Q3 results were modestly impacted by $4 billion of mortgage warehouse deposit growth driven by elevated
mortgage refinance volumes, validating our operational excellence as we continue to win market share following
several competitors retreating from the market. After the money center banks, Western Alliance is now the largest

bank operating in this space. This excess deposit growth somewhat impacted Q3 earnings from elevated deposit
costs, but these deposits have helped cement core customer relationships, which will continue to drive strong
risk-adjusted loan volume and spread income. Typical seasonal declines in mortgage warehouse deposit
balances are poised to push Q4 ECR-related deposit costs materially lower.
Non-interest income increased $11 million or 10% quarter-over-quarter, but this growth was tempered by a
decline in mortgage banking income. Our franchise remains poised to specifically benefit from a resumption of
stronger mortgage volume. Pre-provision net revenue grew marginally from Q2, while tangible book value per
share climbed 19% year-over-year. Lastly, asset quality remained stable as non-performing assets to total assets
declined 6 basis points to 45 basis points. Net charge-offs of 20 basis points landed within our Street guidance
range.
Dale will now take you through the results in more detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Ken. During the quarter, Western Alliance generated pre-provision net revenue of $286 million, net
income of $200 million, and earnings per share of $1.80. Net interest income increased $40 million from Q2 to
$697 million, equating nearly 25% annualized growth because of higher average earning asset balances driven
by loan growth. Non-interest income of $126 million rose $11 million quarter-over-quarter from higher service
charges and loan fees, benefiting from commercial banking fees and a new bank owned life insurance policy,
which, along with securities gains, helped mitigate lower mortgage banking income. Securities gains were taken
as we sold the collateral held for a large bankruptcy deposit as it went into distribution.
Mortgage loan production rose 21% from Q2 and 10% year-over-year. Loan servicing revenue was negatively
impacted by prepayment speeds accelerating due to the declining rate environment, which caused a negative
change in the MSR fair value, net of hedging, of $15 million. Non-interest expense for the quarter was $537
million. Deposit costs of $208 million drove the quarter-over-quarter increase due to strong demand in mortgage
warehouse. In aggregate, net interest income growth exceeded deposit growth by $6 million this quarter.
It is important to emphasize the recent 50-basis-point reduction in the Fed Funds target rate occurred less than
two weeks before the end of Q3. Consequently, rate reduction actions for ECR-related deposits were also back-
loaded.
Seasonal outflows in mortgage warehouse from Q4 tax and insurance payments and a full quarter impact of lower
rates make us confident Q3 will prove to be the high watermark in ECR-related deposit costs for this rate cycle.
Provision expense of $34 million resulted from sustained loan growth and $27 million of net charge-offs.
The balance sheet remained at approximately $80 billion, as solid loan and deposit growth were offset by
securities and cash declining $2.4 billion quarter-over-quarter and a further $2.6 billion reduction in period-end
borrowings. A large distribution of bankruptcy settlement funds drove a notable decline in Juris Banking deposits,
which allowed us to sell the collateralizing securities. Loans held for investment grew $916 million to over $53
billion, while deposits grew $1.8 billion to $68 billion at quarter end.
Tangible book value per share continues its expansion, rising 6.5% quarter-over-quarter to $51.98, and was aided
by a large improvement in our AOCI position. Loan growth of $916 million resulted from large contributions from
regional banking as well as mortgage warehouse and MSR lending. We continue to diversify the loan portfolio as
shown by C&I loans growing over $4 billion year-over-year and now accounting for 42% of the held for investment

loan portfolio compared to 37% one year ago. At the same time, we lowered the overall allocation for commercial
real estate investor and CLD categories from 29% to 27%.
Deposit growth of $1.8 billion was generated from seasonal inflows in mortgage warehouse, which grew $4.1
billion, while our consumer digital channel increased $1.3 billion and continued to add more granular deposits
uncorrelated with our commercial banking business lines. Homeowners association deposits also posted growth
in a seasonally softer quarter. As mentioned before, Juris Banking deposits decreased $2.7 billion. Overall core
deposit growth was $2 billion as we modestly reduced wholesale broker deposits by approximately $200 million.
Turning to our net interest drivers. The yield on total securities increased 2 basis points to 4.89%. Our liquidity
position remains solid as unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets were 64% of securities and cash, while
securities and cash were 24% of total assets. HFI loan yields decreased 14 basis points to 6.65% due to asset
repricing for SOFR type loans in advance of the Fed's rate decision. The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 3
basis points higher as a result of $1.3 billion of quarterly deposit growth in our consumer digital channel.
The total cost of funds declined 12 basis points to 2.67% due to the deposit mix shifting toward non-interest
bearing and a smaller proportion of earning assets funded by borrowings. If you compare the difference between
the period-end spot rates and average rates for the quarter, you'll see that the difference is wider for interest-
bearing deposits compared to HFI loans. In other words, we are seeing funding cost tailwinds emerge outside of
just ECR related funding.
In aggregate, net interest income increased $40 million from higher average earning asset balances and loan
growth. Net interest margin compressed 2 basis points from Q2 to 3.61%, which would have been flat, but for the
new BOLI policy, as $800 million of earning assets were deployed for this purpose.
Regarding interest rate sensitivity, Western Alliance is liability sensitive on an earnings at risk basis. With a
dynamic balance sheet at minus 100 basis point rate ramp, analysis indicates pre-tax interest sensitive earnings
should increase 1.5%. In this scenario, the expected negative impact on net interest income would be more than
offset by expected reductions in ECR related deposit costs, as well as a pickup in mortgage banking income that
a lower rate environment should unleash.
Our adjusted efficiency ratio for the quarter was 53%. Modestly higher operating expense growth compared to
revenue growth drove the 120 basis point increase from last quarter. Excluding the impact of the FDIC special
assessment rebate in Q2, this ratio would have remained flat quarter-over-quarter.
Asset quality continues to remain relatively stable. In Q2, criticized assets rose $60 million as special mention
loans declined $30 million, while classified assets increased $90 million. Criticized assets are up only $33 million
from a year ago. We expect the total criticized asset pool to remain relatively stable. Non-performing assets, as a
percentage of total assets, declined 6 basis points to 45 basis points due to payoffs and sales. Our non-
performing assets consist primarily of CRE office loans, which is unsurprising, given the environment
characterized by still elevated interest rates and lower office property valuations.
Quarterly net loan charge-offs were $26.6 million or 20 basis points of average loans. Provision expense of $34
million added reserves in concert with loan growth in addition to replenishing net charge-offs. Our ACL for funded
loans rose $5 million from the prior quarter to $357 million. The total loan ACL to funded loan ratio of 74 basis
points was unchanged and covers 113% of non-performing loans.

Slide 14 shows the updated ACL lock we have regularly provided to add more context behind our allowance
methodology relative to peers. Our ACL lifts from 74 basis points to 1.31% when incorporating the effect of credit
linked notes, which have provided a pool of prepaid insurance money to us to cover charge-offs as well as low to
no loss loans like equity fund resources or low LTV and high FICO residential portfolio and mortgage warehouse
loans. Compared to the $50 billion to $250 billion asset peer banks, we benefit from a greater CLN support as
well as a greater percentage of loans in low to no loss categories.
Our CET1 ratio increased approximately 20 basis points to 11.2%. Our tangible common equity to total assets
ratio moved up approximately 50 basis points from Q2 to 7.2% as our all other comprehensive income loss
position recovered substantially due to a lower rate environment. Given the conversation about Basel III endgame
capital, I also mentioned that our CET1 ratio, excluding AOCI and our loss reserve, is 11.1%, which is 50 basis
points above the second quarter adjusted CET1 ratio of 10.6% and ranks in the top quartile of our asset class
peers.
Finally, tangible book value per share increased $3.19 quarter-over-quarter to 51.98% from earnings growth and
our negative AOCI position improving by almost one third. Our consistent upward trajectory in tangible book value
per share has outpaced peers by tenfold since the end of 2013. Even when incorporating Q3 data for peers,
which is not yet available, WAL's relative performance will still be well in excess of their TPV growth.
I'll now turn the call back to Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Dale. Following our Q3 results, we updated our 2024 and Q4 guidance as follows. We expect loan
growth of approximately $1.25 billion next quarter to be achieved in a safe, sound and thoughtful manner. Our
current 78% HFI loan to deposit ratio provides ample flexibility to selectively originate attractive loans. Deposits
are expected to temporarily decline $2 billion in Q4 due to typical seasonal outflows of property tax and insurance
payments in mortgage warehouse and active management of our deposit mix to maximize deposit betas and
lower the cost of interest bearing and ECR related deposit costs.
Turning to capital, we reiterate that our CET1 ratio will remain at 11% as loan growth continues. Net interest
income is expected to decline approximately 3% next quarter due to market tied variable loans repricing slightly
ahead of funding costs. This dynamic is a function of the transitional period to a lower rate environment that got
underway in Q3. However, ECR related deposit costs are expected to significantly decline by approximately 25%
quarter-over-quarter in Q4 and outpace a decline in net interest income. We expect net interest margin
incorporating operating ECR costs to have bottomed in Q3 and to experience continued expansion into future
periods.
Non-interest income should increase around 8% to 12% next quarter from traction in cultivating commercial
banking fee opportunities and firming mortgage banking income. Non-interest expense should decline between
5% and 9%, mostly from the expected drop in ECR related deposit costs, given the pivot in the rate environment
and the typical Q4 seasonal factors previously discussed.
Asset quality remains in line with our expectations. We expect steady net charge-offs in Q4 in the 20 basis point
area, which implies full year 2024 net charge-offs should be no greater than 20 basis points. We believe this will
still rank among the best of our peers. Lastly, the effective tax rate for full year 2024 is now estimated to fall
between 20% and 22%.

At this time, Dale, Tim and I look forward to answering your questions.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala
with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Good morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
So, I guess, first – just first question around deposits. Trying to understand – I'm assuming you were aware of the
seasonality last quarter when you raised the deposit guidance for the year. So I'm just trying to understand, if you
can give us a little color on the settlement that impact and how pronounced is the seasonality versus just some of
these chunkier outflows? And are there more such deposits that could leave the bank that could have some
meaningful impact on near-term NII trajectory? Just if you can address NII, both in terms of larger outflows and
then how impactful is the 4Q seasonality. Because I'm not sure it was that prevalent in fourth quarter of last year.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Thanks, Ebrahim. I think you've confused a few things, so let me straighten that out. Number one, in Q3,
we did see a very large settlement out of our Juris Banking Group. That was a little bit earlier than our
expectations. We had expected it to happen into 2025. The settlement moved up earlier. Always hard to forecast
when those things are going to happen, dependent on the court system and it depends on lawyers agreeing to
what the settlement terms are. So that came out. And so absent that, we would have grown deposits in Q3 by $5
billion. So we actually grew deposits $2 billion. We paid down $200 million of brokered deposits. And that got us
to the net growth of $1.8 billion.
In Q4, that's when you'll see the seasonal decline of warehouse lending group, which we always have in terms of
deposits flowing out for escrow, insurance and P&I payments that happen at the end of the year. And that's why
we've said that outflow will push Q4's deposit levels down $2 billion.
However, our balance sheet deposit growth or I'll say our balance sheet growth all in, as you move forward into
2025, certainly for deposits, remains unchanged, which is we expect to have $2 billion per quarter on average, $2
billion per quarter of deposit growth. We have a good line of sight into that. We've got clarity into that because of
the number of home-grown deposit platforms that we have built over the years, starting with our granddaddy,
which is the HOA business. Also, our warehouse lending group has a very strong deposit business and we added
business escrow services in the last two years, settlement services, sometimes known as Juris Banking, and our
7

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
consumer digital platform as well, and also corporate trust. So, these are all home-grown deposit businesses that
a couple of years ago really never existed inside of our bank and now are beginning to perform admirably.
In addition, we've got good deposit growth that comes from our commercial lines of business or previously known
as the regional business. So, that's sort of the deposits. And while just on balance sheet, I'll just say – and we
also expect, as we move forward into 2025, to see deposit – loan growth average $1 billion or so per quarter. And
we're running a very – a much lower loan-to-deposit ratio. So, if we have the opportunity to put on, as we say,
good, safe and thoughtful loan growth, we have the liquidity to do that and we could increase our loan growth
throughout the year.
Dale, some of these businesses report to you. Do you want to add any comments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. No, I think that's pretty fulsome, Ken. But maybe an addition, yeah, so we see that we have kind of the
liquidity that we need to be able to proceed. And as such, pushing up our loan-to-deposit ratio into the 80s from
below 80s presently on an HFI basis, we should be able to do that. And there isn't anything like this, Ebrahim, on
the balance sheet [ph] fill (00:20:50). I mean, this was our largest depositor in the whole bank and so, there isn't
maybe follow-through coming in Q4, Q1 or whatever.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Ebrahim, I think we might have left that one of the last pieces of your question. You asked, did I hear
correctly, sort of directionally, what's going to happen with net interest income? Was that one of your questions as
well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
It was going to be my follow-up? So, yes, please, I think you've given the guidance. Just talk to us how that goes,
NII plus ECR deposit cost, with or without rate cuts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, I kind of feel like I asked your question for you. I might as well answer it. All right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
All right. Please share. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, as we look forward, first, our rate outlook is for two more cuts this year, November and December, and then
we have four scheduled for next year at the end of each quarter is the way we forecasted it. All right? So, what
you'll see overall when you look at our balance sheet, inclusive of deposit costs, we are liability-sensitive. So, our
adjusted net interest margin, that's net interest margin less deposit costs, will rise in Q4 and will continue to rise
8


Western Alliance Bancorp.
(WAL) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
throughout 2025. And net interest income less deposit costs, okay, those dollars will continue to rise steadily in
Q4 and then as you roll forward into 2025.
For the obvious reasons, deposit costs are declining. Okay? So, that helps, plus the balance sheet growth is
going to still remain robust and you'll get some volume pickup in that as well for the net interest income less
deposit costs growing throughout 2025 from 2024. And actually, Q4 2024 should be higher than Q3 2024 as well,
if I wasn't clear enough on that. Okay?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Okay. All very clear. I'll let Jon Arfstrom ask you whether or not you can earn $9 plus next year. Thanks for taking
my questions.

Operator: Our next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. Chris, please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Dale, wondering if you could help, or Ken, on the outlook for non-interest income for the
fourth quarter. I know this quarter had an MSR adjustment, but maybe unpack the 8% to 12% growth in fees for
Q4 because some of the line items moved around a little bit. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, I mean, the MSR piece, I mean, a lot of that was really related to the turn in rates. So, we saw a 50%
increase in constant prepayment rates on our mortgage book, just at the initiation of, kind of, lower mortgage
rates, which is, to a significant degree, kind of backtracked presently. We don't see that happening again, but
maybe there was a little more pent-up behavior than we thought. And so, the result of that is the value of that
asset fell more than what the gain would have on what we put against it to hold the valuation constant.
And then, going forward, so we talked about a couple of things. So, one of them is we did a BOLI transaction.
That's going to continue and those new revenues will be consistent there. You can see what we have in terms of
kind of service charges. It was up from the second quarter. We think that, that number is also consistent. We had
some securities gains. We do have some other collateralized deposits, not nearly of the magnitude that we talked
about with the one that went into distribution in the third quarter.
So, I think, we're probably going to have some more security gains, too, as we sell off the collateral related to
those. All of that really actually improves our liquidity because when you have a collateralized deposit, you really
can't do anything else with it. As these things – as we're able to move that and substitute different deposit
situations for that, it gives us an opportunity to really push into higher return assets than what it's in presently.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then just, I guess, my follow-up, the security gains you mentioned, is that in the guide and, I guess,
with a similar magnitude?

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Good morning, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. Maybe looking at the loan growth that you had you referenced, especially on the C&I side, where are you
seeing opportunities for that? And maybe if you could just give us a little bit of early look at 2025 in terms of sort of
the pipelines and the expectation for the sustainability of that growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, as I said, this quarter, we grew $900 million, that's about 7% annualized to total loans of about $53.3
billion. It really came from three or four segments of our portfolio. The regional group grew all in about $300
million. Warehouse lending grew almost $400 million. Some leveraged finance and some resort financing, when
you combine those together, grew another $300 million. So it was almost $300 million, $300 million, $300 million,
almost, or $300 million, $400 million and $300 million. That got us to nearly $1 billion of loan growth for this
quarter.
So, as we look going forward, we see a couple of areas that give us confidence to continue to restate and
reiterate the guide of $1 billion in quarterly loan growth. First, our note financing MSR lending, warehouse lending
group businesses are showing good pipelines and we like this type of financing because they're generally shorter
duration loans, good risk reward. And they also allow us to evaluate credit decisions and collateral on a
continuous basis, which goes to our allowance for loan loss reserves and it goes to our lower credit losses that we
have that this is good collateral, but also we've never taken a loss in any of those categories since we've been in
these businesses.
Then I would say lot banking, resort financing and our regional commercial lending provides the additional value
or added value of growing our loans, but also provides loan growth that comes along with more treasury
management fee income and also allows us to gather lower cost operating accounts. And so that's another area
that we like.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Overall, if you look at our performance year-to-date, we really have focused more on the C&I side. And you see
our total growth for the year has been all on C&I and we've downplayed construction lending and development
and we've also kept our CRE owner occupied flat as well and that hasn't grown, and we've also taken down all
residential loans which carry a lower yield to it. So we'll have some opportunity to put some – when we put new
loans on the books, to have them come in at a higher yield. So I hope that kind of gives you a sense of how we're
thinking about 2025 and what we're doing to prepare for it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. That's good. Thanks. And then, just as my follow-up, looking at capital with the 11% sort of, I won't call it
target, but calling out 11%, we're above that. Should we expect you to continue to grow CET1 from this 11%, too,
or would there be other capital management alternatives that you'd utilize here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Yeah. I understand the question. So, for our forecasting for 2025, we are assuming CET1 stays at or above
11% and stays there modestly at or above 11%. Because we think there is going to be or there could be more
loan growth coming our way than the $1 billion per quarter. And we want to have that CET1 dry powder to support
that. And that's sort of our going in program.
In addition, as we get bigger, okay, I know we're $80 billion and our total assets came down a little bit from Q2 to
Q3. But as we get bigger and we get closer to the category for bank comparisons, which we do today, we look at
other measurements of where adjusted CET1 is that CET1 less the AOCI plus the allowance for loan loss
reserves. And we want to target being in that upper quartile that Dale discussed in his prepared remarks. And so,
we're looking at that as well as a way to guide us as we continue to grow.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Clark with Piper Sandler. Matthew, please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thank you. First question around the ECR related costs. Given the volume and
rate dynamic going forward and assuming either your rate assumptions that you laid out earlier or the forward
curve, what is a good range of expectations for customer service cost dollars in 2025?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, the reason why it's been increasing is really related to – it's become skewed more towards the mortgage
warehouse, which has about 100% beta. And so we expect that to unwind in a similar fashion as it came in.
Hence, Ken's comment that we believe we're going to see a 25% reduction in these ECR costs in the fourth
quarter relative to the third quarter and that should continue as we go into next year.
Again, so we had a scenario whereby our HOA deposits have consistently risen year-in, year-out. We expect that
to continue, while the growth in our mortgage warehouse is going to be tempered. You're going to see an outflow,
primarily related to insurance payments that are made in the fourth quarter. And that's what's going to pull the
total deposit number down. But it's also going to be an area of less focus for us kind of going forward in terms of
growth.

So, in other words, we're going to have an opportunity to be able to lower those costs kind of in lockstep to FOMC
action and in fact, in some cases, above 100%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. And to answer – because you asked the dollar question, Dale gave you a percentage answer. But that 25-
ish percent for Q4 is about a $40 million decline.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Banking Officer-Regional Banking,, Western Alliance Bancorp.
$50 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
$50 million. $50 million. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, my bad. $50 million decline from Q2 to Q3, right? Just remember, Q2
to – I'm sorry, Q3 to Q4, I meant to say it's about $50 million. And remember, you got that 50 basis point bang that
came out of Q3. So, don't model that as a $50 million per quarter, but model it as rates coming down in a very
methodical way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. So, it sounds like it's more rate driven, not volume driven, kind of. Okay. Got it. Okay. And then, just on the
– your kind of a blended question around loan yields. I know SOFR came down ahead of the Fed cuts and I'm
sure that hurt a little bit. It also looked like your loan fees came down to 15 basis points from 24 bps in the prior
quarter and they had been running around that level for a few quarters. I guess, just what happened there and
then how do we think about the overall NIM in the near term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I think I think the loan fee number is really – I mean, you should go with the kind of the current run rate that
we had in that period. In terms of the NIM, I mean, we mentioned in our slide that, on a net interest income basis
alone, we're expecting to see a contraction in the fourth quarter, but that will be more than made up for.
So, as Ken talked about earlier, we're looking for a combined NIM, including the ECRs, which we expect that the
low watermark was actually in the third quarter of 2024 and will increase in each successive quarter through next
year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Bernard Von Gizycki with Deutsche Bank. Bernard, please
go ahead.

Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank
Hey, guys. Good morning. Just on mortgage, you previously obviously guided to 3Q being seasonally weaker with
the loan production volumes were up nicely versus 2Q, while the gain on sale margins declined. And, obviously,
you called out the negative MSR mark. Could you just talk to the puts and takes on how high demand maybe
needs to pick up to see a pickup in gain on sale margins?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
That is something that is a little difficult to handicap, to be very honest with you. Coming into the quarter,
mortgage rates at the end of Q2 were up around 7%, right? And they declined during the quarter to about 6.05%.
And today, they're in the 6.50% area. And so, for us, to handicap that, that's been a little bit of a struggle. It's
based on consumer behavior of cost. And it's also based on consumer timing, i.e., if you know there are a couple
of other rate cuts coming at you, would you go out today and buy a home when you know rates are coming?
And so what we say in the mortgage business is, at least what we have been saying is, people love their
mortgage rate, they hate their home. And now, we're trying to see if people want to find a new home and just rent
their mortgage rate and then refi as they go forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank
Okay. And then just as we think about maybe mortgage more broadly and just the dynamics, like you mentioned,
with mortgage rates coming down closer to 6% and then backing up, what really gets mortgage for you guys? I
think in the past, you've said maybe like three, four rate cuts kind of help and maybe a low 6% is really what's
meaningful to increase production. But just kind of want to get your thoughts, like, maybe the 6.5% hopefully
comes down again. But it is based on some of the pull forward of the rate cut expectation. So just want to get your
thoughts on maybe a mortgage rate level that you think the production volumes kind of pick up and revenues
follow?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I think if you start beginning to see a repeat of the early part of Q3 where rates coming down into the low-
6s, that begins to pick up the volume. You then begin to gather some speed once you break the 6% barrier. The
6% barrier is the equivalent of the – for those that remember, the 4-minute – breaking the 4-minute mile. Okay?
And once you break that 4-minute mile of under 6% and have a 5% handle to begin with, then we really think if
the sweet spot is somewhere in that 5.50% to 5.75%, that's record – that's great opportunities for us. Okay? And
that's sort of how we think.
So, we need to break the 6% barrier. And then, as it drops into that 5.50% area, that's where we think there's a lot
more volume coming our way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I might say a more tempered rate decline we actually think works in our favor. And that is if things fall really
suddenly, I think it's going to maybe have almost a rush of refinance that may not last as much. And part of the
reason why mortgage rates are elevated relative to the 10-year is we believe it's simply because there's the
expectation that if you refi right now, you're going to refi again in six months and it's not going to be worth all the
processing cost to get that done.
And so, if that view were to dissipate a little bit and frankly, I'm pleased that the number of expectations of rate
cuts for 2025 has actually been cut a little bit in the futures market at least, that that really makes it more
sustainable over time. And with that, we think we can maybe see a reduction in the disparity between mortgage
rates and the 10-year treasury, for example, from what it's been historically.

Operator: The next question comes from the line of Timur Braziler with Wells Fargo. Timur, please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. I wanted to just...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
....get some clarity on the expectation for 4Q to be the NII trough. Is the expectation that 1Q maybe you get some
additional margin compression from the asset-sensitive balance sheet and then volume makes it up, or should 4Q
be the trough for NIM compression as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I believe 4Q is going to be the trough as well on the NIM side. Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, just to maybe to put a finer point on Bernie's question. So, for the earnings-at-risk analysis, I
guess, what are you assuming for mortgage rates and kind of mortgage revenues within that earnings-at-risk
analysis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, we would tail into maybe something that ticks into a 5% by the end of next year, a 5% handle, high-5%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. And then, just last thing for me. Just – sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Sorry. I just wanted to add a point to Dale's comments when talking about NIM. He was referencing the adjusted
NIM. Okay? And so, that when you think about it, that's the way I think about it is that adjusted NIM is just net
interest income less the deposit costs. That is all going to flow upward or move upward throughout the year.
Okay? I just want to make that little clarification. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
No, I appreciate that clarification at the end. And just lastly for me, just thinking about HQLA deposits in a rate
down environment, I'm assuming just the short-term nature there is going to be a little bit punitive to NII. Just how
14

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
are you thinking about HQLA levels growing maybe commensurate with the asset base or asset growth, and then
what that might look like from a rate perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, we think we're kind of intact in terms of where we are on what we have in HQLA presently. That
number kind of came down a little bit because we disposed of some of these deposits that were collateralized all
with HQLA categories. So, from here, again, it gives us latitude to grow our loans commensurate with the growth
rate we're going to show in deposits.
And so, as Ken mentioned, so if we're going to grow deposits $2 billion on average and that means that includes
like the fourth quarter decline that's already built into higher growth earlier in those quarters. And then, if you can
grow at 75%, 80%, you're going to have $6 billion of loan growth to match that. And then, the rest of it is going to
fall into other categories like HQLA.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Elian with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Anthony.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everyone. Does your 4Q deposit guide of down $2 billion include any additional paydowns of broker deposits?
Or is the decline really coming from the seasonality of warehouse?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
It's really seasonality of warehouse. We expect our broker deposits to be fairly flat.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then, my follow-up also on deposits. I understand the warehouse is going to seasonally outflow
in 4Q. But, I guess, are there not enough deposit opportunities from other areas of the company to be able to
offset that seasonal headwind for this quarter specifically? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, the other deposit channels do, in fact, negate some of that outflow that you're seeing. But the wealth lending
group is a larger contributor to deposit growth. And the other thing that's happening and I can't – I really should
emphasize this, is that in the warehouse lending group or the industry, we've had several competitors either leave
the industry or retreat from it in a significant way. And we are just seeing more inflow than we would normally
have expected. And that inflow came in in Q3 and will kind of reverse out in Q4. So that's why it's harder to have
the other deposit channels cover that larger inflow for us in Q4. But after these deposits go on a hiatus, as we call
them, they do come back starting in Q1 and will help us with our liquidity as we roll forward throughout 2025.

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
...further thoughts on the combined NII and ECR costs. I just wonder if you're willing to put a finer dime on just the
GAAP NII outlook. Obviously, the fourth quarter is a lower guide. Based on your rate forecast for next year, kind
of the 25 basis points per quarter, how deep into the year would you think it would be and so you could turn
dollars of GAAP NII from a bottom?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
At this point, I think we've given more clarity around 2025 and what we expect than any other conference call that
I've read about so far. And we're going to leave it here. As we announce our Q4 earnings, we'll get into more
detail what that 2025 full year is going to look like. But I think we've given plenty of guidance here on how to kind
of construct what to expect in 2025.

Operator: The next question comes from the line of Samuel Varga with UBS. Please go ahead, Samuel.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Dale, I just wanted to touch on the ECR rates again. I wanted to get your sense for, let's say,
if the Fed funds normalizes around the 3% that a lot of people are pegging, what would be the floor on ECR
rates? I understand that the beta at least initially is expected to be near 100%. But at what point does it just level
off and not move lower?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, I mean, if you look to kind of where we were before when rates were even lower than that during the
pandemic, our ECRs mostly bottomed out around 40 basis points. So there's still a lot of room to continue to push
things down. And frankly, I mean, it's all about what's the alternative for money in these. So, it's like, okay, so they
have these funds. Is some other financial institution going to be paying more than what – like a 3% number in
your example, I think it'll be paying 3.50%, 3.60%. I doubt it because that generally means that funds are available
elsewhere. So we have these diversified funding sources so that we've got all these channels so that we can
meet kind of the credit demand that we have.
So, I don't see that there is a number there that we're going to really – it's going to really get sticky in terms of
pushing things lower as they were much lower before. And there are alternatives for – and not just for, but there
16


Western Alliance Bancorp.
(WAL) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
are alternatives for us if – we can go to other sectors as well and look for funds. So, I mean, they're not going to
move that far away from what the market rate for money is in terms of how low it can go.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Got it. Thank you for that. And then, just my follow-up on the earnings at risk. Can you give us a sense -
obviously, it's hard for us to know exactly what you're assuming on mortgage, but can you give us a sense for, I
guess, what helps more in offsetting the NII compression? Is it the CRAs or the mortgage benefit from
AmeriHome on the fee income side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
What offsets the mortgage income on the fee income side? Well, I mean – so I mean, they have funds that come
from kind of their origination of mortgage servicing, right? So they manufacture these and depending on what that
estimated value is, kind of determines what the gain on sale is. And then, we have the servicing rights that we
value and amortize down. So that's why I look at them more in concert rather than kind of a singular element. I
think it was more important in the third quarter where they were more, I'll say, bifurcated in terms of the response.
And that was really related to this 50% increase we had in constant prepayment rates that took place in August
that was in excess of, I think, what most models would have captured.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh, great. Thanks for the follow-up. Dale or Ken, longer-term question about ROE potential in a down rate
environment. How are you thinking about ROE over the next couple of years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, we don't think that our ROE potential is really that dependent upon the rate environment that is, based
on the balance sheet that we have, the capital that we need, the spreads that we can obtain, that we can continue
to efficiently manage the organization. We know our costs have come up for the past couple of years or so. But
we believe we're going to get back to an efficiency ratio that begins with a 4, instead of a 5 on an adjusted basis,
i.e. with the deposit costs netted against interest income.
And so, that should leave us with a ROTCE in the upper teens. And we believe we're on our way to get there. And
frankly, that's kind of where we're headed. We're not going to get back to the 20s that we were at before because
our leverage is lower with our higher CET1 ratio.

Hey, thanks. Good morning.

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Good morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Ebrahim set me up, I guess. But Ken, I hear you on your 2025 thoughts. Are you more optimistic on 2025 with the
recent rate cuts and the current rate outlook? Is this good for the company generally?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Yeah, I am. My optimism comes first from the balance sheet, right? We've given that guide of $1 billion for
loans and $2 billion on average for deposits, right? And we've been giving that guide for, boy, for seems like a
couple of years now that we continue to do that. And, I think, we have these credit origination platforms that work
well and over the years, we've added the deposit platforms. And so my confidence is in – I feel very strong
strongly about the guide that we can achieve the balance sheet.
The overall liability sensitive nature of the bank, I think in a falling rate environment, as Dale talked about, and
we're talking about this on an adjusted net interest income basis, inclusive of deposit costs. With rate cuts coming
at us, we see that getting better. And so that gives me some confidence as well.
Asset quality, as we see it today, is stable, knock on wood. And so, yeah, I always believe next year is always
going to be both more difficult than the previous year, but I always tend to have a higher level of confidence that
we can get there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. You guys, you use the word transitional a lot and I understand that. It feels like this was kind of an
unusual quarter for you and I hear you on transitional. But do you have like a non-GAAP core EPS number in your
mind for the quarter? I mean, I think you've got MSR, BOLI, I don't know, gains, lower gain on sale, ECR
pressure. There's a lot going on and, I guess, it'd be helpful if you have some kind of a shot at, like a repeatable,
sustainable quarterly EPS run rate in your mind, just because there was a lot – I think a lot going on here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I think that's a fair question. We kind of get to $1.80, which is what was reported. The decline from the
mortgage business was offset by gains from the collateralized deposits that – the securities that help collateralize
deposits and those two things kind of equal out for us. And as we don't think we're going to see that MSR
valuation decline in Q4, and as Dale said, that we have other collateralized deposits and settlements that are
rolling off where we have gains in Q4 that I think it was, Chris who asked the question that we think it's captured in
the run rate.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. Just one for me on core expenses. Stripping out ECR deposit costs, it looks like the core growth run rate
was around 5% in the quarter. And taking your commentary on deposit costs, next quarter seems like another
step higher, 4%. So, that 5% to 4% quarterly run rate of growth, is that something we should expect over the
foreseeable future? Anything temporary within that core expense run rate over the next few quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, the way I'd come out is, is I think about it as the adjusted efficiency ratio as we come out of Q4 through 2025,
which excludes deposit fees. And we think over the course of the year that, that will get at or near 50% by the end
of 2025. So we see the adjusted efficiency ratio declining through 2025.
