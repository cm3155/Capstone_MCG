Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kay, and Happy New Year, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll make some brief comments
about our quarter and 2022, and then turn the call over to Ram for a review of our results in more detail before we
take your questions.
Our fourth quarter results closed out another record year of earnings, driven by strong balance sheet growth, solid
credit metrics [technical difficulty] (01:47) from our differentiated fee income sources. Net income for the fourth
quarter was $100.2 million, or $2.06 per share. For the full year 2022, net income was $431.7 million, or $8.86 per
share, an increase of 22.3%, compared to 2021. Operating pre-tax, pre-provision EPS for the year was $11.73
per share, compared to $9.26 per share for the prior year.
Net interest income for the fourth quarter increased 5% sequentially. This was driven largely by an over $1 billion
increase in average loans, which is a 21% increase on an annualized basis, the impact of rising rates, positive
asset mix shift and loan fees. This was partially negated by an increase in deposit costs, largely driven by deposit
initiatives to attract new-to-bank customers, particularly in our commercial business.
Additionally, we saw some continued market pressures in our rate-sensitive institutional business. As we've noted
in the past, our business profile and funding mix is uniquely skewed in favor of commercial and institutional
customers. These sources experience different place and timing than some of our more retail-heavy peers in the
repricing environment we are in today.
Cycle-to-date, we've had a beta of 54% on interest-bearing deposits and 33% on total deposits. Our deposit
pricing during this cycle is generally aligned with our internal expectations and consistent with what we've been
talking about publicly.
We tend to focus more on total funding costs, which considers the benefit of DDA balances and the impact of
borrowing levels. That beta is 36% cycle-to-date. And we benefit on the assets side as well, with a cycle-to-date
beta of 53% on loan yields. 60% of our loans reprice within the next quarter and 70% in the next 12 months. We
expect this repricing, combined with our outlook for loan growth, will continue to drive good growth in net interest
income.
Pipelines and sales activity in our fee businesses continue to be strong across the company, driving year-over-
year non-interest income growth notwithstanding some market-related variances. I'm excited for the opportunities
we see in 2023 and beyond. Updates on our various lines of business are included in our slides and Ram will
share a few details shortly.
We've long focused on our goal of positive operating leverage rather than specific revenue and expense levels.
For the full year of 2022, we generated leverage of 6.7%. This continues to be a focus for us and we expect to
generate positive operating leverage again in 2023.
Moving to lending, the drivers behind our 21% linked-quarter annualized growth and average balances this
quarter are on slide 23. Total top line loan production, as shown on slide 24, remains strong at $1.3 billion for the
quarter, bringing full year 2022 originations to a record $5 billion. Payoffs and paydowns represent 3.4% of loans
for the fourth quarter. While we and peer banks have seen some slowdown in the sale on refi markets, payoffs
are hard to predict from quarter to quarter. The average for the year was just over 4%, in line with our longer-term
trends.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
C&I lending provided nearly half of our $1 billion of average loan growth for the quarter, with balances increasing
21% on a linked-quarter annualized basis. Commercial demand continues to be strong and we're seeing robust
activity within our existing customer base. Line utilization has picked up from last year and was at 37% for the
fourth quarter.
Commercial real estate and construction loans posted 25% annualized growth in the fourth quarter, predominantly
in multifamily and industrial properties. Construction represented a large portion of new commitments in 2022. So
we'll see the additional impact and balances as those loans begin to fund. Average residential mortgage balances
have increased 21% over the fourth quarter of last year, despite the impact of rising rate environment.
Our down payment assistance program for the first time homebuyers had more than 1,600 new applications,
resulting in $2.9 million in assistance in 2022. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we see opportunity in our various
verticals across the footprint, and we expect continued strong growth to kick off 2023.
Credit quality remains excellent. Net charge-offs were just 4 basis points of average loans for the fourth quarter
and 21 basis points for the full year. Non-performing assets comprise a modest 5 basis points of total assets.
Provision for the quarter of $9 million was driven by our continued strong loan growth, portfolio metrics and
changes in the macroeconomic environment. Our reserve coverage is now at 0.91% of total loans.
Back to the balance sheet, average total deposit for the quarter increased 5.3% or 21% on an annualized basis,
compared to the third quarter. Our deposit initiatives in commercial banking brought in more than $1 billion during
the quarter. DDA balances remained steady from the last quarter and represent 40% of average deposits,
compared to 42% in the third quarter and 41% in the fourth quarter of last year.
The economic data continues to be a paradox, with the labor market signaling a soft landing, but other indicators
like the LEI index are signaling a more prolonged recession. We have ongoing dialogue with our clients about
their business and outlooks. And borrowers are generally seeing good pipeline and many are reporting that
supply chain issues have mitigated somewhat. However, caution remains as finding talent to support growth may
be a headwind. As I mentioned, we see good growth opportunities in the first quarter, and although we continue to
closely monitor early warning indicators, we're not seeing any broad concerns.
Overall, 2022 was a very strong year. While the unpredictability of the current rate environment is challenging, our
time-tested business model and relationships-based culture continues to perform well and we're off and running
as we start the 2023 year, with a goal to maintain positive operating leverage regardless of the health and
direction of the economy.
Now, I'll turn it over to Ram with some additional comments. Ram?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Thanks, Mariner. Let me start with some commentary on balance sheet trends with our liquidity profile shown on
slide 20. Our Fed account, reverse repo and cash balances rebounded slightly to $1.8 billion and now comprised
5.1% of average earning assets with a blended yield of 3.65%, compared to 2.3% in the third quarter. This was
driven by our deposit campaigns as well as seasonal inflow of public funds deposits.
Cash flow from our security portfolio continued to help fund loan growth opportunities during the quarter. As
shown on slide 27, the portfolio roll-off for the fourth quarter was $246 million with a yield of 1.94%, while we
purchased $84 million in securities, primarily CLOs with a yield of 5.04%. Additionally, the portfolio is expected to

generate over $1 billion of cash flows in the next 12 months. The yield on those securities rolling off is
approximately 2.03%. While Treasury yields present very attractive reinvestment levels, our priority is to fund the
opportunities we continue to see in our lending verticals.
Loan yield increased 89 basis points from the third quarter to 5.35%, with the linked-quarter beta of approximately
61%. The total cost of deposits, including DDAs, was 1.23%, up from 65 basis points last quarter.
Net interest margin expanded 7 basis points from the third quarter. The largest positive NIM impacts included
approximately 52 basis points from loan repricing, loan fees and mix, 34 basis points for the benefit of free funds,
and 7 basis points from reduced liquidity balances and rates. Offsets included a negative 94-basis-point impact
related to the cost and mix of interest-bearing liabilities.
As we look ahead, there are a lot of variables at play that will impact the trajectory of our net interest margin,
including the depth and duration of Fed's tightening cycle, outlook for equity markets and that impact on deposits,
expected disintermediation of DDA balances as ECR rates further increase and our own need to generate
additional deposits through targeted campaigns to fund loan growth.
Based on our own simulations, we expect our first quarter net interest margin to be flat to slightly up from fourth
quarter levels. Additionally, we stand to benefit when the Fed pauses as the pressures on our indexed deposit
book update and asset yields benefit from the current repricing environment and rotation from investment
securities.
As Mariner noted, while the focus on deposit betas and NIM is important, we also focus on net interest income
growth facilitated primarily by loan growth. Additionally, we typically manage to a loan to deposit ratio limit of 75%.
In the fourth quarter, average deposit growth kept pace with loan growth, keeping our ratio steady at just under
65%. Given our strong loan growth outlook, we will continue to focus on deposit and client acquisition across all
our lines of businesses.
Back to the income statement, total fee income for the quarter was $125.5 million, compared to $128.7 million for
the third quarter. We saw some market-related declines, including a $2.3 million decrease in company-owned life
insurance income, along with a $900,000 decrease in customer-related derivative income.
COLI income, which was just [ph] $21,000 (12:14) in the fourth quarter versus $2.3 million in the third quarter had
a similar offset in deferred compensation expense. For the full year 2022, the 18.6% increase in fee income
included investment security gains and losses, driven largely by the gain on sale of Visa Class B shares in the
second quarter.
Outside of these gains, we saw positive results from several businesses, including $31 million of additional
brokerage fees related to higher 12b-1 and money market revenue share income, despite market-related
compression of 11% in the underlying money market balances compared to year end 2021.
Trust and securities processing income increased 5.8% year-over-year and included strong contributions from
fund services and corporate trust. For the full year, we had a decrease of $10 million of COLI income with a
similar decrease in deferred compensation expense.
Slide 22 shows trends in non-interest expense. The 2.8% linked-quarter increase was primarily driven by an
increase of $2.6 million in processing fees, largely software costs related to the ongoing modernization of core

systems, $2.1 million in additional marketing and business development expense driven by increased advertising
for various campaigns and projects, and $1.8 million of increased charitable giving included in other expense.
Additionally, as I mentioned last quarter, our amortization expense increase related to the acquisition of HSA
deposits completed in the fourth quarter.
A few items to note for the expense levels going forward. As is typical, fourth quarter expenses included several
timing-related variances along with some non-recurring items. Considering those variances, we've put our
quarterly starting point closer to the $225 million to $247 million (sic) [$227 million] range. Also keep in mind that
first quarter expenses are typically higher due to the seasonal reset of payroll taxes and other benefits expenses.
The acquisition of HSA deposits will add approximately $4.5 million of additional amortization expense annually.
And as previously mentioned, the increase in FDIC assessment rate takes effect in the first quarter. As a
reminder, we estimate this will have an approximate annual impact of $6 million pre-tax.
As Mariner noted, our focus remains on generating positive operating leverage, while prudently investing in our
businesses. Our effective tax rate was 19.1% for the fourth quarter and 18.9% for the full year, reflecting a smaller
portion of income from tax-exempt municipal securities along with changes in COLI valuations. For the full year
2023, we anticipate it will be approximately 19% to 20%.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And I'll now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of
the call.

Q
Good. How are you? I guess, just big picture, [ph] you guys (15:58) going into a potentially recessionary
environment, we've heard a few banks talk about maybe tightening the credit box a little bit. I guess, could you
just talk about if you're thinking about doing anything similar, if you're seeing any signs of hesitation or caution
from borrowers on the ground?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
[ph] John (16:20), thanks for the question. This is Mariner. I would – for us, for those of you who've followed us for
a while, we really don't do anything different in any type of environment. We stick to our knitting and look for the
good quality opportunities and we don't reach during the good times and we don't retract during the tougher times.
We're kind of just stick to what we know and stick to doing how we do it. And so that's the backdrop for how we're
making decisions.
As it relates to what we're hearing and seeing on the ground, customers and prospects are still talking cautiously
optimistically about the environment for the year. Revenue projections and conversations seem to still be pretty
steady. I think the challenge that we hear from our customers really is about the hiring environment. But as it
relates to selling goods and moving goods, everybody seems to be cautiously optimistic about that. And as we
normally do, we give you a little look into what we see for the first quarter and pipeline remained strong for the first
quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. Great. Thanks. That's a good color. And I guess, just one other area. You closed the HSA acquisition in the
fourth quarter. Could you just talk a little about the outlook for your competitive positioning, I guess, in that market
with some pretty large players kind of dominating at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James D. Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Bank
Hi. This is Jim Rine. We did close the – the conversion went extremely well. We picked up – they have a very
successful direct-to-employer model. And that has been our strategy moving forward. Backdrop looks good. As
far as on a national level, the government and [ph] sales entities (18:19) have been very quiet. So we don't
anticipate any changes as far as the need for HSAs or HSA is going away. Our pipeline looks extremely strong.
Regarding our competitors, we're obviously more focused on what we're doing. But we feel like we have an
extremely competitive platform. And this will allow us to deliver a better experience throughout our footprint. With
what the competitors are doing, we're truly more focused on us. But we've been able to compete in this space for
a long time. And we're one of the original pioneers in this space. We feel very good about our position going
forward. And we're in the space to stay and we're excited about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, the only thing I'd add is, the technology platform and the backdrop for the business is really using the rails
we have already for all of our other businesses. So it's a very leverageable business. And being a big commercial
bank, largely that's been – largely what we do is direct-to-business model. There's a lot of opportunity within our
own customer base to continue to grow. And it's all about the enrollment season and just current customers and
new commercial customers adding employees through the enrollment season.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Okay. Great. Thank you. Thanks for answering my questions.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Morning. Ram, maybe a question for you, just on the balance sheet, if I'm thinking about your comments
on loan to deposit, you have room there, and you can be more selective on deposits. But if I look at just the total
deposits at the company, [ph] it's strong (20:18) about 8% this year. How do I – I guess, how should we think
about just the pace of incremental run off? Because it feels like you've got roughly $1 billion of cash flow coming
off the bond book to fund loan grow. I'm just trying to get a sense of the moving pieces here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Chris, this is Mariner. A couple of high level comments, and if there's more detail, you want, Ram can add
some color. But I think, really, what I would focus on, we don't really expect runoff. We expect rotation. And so it's
really more about what happens to demand deposits. We have a very, very strong pipeline and ability to grow
deposits. So we can bring deposits on at market rates and fund growth. No problem.
So really, the challenge for us, which we think we're good at is being disciplined at pricing the assets. So as we
bring on loan growth, as we discussed last quarter, our ability to be disciplined on maintaining and slightly growing
margin is more important than what the absolute cost of deposits are coming on. So we're not concerned about
that. And we feel strongly that we can continue to price appropriately on the asset side to maintain our margin, if
not grow it slightly.
I don't know if you want to add anything to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
The only thing I would add, Chris, to that is, as we said, our loan-to-deposit ratio is now 65%, right? If you look at
the last couple of quarters of loan production and what's happened there is the same pace continues. We did see
our loan deposit ratio trickle up to close to 70%, which we're comfortable with.
As I said in my prepared comments, we managed to stay below 75% on the loan-to-deposit ratio. Will deposits
fund 1:1 of what we see on the loan growth? Probably not. But that's where the billion dollars of securities that you
talked about in terms of outflows comes in. So – and as Mariner said, we're focused – we'll be focused on making
sure we stay liquid on the balance sheet with customer acquisitions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's really great. Thanks, Ram and Mariner. On the mix of your deposits, I'm looking back, pre-COVID, you
were kind of in the mid-30s non-interest-bearing. You got as high as 46%. You're kind of low-40s now. I guess,
how are you thinking about just internal migration, given the competitive alternatives for rates today?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. So I think that's the million-dollar question, Chris. And when you get the answer, give us a call, so we can
plan. But I think the conservative way to think about it, right, is we got down to 32% last time. Could it get to 35%
or something this time? Probably, maybe based on just history, that's possible. However, there are a lot of other
things going on from the growth of our customer base in general. We've added a lot of small business customers
that have a low loan-to-deposit ratio over the last few years. We've got a lot of other initiatives and customer
bases. Our aviation corporate trust business is relatively new. And those demand deposit balances have been
growing.
So last cycle, we got down to 32%. Does history repeat itself? Is the world different? Is our customer base
different? We're not sure exactly what happens. We do believe there will be some rotation from demand this year
still to interest-bearing. We're just not sure how much. The internal debate we have here, because we already
saw a lot of that last year is – has it already happened, right? So that's one of the questions that we debate
internally is, has that shift taken place? Does everybody who wants to move to higher interest-bearing deposits
already taken that action? We don't really know the answer to that. But that's some of the internal debates. But to
be conservative, think about last cycle, I suppose.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, that's helpful. I really appreciate it. The last one I would have is just kind of zooming out, right, if I think
about the bullish comment on loan growth, call it, stable comments on margins. It would feel like the net interest
income for your company has yet to peak, because I think that's a narrative that's going around among bank
investors, where a lot of your peers are seeing margins and revenues top out. I guess, would you agree or offer
any thoughts on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
We expect to see net interest income continue to grow because we're a growth company. Like I said earlier, two
things we focus on would be net interest income growth based on just growth period as well as growth of the
balance sheet. And then, the other thing, we think we can do during this environment is produce operating
leverage. So we're less worried about the absolute expense levels of the company, because we're investing in our
business for growth. And then, on the other side, because we have a long track record of building pipeline, we
think we'll continue to grow.
We've been doing double-digit loan growth since 2015. And there's nothing about our business model that would
suggest that we can't continue to do that. We have new markets, great new markets. We've expanded into Utah,
Minneapolis, Texas are three young markets for us that we have fabulous track records in and great people on
the ground. And we're seeing really good traction there. And along with all of our other great markets, we see the
same great opportunities and traction.
And remember, we don't project or predict our loan growth based on what's happening in the GDP anyway. Our
loan growth is based on market share gains. So depending on – regardless of what's going on economically, we
think we can continue to deliver the same kind of loan growth that we've been delivering.

Yep. Good morning, everyone, and appreciate you guys taking the questions.

Good morning, Nate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
A question on just the longer term or perhaps full year margin trajectory over the course of this year, as you guys
think about what you're paying on incremental deposits outside of the indexed deposits [indiscernible] (27:30) do
you see some additional margin expansion potential in the back half of this year, just given maybe some lagging
repricing within the loan book relative to maybe kind of the incremental cost of deposits that you guys are
gathering based on some of the initiatives that you guys outlined earlier in the prepared comments assuming the
Fed pauses all hikes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, Nate. This is Ram. Yeah, definitely, we see some opportunity for margin expansion if the Fed does pause
and hold, right? So the pressure on our index deposits, as Mariner said earlier, where we are being disciplined on
the loan side and paying market rates on the deposit side, that will still be accretive to our margin. So that's been
our focus. So when you think about what happened last cycle, the same thing repeated itself where our margin
did expand when the Fed paused.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q

Okay. Great.
[indiscernible] (28:25)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
And some of the margin benefit expansion also comes from the rotation that we talk about from – if you look at
the next 12 months cash flows from our securities book that have the 2% exit yield. And obviously, our loan
pricing is much better than that and we pick up yield on that.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
We don't disclose that, Nate. We don't get into that kind of the details.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Fair enough. And changing gears, Ram, I think in your prepared comments, you mentioned a starting point
for expenses in the $245 million to [ph] $247 million (29:09) range for the fourth quarter. Did I get it correctly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
No, $225 million to $227 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. And within that guidance, I mean, as you guys think about some additional modernization initiatives
that you guys are outlining on the core system side of things or otherwise, how does that factor into just overall
expense growth for this year in light of the inflationary environment that we're seeing for wages and so forth these
days?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
So I mean, at a high level, I mean – so the run rate that Ram's taking about is inclusive of whatever spending
we're doing to modernize and invest in the business. It's all in there in that step-off that he's referring to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. The step-off, the $227 million that I talked about, obviously, there's inflation on top of that. New contracts
are coming up. We are making some selective investments and people are in technology. And then, as I said in
the first quarter, we'll have the reset of payroll taxes and other benefits expense and then this obviously less – a
couple of less salary days. So I would expect the trajectory from $227 million for the first quarter to go up just
because of the pressure from primarily seasonal increase in expenses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Sure. And as you guys look at criticized/classified trends across the portfolio, obviously, non-performers are pretty
negligible amount as we ended the year. Are you seeing anything across portfolios? And you're in discussions
with clients that would perhaps cause you guys to come in below your historical charge-off guidance. I think you
guys have spoken to around [ph] 25% to 35% (31:01) historically.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
When you say below, do you mean more losses or do you mean better performance? I might ask that question
which way you're asking the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I would think that perhaps charge-offs this year can come in below or better than the historical [indiscernible]
(31:25) talked about Mariner.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, I guess, I would suggest that we – as has been referenced on the call already, it's a softer environment. And
I wouldn't suggest us to – we're going to do a lot better or anything because – for any reason. I mean, we expect
that we can continue to perform the way we have been performing. I don't see anything that on the horizon that
makes it anything better based on any information that's out there. I think we can just keep doing what we've been
doing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
