Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Today, we reported third quarter 2022 results, including
record earnings of $351 million or $2.60 per share, an increase of 35% over the second quarter. We generated
excellent financial results with all-time high revenue of $985 million, up 19%, improved our efficiency ratio to 51%,
and maintained a strong credit position with our percentage of criticized loans well below our historical average.
We continue to benefit not only from the rising rate environment, but also from investments and strategic
management of our business to support long-term success. We produced another quarter of broad-based loan
growth and continue to generate solid fee income. While our customers are closely monitoring recessionary risk
and its potential impacts, they remain generally confident in their ability to successfully navigate the changing
landscape.
Corporate responsibility remains a priority as we continue to demonstrate our commitment to supporting
economic growth in our local communities. We announced a dedicated business banking team for the southern
sector of Dallas County with a mandate to provide capital solutions for underserved entrepreneurs and small
businesses. We enhanced our national community impact manager role responsible for leading our Public
Purpose and Community Impact Investments.

Our green loans and commitments continue to grow and totaled $2.2 billion at quarter end. Our recently
announced renewables group is already off to a strong start, with over $200 million in new commitments year-to-
date and a growing pipeline.
We are incredibly proud of our community impact and financial results, and we continue to focus our efforts on the
future. Through our modernization initiatives, we're making strategic investments to adapt to the changing
landscape and move into a new era of banking. We announced and expanded office footprint in Frisco, Texas
and Farmington Hills, Michigan, commitments we are excited to make in important markets. These innovation
hubs delivered enhanced colleague work experience and assist us in attracting and retaining top talent.
Also, we realigned our organization to create an even more synergistic structure supporting our commercial
banking expertise while adding transformational leadership in payments. We believe this structure will better
serve the comprehensive and evolving needs of our customers allowing us to deepen relationships and enhance
revenue. Further, in conjunction with our strategic modernization objectives, we refreshed our company's core
values. Driving collaboration, encouraging bold thinking and behaviors, and empowering our employees all while
remaining centrally focused on our customer is critical to achieving continued success.
Let's review the highlights of our third quarter results on slide 4. Following second quarter significant loan growth,
third quarter activity remained strong. Average loans were up $1.1 billion reflecting increases across a number of
businesses, the largest being Commercial Real Estate, National Dealer Services, Environmental Services, and
Wealth Management.
Commercial Real Estate benefited from the continued build out of projects and the pace of pay-offs normalizing
due to the rate environment. We have made selective investments to expand our Wealth Management business
and we are excited to see the growth and momentum this quarter. Other business lines saw merger and
acquisition activity and continued investment in working capital albeit at a slower pace in the second quarter. We
continue to strategically manage deposits as customers draw down on their operating accounts and seek higher
yielding products for excess balances.
We made significant progress on our hedging strategy, which should help insulate earnings through rate cycles.
Yet we maintained most of the benefit from higher rates which combined with the growth in our loan and
securities portfolios drove a record net interest income. Credit quality remained excellent and fee income is strong
with increased derivative activity. Expenses were driven by our performance based compensation and
investments to support growth. Our efficiency ratio further improved to 51% as a result of record revenue and a
solid expense management. Retention of earnings drove our CET 1 ratio back up to an estimated 9.92%. Overall,
an excellent quarter, and we feel very positive about the trajectory of our business as we move through the
remainder of the year.
And now I'll turn the call over to Jim, who will review the quarter in more detail.

Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 5, as Curt mentioned, we continue to have broad
based loan growth with balances increasing $1.1 billion. Favorable environmental factors and demonstrated
expertise across a number of our specialty businesses drove our [ph] outstandings (00:06:59) higher. Also, loan
commitment reduction was very strong, which can be a good indicator of future loan growth. As of quarter end,

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
loan commitments increased almost $2.8 billion or 5%, which outpaced loan draws, resulting in a small decline in
line utilization to about 45%.
Loans in our Commercial Real Estate business increased to over $350 million as we funded construction of
projects. Nearly all of the growth was in Class A multifamily or industrial projects built by large developers that we
know well, providing significant equity contributions. Credit quality in this business is excellent. Criticized loans
remain extremely low, and we see no meaningful signs of negative migration.
National Dealer Services loans continue to slow rebound and grew over $200 million. This includes a $140 million
increase in floor plan loans to $980 million. However, inventory levels remain low, and these balances are well
below our pre-COVID run rate. We haven't benefiting from acquisition activity in this space. We still believe it will
take some time for inventory levels to rebuild as supply issues are resolves and pent-up demand is satisfied.
Growth in Environmental Services and Corporate Banking resulted from a combination of new customers, M&A
as well as investment in working capital and CapEx. Wealth Management had a strong quarter with 3% loan
growth in part due to customers' tax-related activities such as 1031 exchanges. Average loans in both Equity
Fund Services and Mortgage Banker Finance were down, and Equity Fund Services following very strong growth
in the past couple of quarters, we saw it moderate early in the quarter, but momentum resumed in period-end
loans and total commitments were up.
Mortgage Banker average loans decreased $62 million and $657 million at quarter end, significantly muting our
total period-end balances. Volumes in that business remain depressed due to higher interest rates and lack of
housing inventory. Loan yields increased 100 basis points to 4.64%, primarily reflecting the benefit from higher
rates.
In line with expectations, slide 6 shows our average deposits continued to decline. Customers put their excess
liquidity to work and we prudently managed pricing related to non-relationship-based deposits in highly rate
sensitive segments. We continued to see the largest decreases in our interest-bearing deposits, particularly in
financial services, financial institutions and Corporate Banking businesses. Our strategy through this cycle has
been to balance deposit pricing with our liquidity needs, while most importantly, retaining our customer
relationships. We have taken an agile and customized approach to finding that right balance. Our mix remains
favorable at 57% non-interest bearing reflecting the relationship and operational nature of our deposits.
Our overall liquidity position is strong with a loan to deposit ratio at 71%, which is well below our historical
average. We have significant capacity to support loan growth, including efficient borrowing channels available
such as broker deposits or federal home loan bank lines, which we began utilizing at the end of the quarter.
Interest bearing deposit costs remained low at 20 basis points. With a year to-date beta of only 7%, we do not
expect to achieve a cumulative beta of 25% until sometime next year. Of course, the ultimate cumulative beta will
depend on FOMC monetary actions in addition to loan and deposit activity.
Our securities portfolio continues to play an important role in achieving our asset sensitivity objectives. Slide 7
demonstrates the significant growth in balances and yield over the past year. Quarter-over-quarter, average
balances increased $1.5 billion, reflecting the full benefit of our second quarter purchases net of mark-to-market
adjustments. Higher rates resulted in a mark-to-market of almost $1.2 billion at period-end, and this impact runs
through OCI and affects our book value, but not our regulatory capital ratios. While we maintain the portfolios
available for sale, mostly for liquidity purposes, we typically hold these securities to maturity, in which case the
unrealized losses should not impact income.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
As another avenue to provide liquidity for loan growth, we see securities purchases partway through the quarter,
which contributed to period-end balances declining to $19.5 billion. As the portfolio shrinks, we plan to manage
our asset sensitivity through additional swaps as needed. Over the past year, we've concentrated our purchases
in agency CMBS with a goal of delivering more consistent cash flows with an average duration of slightly over five
years. The larger average portfolio, along with the favorable new purchase yields, resulted in a $19 million
increase in securities income.
Turning to slide 8, net interest income increased $146 million to a record $707 million, and the net interest margin
increased 80 basis points. The benefit from higher rates lifted loan income $128 million and added 64 basis points
to the margin. Although the rate environment has increased the cost of borrowing for our customers, we've not
seen a meaningful increase in competitive pressure on spreads. Loan growth added $13 million and 2 basis
points. One additional day in the quarter provided $4 million. As I mentioned, the increase in the size of the
securities portfolio at higher yields added $19 million. As far as deposits at the Fed, higher rates combined with
lower balances added $11 million and 26 basis points to the margin. Higher rates in our floating rate wholesale
debt, in addition to our subordinated debt offering, had a $15 million impact. Altogether, the rise in rates provided
a net benefit of $151 million to net interest income.
Credit quality remained excellent as outlined on slide 9. Net charge offs were only 10 basis points, well below
historical averages. Criticized nonaccrual loans also stayed low. With the heightened economic uncertainty, our
allowance for credit losses increased modestly to 1.21% of loans. Our provision increased to $28 million. As
always, we are closely monitoring the portfolio for signs of stress and are proactive in our credit management. We
have begun to see some signs of normalization in certain portfolios with our consistent, disciplined approach as
well as our relationship model and diverse customer base we believe we're well positioned to manage through a
recessionary environment.
Non-interest income increased $10 million or 4%, as outlined on slide 10. Deferred comp, which is offset in
expenses, increased $11 million and was still a headwind in absolute terms with a $3 million negative return for
the quarter. Overall, fee generation remained strong, led by growth in derivative income of $6 million due to
energy and interest rate related activity, which included a $2 million increase in favorable CVA adjustments.
Brokerage service fees grew as a result of increased money market funds revenue. This growth was partially
offset by reductions in fiduciary income and card fees. Annual tax fees received in the second quarter and market
activity impacted fiduciary income and a decline in volumes affected card fees.
Turning to expenses on slide 11, our efficiency ratio improved 7 percentage points to 51% as we continued to
maintain our expense discipline while revenue generation accelerates and we position for future growth. Salaries
and benefits increased $13 million, primarily due to the $11 million change in deferred compensation, which is
offset in non-interest income. Beyond deferred compensation, we saw an increase in performance based
incentives tied to our strong financial results. Of note, our staff levels were stable as we successfully retain and
attract talent in this competitive market. Occupancy expense increased $4 million, driven by seasonality and the
new lease in our Farmington Hills location. Outside processing for our card programs, largely driven by rate
related pricing, increased $2 million.
We've made progress on certain modernization initiatives and incurred $7 million in costs consistent with the
second quarter expense. As previously discussed, this is a journey which includes transformation of a retail
banking delivery model, alignment of corporate facilities and technology optimization. The cost savings generated
are expected to be reinvested as we continue to evolve.

Slide 12 provides details on capital management. With record earnings, our strong capital generation outpaced
capital needed to support loan and commitment growth. Thus our CET1 ratio increased to an estimated 9.92%.
As always, our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive
return to our shareholders. We closely monitor loan and profitability trends as we balance maintaining our CET1
target of approximately 10% with our dividend and share repurchase strategy.
Our common equity declined in the third quarter as a result of the impact of OCI losses from our securities and
swap portfolios. Excluding the AOCI losses, our common equity per share increased a $1.98 or over 3%. Also
note that our tangible common equity was 4.82%. However, excluding AOCI, it increased to 9.12%.
Slide 13 provides an update on our interest rate sensitivity. Over the past year, we have been working to fulfill our
strategy to lock in higher rates and achieve a strong and more predictable earnings stream through the rate cycle
by reducing volatility to net interest income. Based on our standard model with a 100 basis point decrease in rates
over 12 months, we have achieved our target for a low single digit percent impact to net interest income and yet
maintain some upside should rates continue to rise. We are now focused on smoothing the periods further out to
maintain our target level of sensitivity, mainly through the purchase of forward dated swaps.
Considering expected loan and deposit activity including some acceleration of our deposit pricing along with the
September 30th forward curve, we forecast net interest income to grow by 4% to 5% in the fourth quarter relative
to the third quarter. Full-year 2022 is expected to exceed 2021 by more than 33%. We utilized our model to
provide scenarios, including a 100 basis point gradual increase in rates over a 12-month period, which resulted in
an approximate $35 million increase in net interest income. In addition, we borrowed a catch up of a 25%
cumulative beta since – when rates began to rise in March on top of the 100 basis point up scenario, which
resulted in an estimated $35 million headwind to net interest income. Of course, there are many dynamics, which
may cause modeled results to differ from actual outcomes.
Overall, we believe our predictability of earnings provides us the ability to more consistently invest in our business
and thereby grow customers and revenue and provides a more compelling investment thesis for our
shareholders.
Our outlook for the fourth quarter and full-year 2022 is on slide 14 and assumes a continuation of the current
economic environment. We are working on our 2023 financial plan and expect to provide our customary full-year
guidance during our fourth quarter conference call. But I will offer some color as we go through each line item.
Loan growth has been robust so far this year and we expect 2022 full-year loan growth to exceed 7%, excluding
PPP loans. This includes our expectation for average loan growth of approximately 1% in the fourth quarter.
Positive trends are expected in most of our businesses in the fourth quarter, however, at a more moderate pace
given the slowdown on economic activity. Mortgage Banker is expected to continue to be a headwind. Assuming
economic conditions do not change materially, we expect continued solid growth into next year.
We expect deposit trends to continue as customers draw down on deposits to support their businesses and in
some cases seek higher yielding options. Looking into next year, the timing and the scale of deposit activity is
expected to be highly influenced by Fed tightening actions and the economic environment.
As discussed in the previous slide, we project strong fourth quarter net interest income, up 4% to 5% over our
record third quarter. As we think about 2023, we expect to benefit from higher rates and loan volume. On the
other hand, deposit balances and pricing could put pressure on 2023 net interest income relative to the fourth
quarter run rate. Regardless, we expect net interest income to be at another all-time high next year.

Credit quality has been excellent and we expect it to remain strong in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we forecast
net charge offs at the lower end of our normal range of 20 basis points to 40 basis points. We believe we will
begin to see gradual normalization assuming the macroeconomic challenges remain manageable.
We expect fourth quarter non-interest income to decline approximately 3% from strong third quarter levels. We
expect pressures on derivatives, given recent elevated levels, deposit service charges from higher ECA rates, a
softening syndication market, and equity trends may impact fiduciary revenue. This is expected to be partly offset
by positive seasonal trends in areas such as card. As we look into 2023, we expect non-interest income to grow
as we start to see the benefit of our investments.
We expect fourth quarter expenses to grow approximately 2% to 3%, including expenses tied to revenue
generating related activity such as outside processing for card. In addition, we expect seasonally higher
occupancy, advertising, staff insurance as well as travel and entertainment expenses. This outlook excludes up to
$25 million of modernization initiatives that we anticipate in the fourth quarter. We believe these strategic
investments in our business will deliver value over time and are essential in meeting the evolving needs of our
customers and colleagues.
In 2023, we expect moderately higher staffing levels as the tight labor market eases and we continue to make
progress in implementing our revenue strategies. Given the market's performance, pension expense is likely to
move significantly higher. We also anticipate inflationary factors to impact many areas, such as salaries and
benefits, along with higher FDIC expense.
In summary, based on our expectations for the fourth quarter and our performance to-date, we believe we will
produce very strong and record revenue results this year. We have driven robust loan growth and strong fee
generation. In addition, we benefited from higher rates while executing our hedging strategy and careful
management of credit and expenses. We expect to carry our momentum into the fourth quarter and finish the year
strong.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. Many business lines are showing positive trends with strong loan growth in addition to increases
in commitments and a very solid pipeline. Our unique expertise and credit culture provide us a steady foundation
and help produce a record level of profitability while our investments in talent, technology and markets facilitate
continued growth to support our future.
Management of our balance sheet allows us to benefit from rising rates by reducing the impact from lower rates,
which we believe will provide a more consistent earnings trajectory through the cycles. It was a record quarter,
and I remain grateful for the continued commitment of my colleagues who are dedicated to ensure Comerica's
success. We believe we are well-positioned to deliver strong results as we end the year and move into 2023.
Before we take questions, I would like to recognize Darlene Persons, who recently announced her retirement after
a 36-year career with our company, 16 years as Director of Investor Relations, one of the longest serving IR
directors in the banking industry. She has steered us through many cycles. And her guide, it's not only to me and
our leadership team, but to our whole company, has been invaluable. I'd also like to introduce our new IR
Director, Kelly Gage, who's had an 18-year career with us, deep commercial banking background, most recently

as the National Director of Sales and Strategy for the Commercial Bank. Kelly will do a great job in her new role
as IR Director, and I know you'll look forward to getting to know her.
All right. So with that, we'd be happy to take your questions and open up the line.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] One moment, please, for our first question. And our first question comes from
the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, good morning. Congrats, Darlene. Just want to say congratulations. Just a question for you, Jim, on some of
the comments where you talked about I know you don't want to go into 2023 too much, but you talked about the
potential for 2023 potential for 2023 NII pulling back a little bit from Q4. Can you help us understand that a little bit
more and then just remind us of the overall goals of what you trying to do in this kind of rate environment in terms
of the rate hedging?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Well, good morning, Jon, and thank you for the question. I do think the fourth quarter run rate is a great
starting point in terms of how to start thinking about 2023. There are reasons we could be a little bit below that.
There are reasons we could be a little above it. If deposit betas catch up very quickly and on cumulative basis or
exceed 25% and/or deposit runoff continues through 2023, I think we could be below that run rate. On the other
hand, if deposit betas take some time to catch up, say, some time after the first quarter or through midyear and
deposits start to level off, the runoff starts to level off in the beginning of 2023, then I think there's a reasonable
chance we could be above that run rate. So I think it could go either direction. There are just some open
questions in terms of how deposit pricing will progress and how the runoff will progress over the next several
quarters. But again I would just say that I think the run rate in the fourth quarter is a pretty good place to start and
just be aware that there are some factors that could potentially move that down. But there is some upside to that
also.
In terms of what we're trying to accomplish, I think the message has been consistent. I think we've met the
objectives that we've set. We are trying to stabilize net interest income. We feel like we've achieved that. We've
left a little bit to the upside if rates do continue to go up as we approach the peak here. As I mentioned in my
comments, I don't think we're going to be doing any hedging activity other than replacing securities that run off
that would start in the next 12 months. If you look at in the appendix, we have a little bit of a maturity curve of our
swaps. And from that, you would infer that we're really going to work on forward starters that might start in later
2024, eventually, maybe even 2025. But we feel like we've taken care of business in the near-term. So we feel
really good about the positioning. We've essentially achieved by far, in a way, a record level of net interest
income, and at the same time partially protected that record level net interest income. So I think we've gotten to
where we want to be, and we're enjoying the fruits of that right now.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, that's fair. I am surprised by the increase in the margin. So that was nice to see. And I guess one more
question. I think I know the answer to it, but I've had a couple of emails back on my note this morning. Can you
touch a little bit on your tangible common equity ratio and how you view that? I know you may not think it's a big
deal, but some people ask about it. So can you just touch on how you think about that level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I continue to believe it's an optic, but nothing more than that. As I've mentioned before, from an economic
standpoint, the value of our deposits has gone up significantly offsetting, if not more than offsetting that loss on
securities and swaps. So, economically, we like what we're seeing. You see that in the results in terms of the
earnings as we stay in touch with various constituents, everyone in this synoptic that everyone struggles to find
really any substantial issue with it. So it's really not a point of concern for us. And I just think it's an odd looking
optic given the unprecedented run up in interest rates and really nothing more than that.

Hey, thank you for taking the question. Jim, I wanted to ask about the deposit levels. I think previously we'd sort of
been hoping the bulk of deposit runoff would finish in sort of fourth quarter or first quarter. You guys still have a
very, very low loan to deposit ratio. But I guess just curious on your thinking on sort of when or where we could
see the deposits level out and at what point would you want to get more aggressive on pricing to protect those
10

balances? In other words, just a little more color on the sort of the push and pull between volume and rate, in your
view.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yes. Scott, thank you for the question. First of all, I'll say that I think we're pretty comfortable with the pricing
approach up to this point. We obviously have a low year-to-date beta, low beta for the quarter. But being a
primarily a commercial bank, we feel like we do have these conversations with our customers. And to the extent,
we've lost deposits, it's been very knowingly and we certainly haven't lost any relationships. And we have the
ability to ramp up some of that exception pricing if we really need to, we have raised our standard pricing on the
retail side, which touches retail and wealth customers. So we feel real comfortable with the pricing approach.
But in terms of where deposit runoff goes, I really think it's going to be highly dependent on Fed policy. I think the
combination of QT as well as the rising rates, as you know, those two factors will drive what happens in 2023. We
obviously expect the runoff to continue through the fourth quarter at a similar pace that we've seen. I do want to
caveat that we could see some seasonal deposits in the fourth quarter as we often see. Seasonal trends have
been rendered a little bit not as reliable over the last odd two or three years. So it is possible we get some
seasonal deposits that mute that runoff in the fourth quarter. But I think that runoff would then just manifest in the
first quarter. I think it would be probably a temporary reprieve if we get those seasonal deposits.
But it's still our outlook that things start to level off early in 2023. I do think the Fed continues with QT for the next
year, year-and-a-half as they plan to I guess it's actually two years. You could see some deposits continue to run
off even after early 2023. But I'd like to remind people the Fed never did fully unwind its QE from previous cycles.
It seems very plausible to me they won't fully unwind it this cycle. You've already seen some literature in various
industry magazines that there are some concerns by the regulators and the Fed regarding just some of the
deposit runoff at banks. So at this point, our house case is still it starts to level off in early 2023. And we certainly
have plenty of efficient borrowing lines. We have access to broker deposits. We could even get more aggressive
in conversations with our customers in terms of where they place their money. So we feel like we have a lot of
optionality there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Wonderful. Thank you for that color. And then was hoping you could also discuss the higher modernization
costs in the fourth quarter. Will that be kind of a high watermark or would they continue much beyond the fourth
quarter or sort of end with the end of this calendar year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you for that question. I think that's an important one. Based on the initiatives that we've identified up
till now, I think the fourth quarter would be the high watermark. And that assumes we set up to $25 million.
There's always a chance some of these lease exits could be delayed till next year. So my answer obviously is
caveated based on the timing of when these actually happen. But if they do happen in the fourth quarter of 2022
as we expect, based on the initiatives we've identified, this would be the high watermark. Having said that, there
could be some additional initiatives that we identify over time. We're always talking about some of the potentials
out there. But this one will be a little bit more of an outsized one and could be the high watermark.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Good morning. I guess maybe just first question, I know banks are not really seeing anything in
terms of credit pain yet, but give us a sense of like the Fed [indiscernible] (00:33:59) interest rates, obviously it's
benefiting loan yields right now, but how are customers kind of absorbing these? Like are you worried about what
this may mean as we look out into next year in terms of just the ability of your customer base to live with 4% to
5% Fed funds rate, and just the level of visibility you have there in terms of all of a sudden seeing a big drop off in
how customers are able to service their debt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
So, it sounds like the question is, the ability of our customers to withstand the economic pressures of the higher
rates from a credit standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, this is Melinda. I would say that overall we feel really good about our customers' ability to kind of manage
through the current interest rate environment. Every time we do an underwriting, we stress interest rates whether
we're in a low rate environment or a high rate environment. And we think we do a really nice job of making sure
that whatever the debt load is of the customer, that they've got the ability to manage through that. We also have a
relatively low leverage book overall. So, the actual leverage portfolio would be the one that we're watching really
closely. Obviously, given their debt levels, they are more sensitive. But we also use strategies like swaps and
fixing rates in order to make sure that we can protect the cash flow and the company's ability to kind of repay the
debt. So, overall, I think we feel really good about our customers' ability to navigate the environment.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
$3 billion. And just want to follow up Jim, on the asset side, we saw about 100 basis points increase quarter-over-
quarter. Just talk to us in terms of how you see that asset yields trending, going from year in terms of any spread
compression that you expect or the 100 basis points relative to the rate hikes we saw in the third quarter that
should hold for the next few quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I think these metrics will largely hold up. This was struck on [ph] 9/30 (00:35:57) as a model run. And as
deposits run off, you could see a little bit of movement in those calculations. But I think the rule of thumb will hold
pretty well.

No, loan yields will continue to go up in the fourth quarter over the third quarter.

James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Well, we are not buying securities, as I mentioned at this time. We are letting the securities
run off. They're running off kind of in that [ph] 215, 217 (00:36:42) range, just slightly above the overall portfolio
average. So, I expect securities yields to stay pretty flat. I mean, you could see some very minor yield movement
down quarter-to-quarter, but it's going to be almost unnoticeable, I think, given how close the runoff is to the
overall portfolio yield.

Good Morning, John.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning. Just wondering if I get a little bit more detail on slide 13, I know you broke out that you see a $35
million NII benefit under your standard model. But assuming a 25% cumulative at the beta you could see a $35
million NII decline, pretty notable delta between the two. And is that maybe can you walk us through the puts and
takes, is it primarily just the beta assumption or are there other aspects there that led to such a noteworthy swing?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
That is the beta assumption that's driving that. So, if you do the math, the beta obviously is having a $70 million
impact relative to the 100 basis points up. So that's how you swing from $35 million positive to $35 million
negative. We did have that cumulative beta kind of feathering in over the 12 months. So if it came as a shock, it
could even be higher. But it is important to note that in our fourth quarter guidance, we actually have a lot of this
cumulative beta in there. In fact, we get up to about a 17% cumulative beta by the end of the fourth quarter. So I
think you can take some assurance by the fact that our guidance already has about half of this cumulative beta in
it already. So you've probably – you got the other half of the cumulative beta, you probably closer to zero as
opposed to this negative $35 million. So, just some additional color for you there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Got it. Okay. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up to Ebrahim's question. You mentioned that you're letting
securities run off, but are you – just to clarify, are you reinvesting the cash flows back into the bond book and
what are those reinvestment yields?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, to be clear, we are not reinvesting them into the bond book. We are using this run off to fund our loan
growth, which we expect to continue to stay strong. And so, for the – probably for the next – for the foreseeable
future at least, we will not be buying securities. We think this is the most efficient way to fund our loan growth.

Okay. Got it. And then if I could just ask one more, back to the TCE topic, I know that you indicated that it's more
optic from your point of view. So given that, how low are you willing to let that TCE to TA ratio go below that 4.82
level where it's at now. And does that influence you in any way at all when it comes to buyback interest, when it
comes to repurchases? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, you know, I mean, large – it's largely out of our control, of course, you know, based on where interest rates
go and how low that goes. But I can tell you there is no magical number that we are focused on. And I would just
reiterate that we don't think it's a concern. We don't think it should be a concern of others. And again, I just think
it's an oddity of the times that we're seeing this type of movement, not just at Comerica, but to some extent at
other banks too.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning. I had a follow-up question on the deposit side. You obviously talked about the
expected decline from your – one thing that's been interesting is that the interest bearing has been declining
faster than the non-interest bearing. It looks like you're about up to 57% non-interest bearing. Can you help us
understand how you expect that mix to traject? Do you think you can actually uphold this better mix of free
funding versus maybe what had happened in past cycles? Or is that just a TBD still as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Thanks for the question, Ken. This is this was a little bit of a surprise to us too for the mix to actually improve
towards the higher non-interest bearing. So we have done a little research into that and talk to customers and just
analyzed various customers' accounts. My conclusion is, number one, we're just seeing the price sensitivity at this
point of the cycle, more on the interest bearing side. I do think it will tip to the non-interest bearing side eventually,
but it feels like customers are first more price sensitive on the interest bearing side of this.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
The other thing that we found kind of confirms the suspicion that we've had all along and that's something that's
been very similar to previous cycles where we've come out of some stress. We do see the corporate treasurers
are carrying higher safety net levels of cash, and that explains why they're maybe going to their interest bearing
accounts first to the extent they have use of funds. So I think those higher safety nets will probably be around for
some time.
The other anecdotally, interesting thing that I don't know how large of a factor it is, but it might be a growing factor,
you know, we have heard from some corporate treasurers that real-time payments is making it more
unpredictable or more difficult to predict cash flows. And so, they're keeping some higher cash levels for that
reason also. And that's something that might grow over time.
So those are some of the observations that we've made. We do think it will reverse to some extent eventually. But
I'd mentioned in the last earnings call that I thought it would get back to the historical 50/50 ratio, if not slightly
below where we've been historically. I'm now questioning whether or not we really get back there, given the
higher levels of safety net cash that these corporate treasurers are taking or holding. So I do think it'll reverse, but
there's some question as to whether or not it's really ever going to get back to that 50/50 mix.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, great color. Thank you. And second question, just on some of the loan buckets, I know you're talking about
1% growth sequentially average in the fourth quarter, but there's always a little bit of ups and downs in some of
those National businesses. Can you just run us through some of the most important trends that you're seeing
noting the really big CRE growth this quarter and then you expect a decline in mortgage. Just kind of a – the ins
and outs of that period-end versus average difference as we look ahead. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Ken, it's Peter, right. I think as we get into the fourth quarter, we continue to feel pretty directionally positive
about – just about all of our businesses. I think in the comments we talked about broad-based loan growth, and
for the first time in a long time, all of our businesses are seeing really good loan growth. The only kind of real
headwind does continue to be mortgage banking finance going into the fourth quarter, I think for obvious reasons
of challenges in that space with higher interest rates and lower housing inventory, but the rest of our sort of larger
businesses, as you mentioned, Commercial Real Estate, we expect Equity Fund Services to have a good quarter.
Corporate Banking continues to be on a good trajectory, albeit, we also don't know that the fourth quarter looks
like the third quarter, but it is positive trending and going into the end of the year. So we're pretty excited about
sort of what we're seeing on those larger businesses.
Dealer continues to slightly creep up. We get asked a lot about when that will return. And I don't know the answer
to that, but quarter-over-quarter, you're starting to see a little bit of floor plan usage and we continue to be a very
active lender in that space. And as I mentioned, I financed some of the M&A activity that you're seeing in dealer.
So it's nice to see a little bit of usage there as well.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, congratulations to Darlene and welcome to Kelly. You mentioned
in the monologue you're starting to see signs of normalization of credit. Could you give us some more color on
that? And I believe you saw a slight increase in criticized loans from TLS area. Could you give us some color from
that as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jennifer, thanks for the question, it's Melinda. You know, overall, we're really pleased with how the really the
entire portfolio has performed. And we have guided the last couple of quarters that at some point there's going to
be some normalization of the credit metrics from these really, really historic low levels. And that's what we're
starting to see, but very, very modest level of softening of performance in a couple of portfolios. And those
portfolios as I already mentioned would be leveraged portfolio just given kind of the nature of that book. We watch
that very, very closely. It continues to have some modest level of elevated, elevated criticized and criticized
assets.
We're also watching the automotive portfolio. That's not a huge portfolio for us about $1 billion and they have had
obviously a lot of challenges coming out of the pandemic, the chip shortages and then just kind of layer on all the
other inflationary pressures. And then technology and life sciences that business by its very nature also has a
more elevated level of risk just given the fact that we do early stage and mid-stage and some late stage
companies and some of those late stage companies also tend to be leveraged. So we don't see anything in the
portfolio that is giving us a lot of pause or a lot of reason for concern. And we have the rest of the portfolio which
quite frankly continues to perform extremely well. So, I would say, kind of leverage, automotive and TLS are the
areas that we're watching. And, yes, we did see a slight increase in the criticized but our NPAs and our inflow to
NPAs remained very, very well-behaved.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks. Hey, good morning. Following up on your credit commentary, could you give a little bit more color on the
increase in the reserve rate and where you would expect that to go if unemployment were to increase to say 5%
or 5.5%? Just curious for some of the assumptions underlying the current rate and where it could go under those
circumstances. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Sure. This is Melinda again. And as you know, the CECL process happens every single quarter and it's really
highly dependent on the economic forecast at that time, as well as the performance of the portfolio. So what we
saw this quarter was a forecast, an economic forecast that was slightly deteriorated from where we were at the
end of the second quarter, although it was still positive, unemployment about 4% and GDP moderating below 1%
for the next 12 months or so. We use that base case scenario as well as a downside case. And in our downside
case, we've already accounted for much higher unemployment in the range of 6% to 8%, as well as negative GDP
all the way through 2023. So we believe that we have accurately and adequately captured the risk of a downside
scenario in a recession in the reserves. And we do that by the use of the qualitative. So, we feel really good about
our coverage ratio right now. Again, if you look at our four-quarter trailing net charge-offs, you look at what our
NPAs are, and then the overall strength of the book overall, I think our coverage ratio right now is reflective with
an adequate amount of conservatism.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So, following up on that, could you give a little bit more color on the weightings that you ascribe to each of those
scenarios? And perhaps if we did enter into that more greater downside scenario where unemployment goes
higher. To what extent you would ascribe a higher weighting to that scenario and the impact that would have on
the overall reserve rate?

Yeah, we don't like weight the scenario specifically. We use a baseline scenario and look at the entire portfolio
from a quantitative perspective. And then we use that downside case, on certain portfolios and an overlay to the
entire portfolio. So if you looked at the mix between our quantitative and qualitative is about 60/40, and that's
been pretty consistent over the last couple of quarters and it's very meaningful to the total reserve. So, again, I
think we feel really confident that we've captured the downside risk at least over the life of our portfolio, which is
important to remember that's a relatively short duration portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's helpful. Thank you. And then separately, following up on the tangible capital questions, your investment
securities portfolio is classified as available for sale, which stands in contrast to many of your peers that have a
larger mix of held to maturity and very clear that you view the OCI marks associated with higher rates is optical.
But some investors have expressed concern that we could enter a credit cycle that would exacerbate the rate
mark headwinds. Could you speak to that dynamic and whether there's anything that would lead you to consider
using the held to maturity designation or perhaps thinking differently about tangible capital?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Bill, at this point, I don't anticipate us making any movements, even if you're inclined to move something to
held to maturity, you probably wouldn't do it at this point in the cycle. So, we just continue to be comfortable. I
know a lot of the larger banks that don't have AOCI shielded from capital do have a lot of HTM and a lot of our
peers did not have much an HTM, some have moved, some in recently or over time after some of the losses had
already occurred. But we continue to be comfortable there. And again, I believe it's an optic that won't cause any
real issue for us.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2022
I want to start, so when you look at non-interest bearing deposits, which have seen a very material increase over
the past two years, if you dig down to the account level, how much larger are the account balances today? And
can you size for us the balance that could be at risk? Jim, I heard your commentary about treasurers carrying
more of a safety net, but let's face it, that could easily go into three month T-bills, right? It doesn't need to stay at
the bank. So can you size that for us?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yes. Steven, good morning. Certainly when we look at average balance per account, that is the main driver, that's
the largest driver in terms of the higher deposits. That's not too surprising to me. I think it is consistent with the
theme of corporate treasurers carrying higher safety net levels of cash. I do think there could be a tipping point
where once they move some of the price sensitive, interest bearing deposits, eventually we will probably see a
little bit of migration down of the non-interest bearing deposits. So I think that day will come. But for now they
seem to be more price sensitive on the interest bearing side. And I do think there's a limit to how far they'll take
down their non-interest bearing. I think they are very comfortable with the levels of non-interest bearing they have.
And I'll remind you or maybe educate those out there that a lot of our customers have multiple legal entities,
sometimes complex structures. It's not as easy as you might think for them to move cash around to these different
structures on hours or days' notice. So they do like to keep their various entities well-funded with non-interest
bearing DDA and I think there's a limit to how far it will come down, but I do think it'll come down at some point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jim and Steve, I might add too. This is Curt. Just to remind you around the complexity of our deposit book. I mean
we have a heavy concentration of commercial deposits and a heavy concentration of Wealth Management
deposits where we've got very close relationships with those customers. We know sort of what they're doing, they
talk to us through frequent communication around deposit flow, treasury management and movement of funds, et
cetera. And so, it's not like a very granular mass market retail portfolio where you really don't have sort of a lot of
sight in conversations occurring with those customers. So we're going to continue to do the right thing in terms of
pricing and taking care of those relationships. But we are in frequent communication. We've got a good sense of
sort of what people are planning to do or not do with deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. And I will add on I mean, keep in mind that, being a very strong treasury management bank, a lot of our
DDAs are tied into ECA. So, the customer is getting some degree value and incentive to keep their non-interest-
bearing for that reason too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
If we stay with that theme of having a good line of sight to what customers are thinking or they might eventually
do, if we take that and apply it to whatever the fourth quarter NIM is. I know, Jim, you said there's a lot of variables
right? We know that. But what's your base case or where we go through 2023 from the 4Q NIM based on this line
of sight that you guys have into your customer base.

Yeah. I never, because of our commercial orientation and variability with cash balances that we've seen through
the years as well as what we're doing with our securities book which effects the mix of the balance sheet, we've
always been and continue to be very hesitant to provide NIM percentage guidance, if that's what you're asking.
So I would just maybe revert back to the guidance that we do expect deposits to level off sometime in early 2023
and things to stabilize from that standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Fair enough. And if I could squeeze one more, I'm just trying to put together all of the commentary around

growth next year.

Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Terry.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. Good – hi, good morning. Last quarter, you added an EVP from a larger bank to run payments for
Comerica. I'm wondering if you just talk about the investments needed, kind of what the strategy is there and what
the revenue opportunities are going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Hey, Terry, this is Peter. Yeah. We're very excited about our investment in payments. I mean, we continue to
believe that we have a real opportunity to be a leading bank in that space, particularly with commercial customers.
But across our entire enterprise, we think there's a lot of opportunities in our treasury management business.
What we do in card, Jim talked a little bit about what's going on in real-time payments. All of those are
opportunities that the Comerica has to be a leader. And there's a lot of ways you can be competitive. You don't
have to be the big bank necessarily at this point to be successful. And we think we've got a real agile approach

and have the ability to partner with lots of different ways to be successful. So it's a space that we're excited about.
We did hire some talent there, both on the payment side and in our tech and ops side. We're also investing there
as well. So we're very excited about what we see on that on that horizon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up, I just want to make sure have you maintain the relationships with
all the dealers over the last two years or said in another way when inventory builds, do you expect to maintain that
market share and kind of go back to where it was pre-2000?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Well, Terry, yeah, two questions there. Have we maintained the relationships? Absolutely, we have. You know, so
we're very active in the space, talked to customers a lot, have added customers. I continue to believe that we are
going to be on the winning side of the M&A activity because we do focus on sort of the mega dealers, whether or
not inventory levels return to, you know, to your question, when those return, I don't know. If they were to return to
historical levels, then we would certainly benefit from it. But I think, as I said, you're going to continue to just sort
of see a slight uptick in floor plan usage over the coming years. And we believe we will be there to capitalize on
that.
