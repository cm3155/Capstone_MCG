William Henry Rogers
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Ankur. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We hope that your new year is off to a
good start and that you and your families are doing well.
I am very pleased with Truist strong fourth quarter results. Fee income was solid, reflecting our diverse business
mix and favorable conditions in investment banking and insurance. Net interest income is starting to improve
exceeding expectations. Credit quality was outstanding resulting in another provision benefit. We delivered on our
expense goals as adjusted noninterest expense decreased almost 4% and drove 3% sequential positive
operating leverage. Loan growth excluding PPP is strengthening and we have momentum going into this year. I'll
share more details on this topic during the presentation.
Now turning to slide 4, as always I'm going to begin with purpose which is to inspire and build better lives and
communities. We believe our purpose-driven culture is the foundation for our success as a company. Our purpose
defines how we do business every day and it serves as a framework for how we make decisions. Our purpose-

driven culture is also the foundation for how we attract and retain top talent. People simply want to work for and
do business with companies that stand for something meaningful. This culture combined with our comprehensive
compensation and benefit package is significant and ongoing training, development and career mobility and our
more flexible approach to work will be your formula for attracting and retaining the best talent at Truist and
competing and winning in the ongoing war for talent.
Slide 5 highlights some of the ways we're putting our purpose into action. This slide is organized around the same
major themes contained in our CSR and our ESG report since they're topics that are most relevant to all of our
stakeholders including our shareholders. I cannot be more proud of both the quantity and most importantly the
quality of the work being done across all these dimensions and the tremendous impact we are having in our
communities.
While I can't cover every point on the slide, let me highlight a few. On the technology front we were excited to
welcome our teammates to the recently completed Innovation and Technology Center in Charlotte and look
forward to our external grand opening in the first of the year.
As you know, Truist has an unwavering commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. And I'm very pleased to
report that we recently achieved our goal to increase ethnically diverse representation in senior leadership roles to
at least 15%, this was a year earlier than our original commitment. While we're proud to have achieved this
milestone, we acknowledge that this is actually the beginning and not the end.
We have also intentionally implemented a flexible work strategy for our teammates which includes onsite, remote
and hybrid options. Hybrid and more flexible work's here to stay. And I've learned the meaning and the power of
intentional flexibility, the concept of people coming together as a team whether in the office or not and intentional
deciding descending what works best for them, their team, our clients and the company while remaining highly
engaged and most importantly purposeful.
Finally we released our inaugural TCFD report in mid-December which adds further context and disclosures to
our previous CSR and ESG reports. At Truist we view all the elements of ESG as an opportunity to improve our
company and operationalize our purpose, including climate change. For instance, we're adding new teammates
within CIB in our commercial community bank who are going to help our clients' transition to a lower carbon
economy.
Now turning to slide 7. This quarter we had $163 million of after-tax merger-related and restructuring charges and
$165 million of after-tax incremental operating expenses related to the merger. The total EPS impact of merger-
related costs was $0.25 a share. While our decision to create a best of both model of integration has resulted in
increased upfront cost, I firmly believe it creates the best platform for future investment and growth. The good
news is that total merger cost will be cut approximately in half in 2022 compared to last year and then fall out of
our expense base entirely after this year.
Now turning to our fourth quarter performance on slide 8. As I indicated, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a
solid year as most areas were generally in line or somewhat ahead of our expectations. We're at $1.5 billion or
$1.13 earnings per share for the quarter on a reported basis. Excluding the merger impacts on the prior slide,
we're at $1.9 billion or $1.38 per share. Primary driver of changes in EPS relative to both the prior quarter and
year ago was a loan loss provision given a rapidly evolving economic environment over the past two years.
We generated strong returns including a 22.6% adjusted ROTCE which was unchanged from last quarter.
Excluding the reserve release, adjusted ROTCE was a still a very strong 19.6%. Asset quality continues to be an

excellent story and net charge-offs were in line with our guidance. Capital deployment was robust during the
fourth quarter as we funded strong organic loan growth, closed the Service Finance acquisition in early December
and repurchased $500 million worth of common stock. We'll provide more details about loan growth momentarily.
On the merger integration front, we completed the first part of the core bank conversion in mid-October by
migrating our heritage BB&T clients to the Truist ecosystem. As part of the conversion we launched the new
Truist.com as well as our digital commerce account opening platform. Since then our integration teams have
completed two successful dress rehearsals for a final conversion, one in mid-December and one just this past
weekend. I want to personally thank our teammates for their hard work and dedication to this effort. Because of
them, we're on track for the final core conversion in February during which our heritage SunTrust clients will be
migrated to the Truist ecosystem.
Looking at full year 2021, Truist had a productive year across multiple dimensions. From a financial perspective
we generated significant adjusted net income of $7.5 billion or $5.53 per share and had an adjusted ROTCE of
22%. While our earnings undoubtedly benefited from a $3 billion lower loan loss provision due to the improvement
in economy, we also demonstrated the strength of our diverse business mix.
Fee income, excluding security gains increased a very strong 10% as we're firing on multiple cylinders. This
performance helped offset a 45% decline in mortgage fee income and a 6% decrease in net interest income.
We also continue to deliver on our cost-save programs evidenced by an adjusted expenses increasing only 1%
during the year which saw much larger increases in fee income. We also experienced a reduction in our risk
profile due to improvement in economy and merger integration progress which enabled us to reduce the CET1
target by 25 basis points to 9.75% and deploy significantly more capital. Overall, we were able to make great
progress on multiple fronts despite continued headwinds from the pandemic while delivering improved financial
performance for our shareholders.
Turning to slide 10. Our new Truist digital experience reflects two of our core digital and technology principles; co-
creation with our clients, and moving fast in order to learn fast. Our more modern and agile platform allows us to
incorporate this feedback quickly. The results of which can be seen in the significant improvements in our overall
client satisfaction scores as well as in our Apple App Store and Google Play Store ratings in just a few short
months.
We've now migrated approximately 9 million retail, wealth and small business clients to the Truist digital
experience through December. More than 85% of active clients have begun to use the new digital platform in lieu
of their heritage app.
On slide 11 you will see a visual of our new corporate and commercial digital platform which we call Truist One
View. This platform will provide our clients with a comprehensive view of their existing treasury management and
lending solutions via streamlined and client-specific experience designed to reduce the time required to perform
routine financial task.
Including the launch of Truist One View to our commercial clients, Truist has introduced new web and mobile
platforms for each of our client segments across retail, wealth, business and corporate. More than 2,000 features
were released across these platforms in 2021, and we've done this at the pace that neither heritage company
could have achieved on their own.

More broadly as you can see from the charts on the left, we continue to position ourselves to serve the robust
demand for digital services. Digital lending, mobile check deposits and Zelle transactions all exhibited double-digit
growth during the year.
We feel good about our current digital performance and we believe that our progress will accelerate after the final
core bank conversion, in part due to the advantages and efficiencies associated with having one website, one
search engine optimization process, one brand, one system and one digital application, but also in part due to the
new capabilities that we'll be able to introduce this year, including our new AI-driven Insights tool, our new Truist
virtual assistant and the Truist developer center which will position us to innovate and collaborate with the
developer community. Having our teams focus on the new Truist experience versus managing three separate
experiences will provide a significant productivity lift as we move forward.
Lastly, we have plans to make strong digital progress in other areas this year from our new partnership and
integration with AutoFi, enhancing our insurtech capabilities via integrating insurance directly into our mortgage
process, and launching a new deposit product with LightStream on a real-time cloud-based core.
Now turning to loans and leases on slide 12. Average loans stabilized after decreasing for five consecutive
quarters and peeling back the onion reveals positive and improving underlying trends. Excluding PPP, average
loans increased approximately 1% sequentially and end of period loans grew approximately 2% reflecting
momentum late in the quarter. The most notable improvement was in C&I where end of period balances,
excluding PPP, grew $6.3 billion, or 5%, reflecting broad-based growth across corporate and commercial lines of
business. This was the strongest point-to-point C&I loan growth since the first quarter of 2020.
Most CIB industry and product groups demonstrated growth, most notably within our asset finance group. Broad-
based growth was also evident within our commercial community bank where 12 of the 21 regions grew C&I
loans, excluding PPP, during the quarter and we continue to see the most growth in markets that are relatively
more open.
Every single one of our industry specialty groups within the CCB grew, a strong reflection of how our clients value
industry expertise and advice. Revolver utilization also ticked up after six straight quarters of declines and, equally
important, total revolver exposure continues to grow, evidence of our relevance and that our clients are building
capacity for investments and expansion.
Residential mortgage continues to grow reflecting slower prepayment speeds, our decision to balance sheet
certain correspondent production and increase capacity post conversions and COVID. Excluding mortgage
consumer balances decreased slightly primarily due to seasonality in our Sheffield business and continued
declines in our government guaranteed student loan portfolio.
Service Finance closed on December 6, and we feel great about their trajectory heading into 2022. In addition,
some of the areas that have been headwinds like dealer floor plan and CRE are beginning to stabilize. Overall,
corporate and commercial clients remain optimistic despite ongoing labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and
inflationary pressures. We're encouraged by the momentum we observed in the fourth quarter but also in our
pipelines which are the highest they've been in some time.
We continue to believe there is meaningful upside to the C&I growth story as the economy continues to improve
although the timing remains imprecise. We also continue to feel confident in our consumer trajectory as we're well
positioned with respect to faster growing segments through our digital and point-of-sale businesses which will
offset headwinds in other areas.

Now, turning to deposits on slide 13. Average deposits increased $8.2 billion or 2% compared to the third quarter,
largely due to the continuing effects of recent government stimulus and seasonality related to public funds. We
were also able to help our clients along their financial journey through our industry-leading Child Tax Credit
awareness initiative. Through this initiative, which promotes savings and financial confidence, clients and
communities most in need were able to grow their savings and IRA balances by 9% and 15%, respectively, from
May through December. I think this is a great example of what we call purposeful growth.
But we know we could do more and as guided by our purpose, we have been reinventing a new checking account
experience that aligns with our clients' needs which we believe will provide them more flexibility, lower cost and
more financial confidence. Truist One Banking will be our new flagship differentiated and disruptive suite of
checking solutions that redefine everyday banking and accelerate our journey towards purposeful growth.
Truist One will have zero overdraft fees, a capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need via a
simple $100 negative balance buffer as well as a deposit base credit line limit of up to $750. These features will
help clients manage their liquidity needs far more cost-effectively than alternative products. You're going to learn
more about these details right after this call. These solutions will be available to all clients this summer given our
need to first finish the conversion. In addition, Truist will discontinue overdraft protection, negative account
balance and return item fees in the coming months for all existing accounts.
Long term, this is a win-win for all of our stakeholders as we'll increase client acquisition particularly next gen
clients, enhance deposit growth and simply improve the overall client experience. In the near term, however, there
will be a financial cost, both as the result of the introduction of Truist One and the reduction of other fees.
We expect these changes collectively to result in an approximately $300 million or an almost 60% reduction in
overdraft related revenue by 2024. The impact will begin in a few months and build over time as more clients
benefits from the Truist One experience.
I'm now going to turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in more detail.

Daryl N. Bible
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone.
Turning to slide 14. Net interest income was up slightly versus the prior quarter and ahead of our guidance of
down 1%. The increase was primarily driven by larger securities portfolio as a result of ongoing deposit growth,
which offset the expected decline in purchase accounting accretion. Net interest margin and core net interest
margin performed in line with our guidance. Reported net interest margin declined 5 basis points, 2 basis points
due to purchase accounting accretion and 3 basis points from core. The main drivers of the 3 basis points decline
in core net interest margin were the impacts of lower PPP revenue and higher levels of liquidity. The PPP
continues to wind down and we expect to earn an additional $60 million of PPP revenue over the coming two
quarters.
Moving to slide 15. Overall Truist intentionally maintained a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk,
enhancing current earnings while being in position to take advantage of higher rates both at the short and long
ends of the curve. We estimate a 100-basis-point ramp – increase in rates would increase NII by 5%, a 100-basis-
point shock would increase NII by 10%. Approximately 75% of this reported asset sensitivity is from the short end
of the curve

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
As a rule of thumb 125 basis points Fed hike with a 25% beta would increase net interest income by $25 million
per month, and increase net interest income margin 6 basis points, all else being equal.
Moving to slide 16, reported fees were down 2% from last quarter largely due to changes in our nonqualified
plans. Absent the impacts of the nonqualified plan, fees performed well and we're consistent with the guidance of
relatively stable. The driving factors of a stable performance quarter-over-quarter were investment banking and
trading increased $61 million versus the prior quarter due to higher syndication fees, structured real estate and
record M&A results.
Insurance income increased $21 million primarily due to organic growth and seasonal improvement from the third
to fourth quarter. These quarterly increases were offset by a decline in other income of $107 million, or $70 million
excluding changes in the nonqualified plan, largely driven by the valuation adjustments for the Visa related
derivative and lower revenue from our SBIC funds. For the full year 2021, excluding security gains, fees were up
10% versus the prior year of more than $800 million.
Propelled by our diverse business model, favorable market conditions and Truist increasing size, scale and
relevance across multiple businesses, we're also making good progress early in our IRM initiative, particularly
connectivity between CCB, wealth and CIB. Insurance income increased 20% year-over-year primarily driven by a
very strong organic growth of 11% and acquisitions. This was our 99th year of insurance business, our best one
yet and we believe that 2022, our 100th year can be even better. Investment banking and trading was also up
over $400 million largely due to record performances of syndicated finance, M&A, equity, structured real estate
and asset securitization.
M&A revenue doubled relative to 2020 and the lead syndication rose and – and syndicated finance were up 26%
year-over-year both reflecting our strategic relevance to our clients. On the flip side residential mortgage income
was down year-over-year $445 million or 45%, primarily due to the sharp decline on gain on sale margins and
lower refinance activity.
Turning to slide 17. Reported expenses were $3.7 billion for the quarter, including $212 million of merger-related
costs and $215 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Adjusted expenses decreased
3.9% sequentially at the – end of our guidance of down 3% to 4%. Drivers for the decline include decreased
personnel costs which were a result of lower salary expenses, lower incentive costs, lower medical claims and
changes in the nonqualified plan. Average FTEs declined 3% including Service Finance from the prior quarter.
Adjusted expenses also declined due to elevated equipment and marketing expenses in the third quarter. Full
year adjusted expenses were up only 1% despite the adjusted fee income growing 10% year-over-year. This
limited increase demonstrates the cost saving success we have achieved throughout the year and our overall
discipline and expense management.
Moving to slide 18. Asset quality remains excellent reflecting our prudent risk culture, diverse portfolio, favorable
economic conditions and the effects of stimulus. Our net charge-off ratio increased to 25 basis points from 19
basis points in the third quarter due to seasonality and the consumer losses and lesser commercial recoveries.
Our ALLL coverage ratio decreased to 1.53% which is just below our CECL Day 1 levels, resulting in a provision
benefit of $103 million in the fourth quarter as the economic scenarios continue to improve.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
Continuing on slide 19. Capital and liquidity levels remained very strong. Our CET1 ratio declined from 10.1% to
9.6% driven by organic loan growth, share repurchases and the Service Finance acquisition. Our established
near-term target for CET1 of 9.75% has not changed although the ratio declined to 9.6% in the fourth quarter. We
anticipate being somewhat below our or 9.75% CET1 target in the near term given the improving loan growth
outlook and the CECL phase-in for the first quarter. We also do not anticipate repurchasing any share for the first
half of 2022.
Moving to slide 21. We achieved major milestone in October with the successful migration of our BB&T retail and
commercial clients to the Truist ecosystem. We have three significant integration milestones remaining;
completing the Truist digital first migration, finalizing the remaining of branch consolidations in the first quarter,
and the migration of our SunTrust retail and commercial clients to the Truist ecosystem which will occur in
February.
The visual culmination of this process will be 6,000 more Truist signs across our markets, at branches, ATMs,
retail and corporate offices, finally allowing us to serve as one brand for our clients. Once the integration is
complete and all the systems have been converted Truist will be a much simpler company to operate, allowing us
to provide even better service to our clients.
Turning to slide 22. We continue to be committed to achieving our $1.6 billion of net cost saves and continue to
make progress in each of the five categories. Third-party spend is down 11.5% from baseline levels exceeding
our targeted reduction of 10%. Our sourcing team continues to make great strides in achieving savings despite
the impacts of inflation, and the good news is there are a fewer contracts to renegotiate in 2022 due to the higher
volume of contracts renegotiated during Truist first two years. We are on track to deliver over 800 total branch
closures by the first quarter of 2022. And we're about 90% of the way towards our non-branch facility reduction
target. Average FTEs are down 11% since the merger, excluding acquisitions. Additionally, technology savings
will materialize after redundant systems are decommissioned the second half of 2022.
Turning to slide 23. Core noninterest expense was $2.94 billion in the fourth quarter, meeting our target for the
quarter. As a reminder, core noninterest expense is more comparable to our baseline expenses at the time the
merger closed. Going forward we will focus primarily on adjusted expenses and not core as adjusted expenses
represent what we believe will be the run rate going forward.
I will now provide guidance for the full year 2022 and for the first quarter. In 2022, we expect total revenue to grow
2% to 4% from 2021 as a result of higher noninterest income combined with solid growth in fees. The lower end of
the range reflects two Fed hikes with one in June and the second in December where the upper end reflects three
to four rate hikes throughout the year. This guidance includes the initial financial impact from the new Truist One
account and related fee reductions in 2022.
Adjusted noninterest expense is expected to only increase 1% to 2% in 2022, as a result of inflation, increased
investments and expenses from acquisitions in 2021, partially offset by the ongoing cost savings including
achieving our final cost-save target in the fourth quarter of 2022. Merger-related and restructuring costs and
incremental operating expenses related to the merger are anticipated to be approximately $800 million in 2022
with these expenses going away in 2023. Given these factors, we anticipate positive operating leverage on both a
GAAP and adjusted basis in 2022. This is the primary metric we will hold ourselves accountable to this year.
We also expect net charge-offs ratio to be between 30 and 40 basis points in 2022, given favorable economic
conditions and the assumptions for normalization throughout the year with some quarter-to-quarter variability.

Excluding discrete items, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20% and 21% if you model us on a
taxable-equivalent basis.
Looking into the first quarter, we expect total revenues to decline approximately 1% to 2% from fourth quarter
levels, given two fewer days, lower purchase accounting accretion and PPP revenue, continued pressures on
mortgage and the typical seasonal patterns in certain fee categories like payments and service charges. This will
partially offset by seasonality and insurance.
Reported net interest margin should be down a couple basis points due to lower purchase accounting accretion.
Although, we expect core to be relatively flat. We expect adjusted expenses to increase 1% to 2% next quarter
from the fourth quarter levels, partially due to the seasonality and personnel expense given FICA and 401(k) and
partially due to higher marketing expense as we continue to roll out the Truist brand post conversions.
Now, I'll turn it back to Bill to conclude.

William Henry Rogers
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Daryl.
Slide 24 is our investment thesis which is built on four pillars or themes that we believe truly differentiate Truist
and allow us to inspire and build better lives and communities as well as deliver purposeful growth for all of our
stakeholders. I also think it's the same reason I've got the best job in banking. I shared color on this refreshed
investment thesis with many of you in December.
So, on slide 25 and in summary and conclusion, Truist had a very good 2021, highlighted by improved financial
performance, strong fee income from our diverse business model, significant capital deployment and strong risk
management as evidenced by our excellent asset quality metrics. We also made substantial integration progress
taking many significant steps towards becoming One Truist.
As we look into 2022, our formula is going to be simple. First, we'll complete the merger in the first quarter,
eliminate merger related costs by year end and achieve our cost saves, all of which will help us produce positive
operating leverage.
Second, we will begin to pivot from an integration focus to an operating focus on executional excellence and
growth. The momentum we have going into 2022 combined with being One Truist across all dimensions,
technology, digital, brand, products, process, gives me great confidence in our performance and potential as we
make and complete this pivot. Lastly, we'll have the capacity to deploy more capital on behalf of our clients and
shareholders as integration risks subside and the economy stays on sound footing.
So, with that let me turn it back over to Ankur for Q&A.

Hey, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I was hoping to follow up on the expense guidance of 1% to 2% growth on adjusted basis. There's obviously
some puts and takes with the cost saves and the Service Finance. What are you thinking about underlying
expense growth? I think, Daryl, you talked about 3% back in November, and is that still true or how do we think
about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Matt. I think we were at the conference, in the [ph] fourth (00:33:44) quarter, we said we would have around
3% inflation, that's about $400 million, what we're ballparking for us for next year. We have the benefit obviously
of having our third tranche of cost-saves coming through in 2022 which really makes the adjusted expense growth
pretty moderate versus not having those cost-saves.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Hi, what's up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
On your revenue guide of 2% to 4%, maybe could you just help us figure out how that would break down, if you
can unpack that by net interest income versus fees, maybe give us little bit of color how we should think about
growth in 2022 on those fronts? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, John. So, if you look at my prepared remarks, we talk about net interest income, we really right now have in
our base forecast only two Fed increases, one in June and one in December. That's the lower end of the revenue
guide. Obviously, if you look at the forwards markets where they are today, it's I think 3.8 times, so almost four
Fed moves factored in. That would get us to the higher end of the curve.
We gave you a couple metrics, we're using a 25% beta in our rate sensitivity. And the 25% beta equates to about
$25 million per month for every Fed increase that we have there. If you look back historically and look at the
recession that we had and when Fed started to raise rates in 2015 and 2016, the betas for the first 100 basis
points were 15% and we're modeling 25%. So, I think we're little bit conservative on that side. We'll see how
things play out. We are modeling a higher beta when you go up over 100 basis points to the next [ph] 100 – or
(00:36:04) 35 basis points and then anything over 35 basis points, we're at a 50% beta is kind of the assumptions
we're using.
On the fee side, we feel pretty [indiscernible] (00:36:15) growth on the fee side, we had momentum there. We had
a tremendous year in 2021. We still think we will continue to have pretty good pull-through of revenue with the
exception of mortgage just because of lower spread and volumes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
So, John, the simplest way to think about it is the 2% sort of assumes a flattish kind of NII and the upside of it, the
2% to 4% is in the NII and the balance of the growth is noninterest income.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Thanks, Bill, it's helpful, and Daryl, thanks for that. And separately on the loan growth side, I want to see if
you could give just expectations how we should think about the pace of growth in 2022 and maybe also for that as
well how that would break down in terms of commercial versus consumer trends? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. John, maybe I'll do a little sort of where we are and what the jumping-off point is to put a little context
around that. As you well know loan growth is a function of production, utilization, paydowns and pipelines, is the
way that I would like to think about the formula in its most simple way. And as we finished the fourth quarter, we
really saw the production start to increase, utilization was up about 2.5 points which was – that's the first time
we'd seen a swing in the utilization front and that was pretty universal. So, we felt good about that from a
momentum standpoint. Paydowns were up a little bit but maybe most importantly is the pipelines were at really,
really high levels. So, our CCB pipeline, our CIB pipeline and our CRE pipeline, all were at historically sort of high
levels compared to the quarter and compared to this time last year. Usually, this time of the year we're starting to
clean out pipelines and sort of trying to refresh in the first quarter. So, we entered this with a little more confidence
and momentum than maybe we have in the past.
On the consumer side, we have some headwinds from student loan but that was really just less purchases
available. So, I mean, I think that's sort of a little bit of a conscious kind of decision and then home equity which I
think just is a symbol of sort of how people want to borrow in the future. But remember things like Service Finance
are coming on. We completed that purchase in early December, so we will sort of get the benefit of that on the
consumer side as we come through.
So, in terms of thinking about the whole year and thinking about the puts and takes, I think sort of a mid-single
digit from here kind of growth rate based upon everything we know now, nothing else changing so on and so
forth, I think is sort of eminently achievable and I think reflective of the momentum we have right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Oh, thanks, good morning, guys. Hey, just wanted to come back on that expense trajectory and how you kind of
take us from here to there. I heard the points about the 1% to 2% underlying growth off the end of the year. You
also said you're on track to get the full cost-saves. Can you kind of talk us through after the conversion, when do
you get to that, that run rate numbers, still the fourth quarter, and any update that you might have in terms of just
that gross versus net and if you're doing any better on the either side versus your original expectations? Thanks.

Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So Ken, as I've said before our trajectory on expenses is not just down every quarter, it moves up and
down, obviously, we got some seasonal factors going from fourth to first with FICA and 401(k). And then we are
building our marketing budget and basically rolling out our Truist brand across the whole footprint pretty
aggressively to build brand awareness.
I think as the quarter and years play out. I think you're going to see expenses maybe pick up a little bit and then
as we get through all the technology decommissioning that's probably the biggest cost-saves to still come
through. That's really backend loaded right now. We still have 400 branches that will go away early in the quarter.
But for the most part other real estate and technology savings are probably the biggest savings which will be
towards the end of the quarter and we feel really good about still hitting our target that we originally set when we
announced the merger.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. And one other point I'd add, I think Daryl was making this earlier. This also covers the investments that
we're making, so we have this unique opportunity and that we've got cost-saves ahead of us, but ability to cover
not only the inflation pressures, but also our investments in talent, our investment in technology, the ability to grow
our businesses, that's all factored into this guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. If you look at the investments we're making this quarter versus last year, it's probably double what it was.
So we're actually investing more in the company and still achieving our cost-saves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Understood, thanks. And just a second question. You talked about insurance being better this year, the January 1
renewals were 10%, 11%. I'm just wondering if you could you help us understand what the growth outlook is for
the insurance business given you have – the mid-year acquisitions you had in addition to the organic growth
outlook? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ken if it's okay, I'll let John sort of hit that directly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Howard A
Chief Insurance Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Bill. I'd say that the environment for insurance continues to be favorable. So when you think about it from
a pricing standpoint you mentioned the January 1 renewals, those were largely around reinsurance pricing and
they vary by class of business, but it remains a favorable environment for insurance pricing. We continue to see
exposure growth. We continue to see very strong statistics in new business and retention. So we expect strong
performance in insurance in 2022.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can you now share with us – obviously your CET1 ratio, you lowered the near-term targeted ratio to 9.75% from
10%, what is the longer term once the deal – the integration is completed, or in 2023 heading out further, what do
you guys think is long-term CET1 ratio for you folks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Gerard, I think as we've said before, I mean, we're going to continue to look at sort of where we are in our merger
integration, where the economy is, the health of our business and make those adjustments on an ongoing basis.
And this won't be a quarterly kind of thing, but just as we see significant shifts in those criteria evidenced by the
fact we went from 10% to 9.75%. And also the fact that we've got flexibility, I mean the good news for us, we had
loan growth at the end of the quarter that probably exceeded our expectations and that took our CET1 a little
below that target, which we think is great by the way, that's sort of a high-class way to go below that target.
So as we go through the process this year, we go through to the CCAR process, look at all the stress testing
results, I think sometimes toward the middle or the end part of this year, we'll take another harder look and be
more communicative about where another goal might be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, I'm trying to figure out on the fourth quarter call for 2022 next
January, what's going to be the real subject of discussions for you folks and maybe your peers. Obviously, we're
not going to be talking about restructuring costs and things like that because it will be finally over for you folks. But
credit is something that I'm wondering about because it's so good today, we all know that and I don't know if
Clarke can comment on this. But I'm curious, when you look at your underwriting standards today, I don't know if
you want to use a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being very conservative, 1 being very aggressive, where does it stand
versus where it was at the start of the pandemic and then where it was versus 2019. And then second, what's
going on with your competition? Are they being really aggressive – you guys seeing really aggressive
underwriting from some of your peers? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes III A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, Gerard, that's great question. I would say for Truist we've removed all our COVID-related overlays that we
added in from our underwriting standpoint as the pandemic hit. So I would say we're underwriting more or less at
a normal through the cycle rate. So right in the middle of the field, we're not on the aggressive end, we're not on
the conservative end, I think we're leading the market through our long-term approach.

Obviously, it's very competitive out there. There are aggressive structures and pricing considerations that we have
to deal with every day, but I think our view is that because of our diverse business model and then particularly in
our lending segments, we can get responsible growth by – through the cycle approach. So I would say for us,
we're in a pretty normal approach, albeit watching those areas that might have been impacted structurally by the
pandemic, CRE office, things like that. But otherwise for us it's more normal underwriting.

Operator: Mike Mayo, with Wells Fargo Securities, has the next question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Good morning, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just a specific question as relates to competition, what's been the retention rate of your employees, customers,
deposits. When the merger was announced three years ago, there was a lot of talk about competitors gaining
share, and I am just wondering what specific metrics you have around that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Sure, Mike, I'll take a crack at that. Obviously, that's extremely high focus area for us. So if we start with deposit
and client-side, I would say it's been exceptional and exceeded our expectations, the branch closures, retention
numbers have been really in the high – high-90s. I think it's just a reflection of clients' confidence in us, our
presence in the market and our ability to handle their needs whether it's digital or whether it's physical. So I think
– so that part has been exceptional – exceeded probably all expectations. And the same thing on the – we see in
the deposit growth. So, I mean, I think we're – those are hard numbers looking at market share, but I feel like
we're taking share in that sense because in that – in that retention model.
As it moves to teammates, I think you and I had talked about this, right into the first year of the merger our
retention numbers were actually higher for Truist than they were compared to each heritage company. So our
teammates had voted for the merger and wanting to be part of that. And we look at not only overall retention, we
look at high performer retention. Retention, we divide it up a lot of different ways. Obviously that attrition has
picked up and that's picked up across the industry. I still think on a relative basis we look really strong from that
standpoint.
And if you think about what's going to happen to us. We also changed the denominator a bit when we closed a lot
of branches and we're still consolidating. So our ability, I think, to stay ahead of the attrition game, I think we're
really, really well positioned from that standpoint.

But also and may be equally importantly is our attractiveness to hire talent has never been better. I mean, we are
bringing in some fantastic people that want to be part of our company, they bought into our purpose, they love the
idea of being on a strong legacy company that feels like a start-up, so it's got sort of a nice combination to it. Our
commitment and capacity to innovate, make investments has been really attractive.
So, our retention numbers – I mean, our attrition numbers are up, there is no doubt about that in the last year,
everybody else is. I think on a relative basis, we're okay, we manage it to an absolute though, that's the way I
think about it. And our ability to attract talent's really, really strong – never been stronger.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
All right. And as far as the follow-up, I'm going to have a wind-up to my second question here. It's been almost
three years since you announced the merger. Your stock's up 39%, the bank index is up 52%, the S&P is up 71%.
So you have woefully underperformed from the stock standpoint, and that coincides with a period when you've
shown some negative operating leverage especially last year. And you've talked about this, the pandemic slowed
down the merger conversions, NII has been depressed, you've had a cautious approach, you wanted best of
breed, and so we have all that.
So, really, getting to positive operating leverage this year, you're doubling the investment, but I just want to know
if we can have additional reassurance that operating leverage will be more positive than say 1 basis point,
because you say 2% to 4% revenue growth, 1% to 2% expense growth, so that could be anywhere from 1 basis
point to 300 basis points. And this merger was predicated on overlapping footprints, benefits of technology that
seems like you're spending a lot of the savings and that investors aren't seeing that to the bottom line. So can you
just give any assurance, or maybe not, as far as the positive operating leverage this year and the payback from
these investments while, as you say, the hood is open?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I think the commitment to positive operating leverage is clear in our guidance. Related to how
much we achieve, I think given we've had a pretty conservative forecast on the rate increases, if we get additional
rate increases this was predicated, the 1% in your lineup was predicated on two rate increases, if we get more,
those sort of follow straight through to the bottom line, so we create more operating leverage.
But also I think, to your point and the point I made earlier, we're continuing to invest in this business. I mean we're
not going to achieve operating leverage – positive operating leverage and starve our business. I mean, the ability
to achieve the cost-saves, redeploy them into the appropriate investments from a long term, that was the vision of
Truist. I mean that was the premise upon which we established this merger.
And I think arguably and I – hard to dispute, it's taken a little bit longer. Some of those were decisions we made,
the best of both was a little more expensive than we had anticipated at the outset. But I think you're really starting
to see, and I can feel – you can feel it in the pivot in the fourth quarter, you can feel it in the pivot in our guidance,
the promise of Truist is manifesting itself in not only positive operating leverage but purposeful growth and ability
to invest in the business for the long term. Yes, we're committed to positive operating leverage, underlined,
exclamation point and all the other comments, but in a way that we're continuing to invest to grow our business for
the long term.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, Mike, the only thing else I would add to that, if you look at our net interest income, just to remind you, we
have runoff of purchase accounting accretion about $400 million planned for year-over-year and we have about
$325 million runoff [indiscernible] (00:52:42) planned to be lower year over year.
So for us just to be flat [ph] and (00:52:49) NII is 6.5%, the guidance that we gave for our revenue growth
[indiscernible] (00:52:54) net interest income being up maybe a little bit, maybe 1% on a GAAP basis but that's
really 8%, if you look at the real true operations of the company and, potentially, up to maybe 10% if we get rate
increases and maybe some more loan growth. So the company is really performing at high levels from a
production basis on the amount of volume that we're putting through on the asset side of the equation.

Operator: We'll now hear from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi, good morning. Bill, wanted to ask you little bit more of a industry question. With the loan demand and loan
growth numbers looking better across the industry, what's happening in the psychology of the borrower here, feels
like there is still a liquidity out there but there is a change going on. Is it more confidence about the economy, folks
just have – run into a need to build inventories, why are we seeing this increase in loan demand across the
industry?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think it's a combination of things, John. I mean when I'm out visiting with clients, demand is never the
issue for business. I mean they all have demand and that cuts across actually a wide swath of industries and
geographic locations, so the ability to do business. I think you're seeing a couple things. One is I think what your
premise was in your question, people building a little inventory, sort of anticipating, trying to get ahead some of
the supply chain, I think you see that. Then you just see stuff happening, like in the dealer side, cars are showing
up [ph] on lots (00:54:42), they may be showing up [ph] on lots (00:54:43) needing a chip or whatever it may be,
but they're showing up, so the ability to borrow against those capacities.
And then I think people are just making the decisions to move forward, deploying capital, they've had plans, if
they've delayed plans, they're continuing to look at the current Omicron as potentially a short-term situation that
reverses itself and they don't want to get behind. They're all in competitive situations, so I think they are deploying
capital against the opportunities that they've had planned for the several years. So I think it's a combination of lot
of things. It is just resiliency of the economy and a little bit of positioning to get one step ahead of both supply
chains, wage pressure, whatever it may be and the competition.

Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up for Daryl on the revenue outlook for this year. First, how much of that $300
million impact from the Truist One and overdraft, how much of that gets felt in 2022, Daryl? And then also just on
the overall revenue guide, could you just give us the base for the 2021 revenues, that $22.5 million or something
like that for this year that you are growing 2% to 4% off of. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A

John E. McDonald Q

Okay. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A

It's kind of the base I would grow off of. And then for the Truist One, recall in Bill's remarks, it's probably going to
start in the second quarter and it's probably anywhere from a third to 40% of the impact would be in 2022,
probably spread out evenly over the second, third and fourth quarter and then kind of builds up in 2023 and then
the full run rate in 2024 of $300 million.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess, just wanted to follow up, Bill, on your comments around operating leverage. I think the promise of the
deal partly was the benefit of scale. As we look beyond this year, just structurally when we look at the efficiency
ratio, I think we're about 55%, 56% right now, do you see the bank actually being a low-50s efficiency ratio
franchise over the next two to four years or given the investment spend that you've talked about, it's going to be
hard to make that move absent the meaningfully higher interest rate backdrop.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, it's a good question. And to the latter part of your question, there is some rate dependency – normalization
of rate dependency to get to that lower efficiency ratio. Yeah, we won't make as much move on that in the next
year but our efficiency ratio on a relative basis I think will continue to be industry leading. So I think the ability to
invest in our business, do it in a way that to your point that the scale achieve much more efficient company, I think
we'll be able to continue that progress. And then if we get some sort of normalization of rates, I think looking out
over two- and three-year period I think the low 50s is a reasonable target in a normalized kind of rate
environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
The thing I would add Ebrahim, what I said on Mike's call, the runoff of the purchase accounting accretion gets
easier year after year, so the ability to drive positive operating leverage will get easier as we go out two, three or
four years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess on the revenue side with the systems conversion done, my sense would be given your scale,
given your history in these markets you should be playing offence where you've gained market share. So, Bill, you
shared some retention numbers, but talk to us about your ability to go head to head with regional, smaller banks
and actually gain market share as we think about the next few years and probably outperform on loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Maybe just to clarify the first part of your question, we have been on offence, so I think it's just the ability to
be further on offence and to accentuate that capability. If you look at virtually all of our categories, if you think
about insurance as an example relative to insurance, if you think about our investment banking relative to
investment banking, if you think about deposit growth, loan growth, client acquisition, digital adoption, whatever
measures you want to choose on a relative basis, I mean I feel like we're already gaining share and I think to your
point our capacity to gain share. Our competitiveness, the breadth and depth of our product capability, the talent
that we have on the field, the training that they are receiving, the way they work together in integrated relationship
management, the way that they allow all cylinders of the company to benefit the client, we've just never been
more competitive and against small, against regional, against large, I think all the things that we wanted to see
and feel from Truist are absolutely coming to bear and on the field every day.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'll be quick. Daryl, your outlook for adjusted expense growth, I presume that's
from the $12,687 base and if so, what is the outlook for amortization expense in 2022 please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So the base is correct. What you said was right, Erika. And then if you look in our tables in the back in the
appendix, we actually gave guidance around that out there, so you will be able to easily kind of fill in your models
with all that information, so to make it easy for you.
