I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Ignacio Alvarez.

Ignacio Alvarez
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. In the third quarter, we achieved net income of $155 million, a
decrease of $23 million from the second quarter. These results were primarily driven by a higher provision for
credit losses, which was partly a result of loan growth at BPPR. Credit quality trends remained stable in the
period. Net interest income increased by $4 million compared to the second quarter. While this was below what
we had anticipated, it was largely the result of a $1.8 billion reduction in deposit levels at BPPR, which impacted
the balance and mix of earning assets. That said, average retail customer deposit balances remained
approximately 30% above pre-pandemic levels, and we continue to add new deposit clients during the quarter.
Going forward, we expect to continue to benefit from the repricing of our investment portfolio and loan
originations. We achieved strong loan growth in the quarter with balances increasing by $603 million or nearly
2%. BPR's (sic) [BPPR's] (00:02:20) loan portfolio grew by $583 million, primarily in the commercial segment, but
reflecting growth across almost all lending categories. Popular Bank saw a $21 million increase in loan balances,
driven by commercial loans.
Our net interest margin expanded by 2 basis points to 3.24%, mainly driven by higher average loan balances and
the repricing of loans and reinvestment of securities in a higher interest rate environment. This was partially offset
by higher deposit costs and a lower average balance of investment securities.
Operating expenses decreased by $2 million to $467 million. During the quarter, we repurchased 600,000 of our
shares for approximately $59 million. We continue to believe that our shares are attractive to repurchase at
current prices. Tangible book value per share increased by 10% to $69.04, driven by lower unrealized losses in
our investment portfolio. Please turn to slide 4.
Business activity in Puerto Rico remains solid, as reflected in the favorable trends in total employment, consumer
spending, and other economic data. Consumer spending remained healthy. Combined credit and debit card sales
for BPPR customers increased by approximately 4% compared to the third quarter of 2023.
Our auto loan and lease balances increased by $105 million compared to the second quarter, as demand for new
cars continue to be strong in Puerto Rico. Mortgage loan balances at BPPR increased by $104 million in the third
quarter, driven primarily by home purchase activity and our existing strategy of retaining FHA loans in portfolio.
The tourism and hospitality sector continue to be a source of strength for the local economy. Passenger traffic at
the San Juan International Airport increased by 5% in the third quarter, compared to the third quarter of 2023, and
hotel occupancy continues to be healthy. There is a significant amount of committed federal funds that have yet to
be disbursed. The disbursement of these funds will continue to support economic activities for several years. We
remain optimistic about the future of our primary market and are well-positioned to support our clients during the
coming years.
On that note, I turn the call over to Jorge for more details on our financial results.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
As Ignacio stated, we reported net income of $155 million in the third quarter, $23 million lower than the prior
period's results. Net interest income increased by $4 million. This increase was below what we had expected. The
lower NII was driven primarily by an unanticipated decrease in deposits in Puerto Rico, which impacted the
balance of higher yielding tax-exempt T-bills in our investment portfolio. Ending customer deposit balances at
BPPR, excluding Puerto Rico public deposits, decreased by $856 million in ending balances and by
approximately $1 billion in average balances during the quarter, primarily in low-cost interest-bearing deposit
accounts.
From the beginning of March and through most of the second quarter, retail deposit balances in BPPR benefited
from tax refunds of more than $1.2 billion. During Q3, in addition to continued outflows of deposit balances, driven
by rate-seeking behavior among our commercial and affluent retail deposit customers, we also saw a significant
increase in spending and use of these balances across our retail client base, reversing the increase in average
deposit balances we saw in Q2.
At quarter's end, average retail deposit balances at BPPR are still approximately 30% higher than pre-pandemic
levels, down from a peak of roughly 50% that we saw in Q2 2022.
At the end of the third quarter, Puerto Rico public deposits were $18.7 billion, down $1 billion compared to Q2,
and slightly above the upper end of our year-end guidance range. Average public deposit balances were higher
during the quarter as the bulk of the reduction occurred on the last day of the quarter. Going forward, we expect
public deposits to be in a range of $17 billion to $19 billion.
While we do not anticipate this level of contraction on our deposit balances, the benefits of investment repricing,
stable non-public deposit costs, and loan growth in the quarter contributed to a $4 million increase in net interest
income, despite the reduction in the investment portfolio.
Our net interest margin expanded by 2 basis points on a GAAP basis, driven by loan growth and by the repricing
of loans and securities. NIM on a tax equivalent basis contracted by 1 basis point, primarily resulting from lower
balances of tax-exempt securities and higher levels of disallowed deposit expense. Loan growth was solid,
increasing by $603 million in the quarter, driven by activity at BPPR where we saw increases across nearly all
categories led by commercial, lending, auto, and mortgage originations. Noninterest income was $164 million, a
decrease of $2 million from Q2, driven primarily by lower income from mortgage banking activities as a result of a
decrease in the fair value of MSRs.
We continue to expect noninterest income to be approximately $160 million, $165 million in Q4. We're pleased to
see that credit metrics remained stable during the third quarter. The provision for credit losses of $71 million,
although $25 million higher than the second quarter, increased in part due to loan growth during the quarter in
addition to charge-off activity in the consumer loan portfolio.
Total operating expenses were $467 million or $2 million lower than last quarter, driven by lower professional fees
and reserves for operational losses, offset in part by higher technology costs related to our transformation efforts
and higher personnel expenses due to annual merit increases. We expect total full-year expenses of
approximately $1.91 billion within the range of our original 2024 guidance of $1.89 billion to $1.95 billion.
Our effective tax rate was 22% compared to 19% in the prior quarter, driven by the lower tax-exempt income. We
now expect an effective tax rate for the year of 23% at the top end of our prior guidance range of 21% to 23%.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
Please turn to slide 6. During the quarter, we began to reinvest investment maturities in two to three-year US
Treasury Notes, buying approximately $1.1 billion at an average yield of 3.75%. We expect to continue this
strategy as a way to hedge against lower rates. In BPPR, deposit costs increased by 6 basis points to 1.89%. The
deposit costs at BPPR continued to be impacted by the proportion of public deposits to total deposits.
As discussed last quarter, approximately $800 million of low-cost government-related accounts, managed by our
fiduciary services group, were repriced during the last months of the second quarter to market-linked rates. The
full effect of that adjustment is reflected in our Q3 deposit cost, run rate and margin. At Popular Bank, deposit
costs decreased by 8 basis points during the quarter. This change reflects a reduction in the cost of intercompany
deposits.
The underlying economic activity and demand for credit in Puerto Rico remained strong. In our US markets, we
have begun to see a pickup in the demand for credit. As a result, we now expect consolidated loan growth in the
fourth quarter of approximately 1%. This will result in total loan growth in 2024 of approximately 4% within the
original 3% to 6% guidance range for the year.
We anticipate fourth quarter NII will increase by approximately 1.5% to 2% compared to Q3, driven by continued
reinvestment of securities and loan originations, coupled with the beginning of the repricing of Puerto Rico public
deposits and online deposits at Popular Bank. This will result in a year-over-year growth in 2024 NII of
approximately 6% to 7%, below our previous 8% to 10% guidance.
Additionally, we expect NIM expansion to re-accelerate in Q4 and continue into 2025. Our deposit mix and our
ability to reduce the cost of deposits in the US and the volume and cost of public deposits in Puerto Rico will
continue to present the biggest risk to achieving the expected level of expansion in NIM.
Please turn to slide 7. Regulatory capital levels remained strong. Our CET1 ratio of 16.4% decreased by 6 basis
points from Q2, mainly due to an increase in risk-weighted assets. Tangible book value per share at the end of
the quarter was $69.04, an increase of $6.33 per share from Q2, mostly resulting from the decreased AOCI and
our quarterly net income, offset in part by dividends and stock repurchase activity during the quarter.
During the last two months of the quarter, as part of the previously-announced common stock repurchase
authorization, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares for roughly $59 million or an average price of about
$90 per share. Return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 10%, a reduction from the 11.8% last
quarter, driven by the higher provision expense and higher effective tax rate.
As we look forward to 2025, given a variety of drivers, including the impact of the reduction in deposit balances
experienced this year, the mix shift to higher cost deposits, along with the limited loan growth year-to-date in the
US, we no longer expect to achieve our target of 14% ROTCE by the end of Q4 2025. We now anticipate that we
should be able to generate at least a 12% ROTCE in the fourth quarter of 2025.
Longer term, we, as a management team, continue to be focused on achieving a sustainable 14% return on
tangible common equity. We are confident that our transformation efforts, the repricing of our investment portfolio
and loan demand in all of our markets will be important catalysts to achieve this target over time.
With that, I turn the call over to Lidio.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
Thank you, Jorge, and good morning. Credit quality metrics remained stable through the third quarter. The
corporation's mortgage and commercial portfolios continued to reflect credit metrics significantly below pre-
pandemic levels. Consumer portfolios reflected increased delinquencies and net charge-offs, driven by the auto
loan portfolio.
Delinquencies and net charge-off in this portfolio have gradually increased, but remained slightly below pre-
pandemic levels. We are closely monitoring changes in the macroeconomic environment and on borrower
performance, given higher interest rates and inflationary pressures. We believe that the improvements over recent
years in risk management practices and the risk profile of the corporation loans portfolio positions Popular to
continue to operate successfully under the current environment.
Turning to slide number 8, non-performing assets and non-performing loans increased during the quarter, driven
by Popular Bank. NPLs in Popular Bank increased by $18 million related to high-mortgage NPLs by $17 million,
impacted by single loan that we enter NPL status after becoming current in the second quarter. NPLs in BPPR
increased by $2 million, mainly driven by a $9 million increase in OREO, partially offset by a $6 million reduction
in mortgage and a $2 million reduction in commercial.
OREOs in BPPR decreased by $7 million, driven by sales of residential real estate properties. Interest of NPLs
decreased by $7 million. In BPPR, the decrease was driven by mortgage. In Popular Bank, the $19 million
reduction in commercial was offset in part by the $17 million mortgage loan that we enter NPL status. It is
important to note that this residential property is well-located, has a loan-to-value below 50% and that we have no
additional lending exposure to this client. The ratio of NPLs to total loans held in portfolio remained flat at 1%.
Turning to slide number 9, net charge-offs amounted to $59 million or a annualized 65 basis points of average
loans held in portfolio compared to $54 million or 61 basis points in the prior quarter. Net charge-off in BPPR
increased by $5 million, driven by higher consumer by $9 million, offset in part by lower commercial and
construction by $3 million. In Popular Bank, net charge-off remained flat quarter-over-quarter.
Given the credit performance in the first three quarters of the year and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we
expect net charge-off for the full year at the low end of our initial guidance of 65 basis points to 85 basis points.
Please turn to slide number 10.
The allowance for credit losses increased by $14 million to $744 million. In BPPR, the ACL increased by $23
million, mainly due to a combination of growth in the commercial portfolios and changes in credit quality trends in
the auto and credit cards portfolio. In Popular Bank, the ACL decreased by $8 million, mainly driven by lower
reserves in the commercial and construction portfolios, due to improvements in risk ratings. The corporation ratio
of ACL to loans held in portfolio was 2.06% versus 2.05% in the prior quarter. The ratio of the ACL to NPLs was
206% compared to 214% in the previous quarter.
The provision for credit losses was $73 million compared to $44 million in the prior quarter, reflecting higher
balances, higher losses, and changes in credit quality. In BPPR, the provision was $77 million compared to $49
million. While in Popular Bank, the provision was a benefit of $4 million similar to the prior quarter.
To summarize, credit quality metrics remained stable during the third quarter. We are attentive to the evolving
environment, but remain encouraged by the performance of our loan book.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks. Thank you.

Ignacio Alvarez
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Lidio and Jorge, for your updates. While the increase in revenues was lower than we anticipated, the
underlying drivers of our business continue to be favorable, as demonstrated by the progression of net interest
income and margin, loan growth, and stable credit trends. We are making headway in our business
transformation with meaningful progress in modernizing our customer channels and improving the customer
experience. We have streamlined the process of rolling out updates to our various customer-facing applications.
For example, our consumer digital banking application in Puerto Rico has improved the time to production of
releases by 30% over the past two years.
Additionally, we are increasing the personalization of our offering to provide customers the right solution at the
right time and to the right channel to deepen our relationships with them. I am optimistic about our prospects for
the remainder of the year and beyond. Business trends in Puerto Rico continue to be positive, and we are well-
positioned to participate in the economic activity that is expected to be generated in the coming years. We are
now ready to answer your questions.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. Wanted to start with the deposit trends on the retail side that you discussed in your
prepared commentary. Was there – just a – maybe not an all of a sudden move, but was there just a concerted
move this quarter with maybe some activity? Can you talk a little bit more about what happened with how high-
net-worth retail and clients were moving deposits, etcetera, and just trying to get a sense of where you think that
might go from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Sure, Brett. So, when we look back last seven or eight quarters, what we have seen is a pretty consistent trend
focused on our high net worth and corporate clients looking for yield enhancement. We've seen a lot of movement
into our Popular security subsidiary. It's pretty normal. This is consistent with what we have seen in the US as
restrictive monetary policy, people will move.
What was new during this quarter, and we have said, [ph] city (00:20:18) money wakes up. We did see a little bit
of an acceleration of more money moving out and into those higher yielding assets. But what surprised us was the
level of expenditure across our retail network. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the – from the period of
March through June, our retail clients received roughly $1.2 billion in refunds from their tax refunds in Puerto Rico.
That was about $200 million more than last year. Traditionally, that money stays longer and it circulates within our
client base and structure. We did not see that. There's nothing to pinpoint. I think there – when we look at the
market, there's nothing to pinpoint of deposit moving within the banking system. It's really moving out.
Expenditures, we have seen an increase in our debit card purchases, increases in the payment levels on credit
cards. It's just the aggregate impact of everything.

As we look through – as I mentioned, we have – our average balance are about 30% higher than pre-pandemic
levels. We certainly would not expect at this stage people to go back to those levels. Obviously, a passage of
time, people are making more money in Puerto Rico, et cetera. But we've tried to kind of size what do we think is
at risk. It's very hard when you're talking about the broad-based retail network, talking – we're 1.7 million clients.
You're talking about people's psychology, what they're doing. These are a little bit unprecedented times in terms
of the amount of stimulus that Puerto Ricans have received through the pandemic and beyond. But we do believe
– our best estimate right now is that maybe there is still risk of somewhere in the $600 million to $800 million in
our deposit base. But in terms of timing or ability, we are not sure, but we are very focused on this.
The one other thing I would say, I mean, obviously, the NII, we talked about NII being a catalyst of our growth,
both in terms of achieving our goals for this year and for next year. That hasn't changed. I mean, in terms of the
dynamic, the repricing of the investment portfolio continues. Loan origination and the repricing of our portfolio also
continues.
When we look at – we're not ready to give you guidance for 2025. We will do that in more detail in January on our
call. But I think at this stage, we would expect that at least in 2025, we would see that same level of growth of 7%
or so that we are seeing this year in 2024. But we'll give you more information in January when we are – have a
little more visibility, and we see how the fourth quarter trends and our clients behave.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. That's really helpful. And then wanted to dive a little further into the expense growth guidance, specifically
for the fourth quarter with the full year at $1.91 billion, which would intimate about $45 million of growth in the
fourth quarter. Can you guys maybe talk about that? Is there some consulting going on into the end of the year?
And I know you're probably not ready to give guidance for 2025, but any early thoughts on how the fourth quarter
levels might matriculate into next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah, Brett. We need to make sure that when we give the guidance of the $1.91 billion, it's on a GAAP
basis. So, I just want to make sure that you're looking at...

quarter. I think those two are – they combine to maybe like $22 million, $23 million. So, I think...

...is probably closer to $5 million to $30 million range rather than the $45 million that you mentioned. It's still an
increase. Yes, it is related in part to the efforts of transformation, professional fees, consulting-related expenses,
as well as seasonal expenses that occur every year towards the end of the year, local holiday spending,
promotions, donations, and different things that if you look at our historical, the fourth quarter always tends to
have an uptick in expenses. Of course, we're conscious of controlling costs, particularly given the NII mix this

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning. Just wondering if you can, Jorge, maybe talk a little bit about the ability to reprice deposits here.
What you're seeing so far given the 50-basis-point cut in September. I'd imagine maybe, just given some of the
numbers you talk about, it's potentially being at risk on the deposit side, maybe makes it a little bit more difficult to
reduce costs. Just why don't you give us an update on thoughts of deposit betas really here, I guess, in the near
term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Sure. So, we like to think of that in different buckets. Let's first talk about the public deposits in Puerto Rico. Those
– as you know, our market linked to short-term indexes. We don't disclose the indexes, but they're short-term
indexes and it's not tied to Fed funds. We're already seeing the benefits of that. Those are priced with a lag. But
some of the short term index are maybe moving ahead of projected or expected movement by the Fed. So, we're
already seeing the benefit of that in the fourth quarter on the public deposits and we would expect that to
continue.
The second group is the retail and commercial network in Puerto Rico. As you know, we've had very low betas on
the way up in Puerto Rico. We don't expect to see a lot of opportunities to move down, particularly in the early
stages of movements, so that we don't – we would expect that to have very low betas on the way down.
And then, you have the US deposits. There, both the direct online channel as well as the branch network, we
have had high betas in both of those channels. We would expect – and we have already begun to see reductions
in both of those deposit sources. But those are a little bit more subject to market competitive dynamics. For
example, I think in the online channel, we were able to bring down our savings accounts, I think, 30 basis points
versus the Fed move 50 basis points. We have seen competitors in the space actually increase rates in the last
couple of weeks.
So, right now, we're pricing to maintain deposits. We're not pricing to grow. There is opportunity there and we'll be
very focused. That's an area of opportunity for us. But given the competitive stand of the US franchise, any
changes in liquidity in the marketplace or pricing by bigger banks or competitors could have an impact. But over
time, there is an opportunity there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then, just in terms of the updated – the 12% ROTCE, I think you mentioned you're targeting now by the
fourth quarter – or in the fourth quarter 2025. Does that continue to not benefit from an AOCI loss? That continue
to exclude AOCI, that ROTCE target?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
That is correct. That is the same calculation.

Okay. And any thoughts on – in terms of – as you – obviously, the NII – reduction in NII expectations set you back
a little bit in terms of getting to a higher return on tangible common equity. But any sort of updated thought on that
14% bogey in terms of timing or too early to say?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
It's early to say. I mean, I would say that, number one, as a management team, we're still focused on that 14%.
The dynamics of Popular haven't changed in just one quarter. We still believe that the transformation efforts and
management's focus towards a determined target, albeit, aspirational is still there and important for us. I think it
will take us longer. We're going to have to work a lot harder to get there, but we are focused on that.
In terms of the 12% ROTCE, I think the simplest way I can describe it, I look at the second quarter results and the
third quarter results, we took a step back in those ROTCEs. We're coming from a lower base. We want to get
back to that growth and that level that we had anticipated before and work hard towards achieving that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And if I could just sneak in one last one, just on – in the past, I think you guys have done sort of the accelerated
buyback route. And so, kind of harder to get a sense. But could you – is there any – would you say there's any
seasonality to buyback activity here? Just trying to get a sense of what the quarterly run rate could look like going
forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
So, one thing I'll make sure listeners know, we started the third quarter's buyback in August. We really were in the
market for two months out of the quarter. We hope that, over time, you'll get to see a cadence of our activity. We,
obviously, haven't given a timeframe on that authorization, but we intend to use it, but maintain the flexibility. Like
our peers, we see peers change in terms of when they're in and out of the market. We just want to maintain that
flexibility. But at the end, we didn't put an authorization just as a benchmark for you, but for us to execute upon
that.
NII growth will still continue to be the driver to improve ROTCE, but as – obviously now that we have an
authorization, it should contribute to improving that return from where we're at today.

Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe just a housekeeping item on expenses. I appreciate that
you're guiding on a GAAP basis. Just want to clarify, does that include any OREO gains and losses in there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. That's part of our expense base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And loan growth was really, really strong this quarter, kind of as you look ahead, I'm interested in – I
appreciate 4% for the year. As you look ahead, wondering where you're seeing good opportunities, how you're
seeing demand on the island for loans and if you expect an acceleration in that with the rates coming down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
This is Ignacio. I mean, really, the demand in Puerto Rico, as you said, has been very strong and we've been able
to close a number of loans. I don't know if I would use the word accelerate, but I think it's going to continue to be
strong. We – the pipeline looks good. Some of the loans are bulky. So, it depends when we close them and what
payoffs we have. But we're seeing good demand across the board, especially in commercial.
We're seeing a lot of interest in investment in Puerto Rico as we continue to trade. We're seeing people coming to
the island. So, we're very confident. I mean, almost across all sectors are we seeing strong loan growth,
especially in the commercial area.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
And one thing I would add, Kelly, is, I mean, that's Puerto Rico. In the US this year, we've had no – we went
backwards, right? In the first two quarters, we went down. This quarter, we grew about $20 million. We are seeing
a pickup in demand, credit demand in the US, in – particularly in construction and in community association
lending, in Florida in particular. I think that's an area where we might be able to see more acceleration, certainly
from the level this year. Part of that slow loan growth, it's what's affected our projection for next year and the
change in the ROTCE guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I mean, the things in Puerto Rico continue to really – steady growth. I mean, numbers just came out for
unemployment in September and the unemployment rate went down again from 5.7% to 5.5%. And we added
private sector jobs of 16,000 in the month. So that gives you sort of a benchmark of economic activity on the
island.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. Maybe last one for me. I think in your prepared remarks, liquidity on the island remains high.
You did have now two quarters of [ph] NIBs (00:34:49), outflows. I'm wondering, is there any way that you're
approaching the deposit base in terms of [ph] NIBs (00:34:58) that could continue to be at risk? And how does
that factor into your revised kind of NII profitability outlook from here?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. So, what I mentioned before is that looking at the average balances being around 30% higher than pre-
pandemic and seeing the behavior that we saw in this last quarter in particular with our retail clients, hard to
predict. We think that our best guess right now it's you still have $600 million to $800 million at – possibly at risk
from that base. And I don't – in terms of timeline or anything, we don't have that. And we certainly would expect
that in the second quarter next year, we'll see the same cyclicality of tax refunds coming in at the same level.
There's no reason to expect that they will be significantly different or lower. It's just whether the client behavior
changes.
We're not seeing people – certainly the affluent and corporate clients, commercial clients, have been consistent
over the last seven or eight quarters in improving and enhancing their excess liquidity, using it for working capital
or simply going for higher yield. We're not seeing necessarily a lot of clients in the mass affluent group moving to
other banks or be competitive in terms of yield and cost. So, it's really a matter of balancing client behavior with
our offerings of deposit service and being strategic with our larger relationships to make sure that we retain those
deposits.

Jorge J. García A

Yeah. Jared, I mean, I think the NII continues to be the driver of increased profitability. That doesn't change with
the change in the target. I would – again, we have a – the authorization is out. We're executing upon that. We
know that that's a lever, certainly. But we want to make sure that what we're doing is sustainable and NII will
continue to be the big driver. We haven't given that target number. We'll have to think about it and see if it helps in
the future. But NII continues to be the driver.

Jared Shaw Q

Okay. Okay. And then just shifting to credit, you look at charge-off levels. They've been better than that longer
term normalized range, call it, 75 basis points to 125 basis points. Is this a new good long-term level? Or is there
a reason to think we should be – we should expect to see credit costs and charge-offs migrate back up higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I will say certainly that in the short term, that will not be the case. I mean, we still see strong performance
by our commercial and mortgage portfolios with – actually, in the mortgage portfolio, we're seeing negative
charge-offs or benefits. So, I mean, I think in the short to medium term, probably not; in the long term, we'll see.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Just going back to the NII guidance, tax equivalent NII declined in 3Q, the guide for fourth
quarter. Is that on a tax equivalent basis? Or is there going to be continued movement between the adjustment in
tax equivalent and the tax rate there that might change the tax equivalent expectation versus the GAAP NII
expectations?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
No. The guidance is GAAP – is based on GAAP. But one of the drivers – obviously, we had lower tax-exempt
income because of the lower earning assets, Timur. But with the increase in the deposit costs in Puerto Rico, that
just essentially makes your tax-exempt portfolio less efficient. That's why you had kind of this weird relationship
between an expansion in the GAAP – in the NIM GAAP versus the tax-affected GAAP.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. I mean, could we extrapolate that same level of increase in the tax equivalent NII for next quarter or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
I don't think of it that way. So, I'll be giving an answer without really having looked at it. What I would say is that,
we are anticipating the NIM to expand. I would expect that both the GAAP NIM and the tax-effective – tax-affected
NIM to expand as well.

Okay. Thanks for that. And then just, again, on the deposits, any line of sight for public fund outflows in 4Q? I
guess the decline that happened in 3Q, was there anything that maybe got pulled forward? And I guess to what
extent do you need a stable deposit base in the fourth quarter in order to achieve that fourth quarter NII guide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Well, let me first say, we don't have a large – our guidance right now for the end of the year, we gave $17 billion
to $19 billion. We're not anticipating anything large in the fourth quarter. We had anticipated the Q3 payoff. That
was part of our – we had visibility in that and why we had not increased the range in – when we announced in the
second quarter. In the first quarter, the government does have some GO payments and other disbursements that
may impact the first quarter. But right now, we're not expecting anything large.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just last for me, trying to extrapolate consumer credit trends with the fact that consumers are
starting to utilize more their liquidity. How closely correlated are those two? We've seen kind of consumer trough
earlier in the year now starting to take a little higher in those delinquencies as some of that liquidity is being rolled
off. Can you maybe provide us an update on where you see consumer credit peaking out here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
Well, I mean, the way we look at the consumer outlook for it, I mean, we have a very strong market, a very strong
unemployment market with, as Ignacio mentioned, unemployment, a record low 5.5%. We also have a –
consumers still have a lot of liquidity, 30% above the liquidity that they have prior to the pandemic. So, we are
generally positive about the outlook for the consumer on a going-forward basis. And also, with rates coming
down, I think that is also going to also be helpful for some of the outstanding debt that they may have, particularly
in credit cards.

I just wanted to clarify. In the prepared remarks, you said, if I caught it correctly, of at least 12%? Or should we
kind of earmark it for 12%? I know it's a bit of a modeling and backing into it. I'm just trying to make sure that
we're not expecting too low of expectations here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.

At least, okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A

It's the target.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got it. Okay. The cushion the blow a little bit here. But when you think about credit, I know we just touched on it
here with the last question, but I know in 2Q, you made initiatives kind of calling people within the consumer book
a little bit faster, doing things behind the scenes. That's clearly showed improvement on 2Q. 3Q, you seem to
show a little slippage, and it's not like you guys are the only one. The other banks in Puerto Rico seem to have a
similar component.
But when you go forward here, is there any color you can provide on kind of marrying the two of, like you just
said, unemployment is lower, wages are up? We're still seeing a little bit of slippage. Is it legacy FICO kind of
working its way through the pipeline here or – just any thoughts on credit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
I think – I mean, I think you did touch upon some of the things. We did see that deterioration in the second half of
last year, and we reacted by changing underwriting, collection efforts, et cetera. Some of that, as you said, it's the
[indiscernible] (00:44:55) on it. It will take some time to get through and clear up.
It's important that the US is also seeing strong unemployment numbers, strong consumer, and they are seeing
consumer losses as well. So, it's not unique to us. We're still well below pre-pandemic levels in some of our
portfolios, particularly around delinquencies. I think where you see some of the noise in Puerto Rico, we do have
some purchased portfolios that we bought from fintechs in 2022 – 2021 and 2022. Those have higher losses than
the Puerto Rico numbers. So, that skews the number a little bit.
If you want to get a sense, you can look at the losses in the consumer loan portfolio, NPV, and those losses are
very similar. And you can kind of get a sense. I think there's about $100 million in that portfolio. So, that impacts
those number. And then, the other is the auto loans. They do tend to be a little bit more lumpy, because you do
have to do the recovery of those delinquent autos and repossess them and that can be lumpy in the numbers for
charge-offs.
I don't know, Lidio...

Two things maybe to add to that. I would say, first, when we're looking at things on a vintage basis, we see very
strong performance by the recent vintages. So, that is very encouraging from a going-forward basis. We also see
the trends in early delinquency, also very positive. So, notwithstanding the current performance, we think, as we
look into the future, things are heading in the right direction.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
No. I mean, I think the transformation effort will be ongoing. As we've said, we look at early on a slowdown in
expense increases, not necessarily a recovery or reduction of expenses. But what we see, it's a lot of shifts, right?
So, maybe, today, we're spending money in consultant and doing work while we're capitalizing software
development. Next year, you might see reductions in consultants and then you pick up on depreciation,
amortization of software, capitalized software. So, it's a trend that kind of bounces out, but the transformation
effort is going to take some time. It doesn't end in 2025.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
Jorge, can you share with us? I think when I looked at your 2Q 10-Q, you guys, in your asset sensitivity table,
indicated that you were asset-sensitive that a rise in rates would positively affect net interest income. And I
noticed this quarter, the investment portfolio duration extended out a little bit from the second quarter. Are you
currently asset-sensitive still today?
And then, the second part of the question is, and I'm not asking for 2025 guidance, but if the forward interest rate
curve is correct and we see the short end of the curve coming down, possibly the 3.5% by the end of next year,
would that be an added headwind for net interest income growth for you guys?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
So, first, Gerard, I want to say, I mean, we are fairly neutral in our interest rate position, right? We measure that
on a 12-month period. So, I want to make sure that we highlight that.
In terms of the quarter, we did start – during this quarter, we bought about $1.1 billion in two to three-year
Treasury Notes, both in Puerto Rico and in the US bank, to try to mitigate any – or hedge against rates coming
down. So, we're trying to become a little bit more liability-sensitive. We expect to continue that, not necessarily
adding more to it. But as new notes mature, reinvesting them in that two to three-year period, trying to maintain
similar level of duration for the entire portfolio. And over time, that will help mitigate.
Certainly, we all would like to see a normal sloping curve, that was very helpful to us, and a higher-for-longer
environment with the loan growth that we're seeing in Puerto Rico and certainly helps if you eventually get to –
reduce your funding costs. But given our position and the repricing of those – that investment portfolio that today
is underwater against the cost of public funds, we see that, we still have a lot of tailwinds – positive tailwinds
through the next few quarters, I think through 2026, for repricing and getting a lift from where we're at today to
where those should reprice.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Thank you. And then, just to follow up on the credit conversation we've been having on this call, the
credit card portfolio, slide 24, you give us very good detail on what's going on with delinquencies and charge-offs.
I'm curious, it seems odd that when I look at your FICO mix of originations, they steadily have increased from the
pre-COVID period to where we are today. But you point out in this slide that your delinquency levels as well as
your charge-offs as a percentage of the portfolio, have risen above pre-COVID levels. What's accounting for the
disconnect of a higher FICO score, but now you're seeing higher charge-off and delinquency levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
In regards of credit cards, originations don't necessarily equate with outstanding balances, because it takes time –
so, it takes a little bit of time for it to build up. So, the [ph] originations (00:51:29) that you see in the slide might
coincide with a very small percentage of our total balance. So, that explains why, notwithstanding the fact that
you've seen significant improvement in FICO, you don't – you are not seeing the same level of improvement in
delinquency and charge-offs.

Gerard, I would also add, I mean, certainly, when we look at pre-pandemic, I mean, the current rate environment
is fairly high, right? So, I think those have some impact, too. And hopefully, this is one portfolio that, as rates start
coming down, the borrowers should see some very quick relief in terms of the level of payments, et cetera.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the public deposits for a minute. Given some of the short-term rate
moves, for example, like the one-year treasury over the last few weeks, is there argument to be made that there's
going to be some headwind to repricing them down in 4Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
There's – I mean, there's always basis risk internally. When we talk about being neutral, we talk about being
neutral over a 12-month period. But bottom line, that means that our assets – I mean, we have still a number of
assets and liabilities that we price, right? There is a difference in basis. So, there's always that risk. The risk is not
always negative, right? The rates can get ahead of Fed movements and benefit. And we have assets that may be
repricing based on prime versus liabilities, pricing based on different indexes. So that could create some noise.
So, I'm always hesitant to say that it's a headwind. There is a timing difference. I mean, these are our price on a
lag, so that you always have that risk. The full effect will take longer. But we've also tried to stagger some of our
T-bills to account for some of these things. And when we try to manage to that, I think the issue and the hesitation
is that it is a $18 billion, $19 billion portfolio. So, 5 basis points, 10 basis points does make a difference there.

Yes. Yes. Thank you for that. And then just wanted to go back to – you talked through the different deposit
channels and through the repricing opportunities. It sounds like you're happy to pay the rates to keep the
deposits, sort of the non-public deposits at least flat. Is that the right way to read it? Or could we see you get sort
of aggressive enough to drive some deposit growth in the non-public part of the base?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
This is Ignacio. I think we only get aggressive if we thought we were losing deposits to price competition. And I
don't think that's the case. I mean, there is some price competition from the US treasuries, but we can't raise
deposit rates enough to compete with that. And in terms of regular deposits from our commercial, like,
competitors, we're not seeing that. So, we're just seeing people either moving money to these other alternative
investments or spending the money. So, we don't think at this point it would be productive to raise rates.
Now, we'll be like – Jorge mentioned earlier in the call, we don't think we're going to be able to lower rates much
either because they're starting from a low point.
