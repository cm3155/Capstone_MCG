Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
Edward Joseph Wehmer
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thank you very much. Welcome everybody to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. With me as always are Dave
Dykstra; Dave Stoehr; Kate Boege, who is remote, so I don't have to shock collar on, so I'm in great shape for
today; Tim Crane; and Rich Murphy. We [indiscernible] (00:01:54) go with the same format as we always do. I'm
going to use some general comments regarding our results, turn over to Tim for more detail on the balance sheet.
Dave Dykstra will follow some details on income statement and Rich Murphy will comment on credit. And then
back to me for some summary comments and thoughts about the future and some questions after that.
All in all, was a very good quarter and went pretty much according to plan. Asset growth may seem muted
compared to prior quarters. Last year we had approximately $1 billion per quarter and $2 billion in the fourth
quarter. We noted probably half of the $2 billion of growth was going to be transitory, not like inflation, but really
transitory. It's related to the few big customers who experienced large liquidity events the end of the year. Does
turn out to be the case. So it appears we are back on $1 billion growth level per quarter as we're up just little over
$100 million in total assets.
Net interest income and the margin, both improved as expected, 10 basis points of the margin sans PPP and $3
million net interest income despite two fewer days in the quarter [indiscernible] (00:03:02) approximately $3
million, plus or minus. The core deposit increase occurred late in the quarter. So we expect to see further benefits
moving forward. This core deposit increase should provide up to $50 million net interest income on an annualized
basis, but we're all positioned for future rate increases.
Loans grew at the upper end of our guidance at around 9%. So was very diversified. Pipeline has remained
extremely strong. Keep saying credit can't get any better, but it does. NPAs and NPLs remained extremely low.
NPA – NPLs fell $17 million, $57.3 million or 0.12% of total loans. NPAs decreased $15 million to $63.5 million or
0.13%, total assets. These are incredible numbers for a $50 billion bank. [indiscernible] (00:03:53) say so myself,
how to get much better, but we will continue to try.
Tim will discuss other income in detail. I want to make one comment [indiscernible] (00:04:02) valuation increases
or decreases, they're very important part of our planning. Increases seen this quarter basically offset the OCI
effect. Higher rate on our tangible book value worked according to plan. Wealth management fees continued to
grow. Our expenses were – our expense growth was pretty much benign. [indiscernible] (00:04:21) I can repeat
everything, but $127.4 million, 29% over the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $2.07. Pre-tax, pre-
provision of [indiscernible] (00:04:37), anyhow – I'm sorry, $177,786 pre-tax, pre-provision. Pre-provision $130
million. [indiscernible] (00:04:49) pre-provision and margin at 2.61%. We feel pretty good about where we are
right now.
And with that, I'm going to turn over to Tim, who is going to cover additional detail on the balance sheet. Go
ahead, Tim.

Timothy S. Crane
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Great. Thanks, Ed. In addition to the $800 million and the 9% loan growth, important to note that period end loan
balances excluding PPP were over $500 million, ahead of the quarter average, which should help our second
quarter results. PPP loans continue to run down as they are forgiven and at roughly $250 million at quarter end.
They're no longer material and will largely be gone by mid-year. Going forward, while encouraged by growing
pipelines, we believe that loan growth in the mid to high single digits on an annualized basis remains a

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
reasonable expectation given the uncertainties surrounding the macroeconomic outlook. Ed mentioned deposit
growth of approximately $125 million for the quarter. This was influenced by a handful of very large client outflows
related in most cases to funds that came to us in the fourth quarter and then left in the first quarter, essentially in
and out transactions that crossed year-end. Absent those outflows, organic deposit growth continued as
expected. Entering the second quarter, we continue to watch deposit levels and expect some continued volatility
from atypically large commercial transactions.
Interest-bearing deposit costs of 22 basis points for the quarter was down 2 basis points from year-end and likely
represents the low point of the cycle. While competitor deposit pricing remains muted, we are starting to see
increases in the most rate sensitive of the deposit categories. An example would be municipal deposits that track
some of the state investment indices. On the investment front, with rates increasing, we deployed some liquidity
during the quarter. Total investments were up approximately $1.2 billion. Remaining patient in deploying our
excess liquidity continues to benefit the bank as rates continue to rise.
At quarter end, liquidity remained strong with an excess of $4 billion yet to be deployed. Of note, our securities
book of $6.5 billion is approximately 47% available for sale, 53% held to maturity. The rapid rise in rates resulted
in unrealized losses on the AFS securities that combined with dividends and net of the bank's earnings resulted in
a small $0.30 reduction in tangible book value. On a percentage basis, this is 0.5 of 1% of the year-end tangible
book.
As rising rates and rate sensitivity remain a topic of interest, I want to reiterate some of what we discussed on the
last quarter's call. First, we remain very asset sensitive and well-positioned to benefit from rising rates. As shown
in our presentation materials, 80% of our loans re-price or mature within a year. To reinforce Ed's earlier
comments we're early in the rate cycle. We continue to believe each 25 basis point increase in rates will generate
approximately $40 million to $50 million in pre-tax net interest income on an annualized basis and approximately
a 10 basis point improvement in the margin. To be more specific on the margin, for the quarter, the margin
improved 6 basis points on a reported basis, 10 points excluding PPP. On our last call, we suggested that the
consensus rate forecast could result in a margin approaching 3% by year-end. With more current projections, it's
likely we will meet that target much earlier than anticipated and may approach 3.25% by year-end. On the capital
front, there was very little change in the bank's capital as earnings supported the quarter's growth. Capital
remains appropriate on a risk-adjusted basis.
Lastly, we continue to be pleased by our market momentum. In past quarters, we've highlighted the recognition
the bank received from Greenwich regarding the satisfaction of our commercial clients. This quarter we learned
the bank was ranked highest in retail customer satisfaction by J.D. Power and Associates for Illinois. For six
consecutive years, we've ranked first or second in customer satisfaction, something we're proud of and it speaks
to the strength of our retail banking franchise.
With that, I'll hand it over to Dave.

David Alan Dykstra
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Great. Thanks, Tim. As usual, I'll cover some of the noteworthy income statement categories starting with the net
interest income. For the first quarter of 2022, net interest income totaled $299.3 million. This was an increase of
$3.3 million as compared to the prior quarter and an increase of $37.4 million as compared to the first quarter of
2021.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
The components of the $3.3 million increase in net interest income as compared to the prior quarter are as
follows. $16.7 million of the increase related to earning asset growth and an improvement in the net interest
margin with that increase offset by approximately $6.7 million less net interest income due to two fewer days in
the quarter and another $6.7 million decrease due to less PPP interest income in the quarter. The margin
improved 6 basis points from the prior quarter to 2.61%. A beneficial decline of 3 basis points for the rates paid on
liabilities combined with the 3 basis point increase on the yield on earning assets resulted in the improved net
interest margin. The increase in the yield on earning assets in the first quarter as compared to the prior quarter
was primarily due to the impact of investing a portion of our short term liquid assets into longer term higher
yielding securities during the quarter resulting in an overall yield on our liquidity management assets increasing by
26 basis points. The decrease in the rate paid on net interest-bearing liabilities in the first quarter of 2022
compared to the prior quarter is driven by a 2 basis point decrease in the rate paid on net interest-bearing
deposits, primarily due to lower re-pricing of time deposits. I think it's important again to note that the net interest
income expanded despite less interest income from the PPP portfolio and the two fewer days in the quarter. And
also the net interest margin, excluding the impact of the PPP portfolio, increased by 10 basis points.
Turning to the provision for credit losses, Wintrust recorded a provision for credit losses of $4.1 million compared
to a provision of $9.3 million in the prior quarter and the $45.3 million negative provision recorded in the year-ago
quarter. Provision expense in the first quarter was driven largely by loan growth, excluding PPP loans of
approximately $796 million offset by a small decrease in net charge-offs and an improvement in the loan portfolio
characteristics during the quarter, including improving loan risk rating migration. Rich Murphy will cover credit
quality and additional detail in just a few minutes.
Turning to the other non-interest income and non-interest expense sections, in the non-interest income section,
our wealth management revenue declined by $1.1 million to a level of $31.4 million in the first quarter. This
compared to $32.5 million in the prior quarter, but was up 7% from amount recorded in the prior year. The slight
decline in revenue source was negatively impacted by lower equity market valuations, which impact the pricing on
a portion of our managed asset accounts along with slightly lower brokerage trading activity and associated
revenue. But all in all, it was still a strong quarter for our wealth management division and we're pleased with the
results there.
Consistent with overall industry trends and the impact of higher home mortgage rates, our mortgage banking
operations saw lower loan origination volumes during the first quarter, with lock adjusted origination volumes
down approximately 24%. This production volume was less than the gains we provided in the prior quarter
earnings release due to the substantial rise in mortgage rates subsequent to that time. However, our mortgage
banking revenue actually increased $24.1 million to $77.2 million in the first quarter of 2022. Revenue was higher
in the current quarter primarily due to a positive valuation adjustment on our portfolio of mortgage servicing rights.
This was offset by lower lock adjusted origination volume and a compressed production margin.
The company recorded a positive $43.4 million valuation adjustment in the first quarter of 2022 related to the
mortgage servicing rights compared to a positive valuation adjustment of $6.7 million in the prior quarter. The
company purposefully build up its servicing portfolio for the last few years in order to not only maintain the
customer relationship, but to provide an economic hedge against the impact of rising rates on loan origination
revenue. Although point in time MSR valuation changes and fluctuations in quarterly origination volumes rarely
work as perfect hedges, the general relationship was effective this quarter and helped the company maintain
strong overall mortgage banking revenue as the economy transitions to a higher rate environment.
The sharp and rapid increase in interest rates during the quarter that benefited the MSR valuation in other
segments of the company, introduced headwinds though that impacted the mortgage production volume and

margins. The impact of the volatility on secondary marketing results as well as competitive pressures were the
drivers of the lower production margin reported during the quarter.
Looking forward to the second quarter, based on the current pipeline activity and the market conditions, we
expect mortgage originations to be very similar to the origination volumes experienced in the first quarter with
production margins in the 2% to 2.25% range. Other non-interest income totaled $18.6 million in the first quarter,
which was relatively stable with the $18.2 million recorded in the prior quarter.
Turning to non-interest expenses, they totaled $284 million in the first quarter of 2022 and were relatively
consistent with the prior quarter total of $283.4 million. In fact, looking back over the last six quarters, total non-
interest expenses have remained on a very tight band ranging from $280.1 million to $286.9 million and the
current quarter lands well within that range. So the company has been able to control the overall non-interest
expenses despite significant growth in the balance sheet over that time horizon.
Despite the consistent level managed expenses, there were a handful of categories that showed variance that I'll
address. Salaries and employee benefit expense increased by $5.2 million from the first quarter as compared to
the fourth quarter of last year. The current quarter increase was primarily related to $1 9 million of higher
commissions and incentive compensation program expense due to higher accruals for our long-term and short-
term incentive compensation programs associated with the increased earnings level. Additionally, approximately
$2.9 million of the increase was related to employee benefit expenses, which were due to higher payroll taxes and
401(k) match contribution accruals, which tend to be elevated in the first quarter of the year.
Advertising and marketing expenses decreased by $2.1 million from the first quarter. The decrease relates
primarily to reduced level of mass media and digital advertising campaign costs. The miscellaneous expense
category totaled $23.1 million in the first quarter compared to $24.3 million in the fourth quarter, representing a
decrease of $1.2 million and this decrease was primarily impacted by a lower level of travel and entertainment
expenses.
Other than those expense categories just discussed, no other expense category had a change of more than
$900,000 and all those expense categories in the aggregate were down by approximately $1.1 million compared
to the fourth quarter of 2021. The net overhead ratio, a measure of operational efficiency, stood at 1%, which is
down 21 basis points from the 1.21% recorded in the fourth quarter. The ratio benefited from increased mortgage
banking revenue and I should note the efficiency ratio improved to 61% in the first quarter from 66% in the prior
quarter, which was aided by an improving net interest margin and gains on the MSR portfolio during the quarter.
In summary, core fundamentals were strong with growth in pre-tax, pre-provision income, an expansion of the net
interest income despite PPP loan reductions and the fewer days in the quarter, improved net overhead and
efficiency ratio, strong loan pipelines and very good credit quality metrics.
So with that, I'll conclude my comments and turn it over to Rich Murphy to discuss credit.

Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Dave. As noted earlier by Ed and Dave, credit performance for the first quarter was very solid from a
number of perspectives. As detailed on slide 7 of the deck, loan growth for the quarter net of PPP was just under
$800 million or 9% annualized. Equally as important and similar to the past few quarters, we saw loan growth
across the portfolio, specifically life insurance premium finance loans which were up $311 million, core CRE loans

which were up $245 million, commercial premium finance loans which were up $82 million and residential real
estate and core C&I loans both showed solid growth.
Year-over-year, we saw total loan growth of $5.1 billion or 17% net of PPP loans. This total included $578 million
of agency finance loans acquired from Allstate. [indiscernible] (00:18:51) portfolio, by the way, continues to
perform very well relative to the initial business case, which we had laid out previously.
As noted on our prior earnings call, we continue to see very solid momentum in our core C&I and CRE portfolios.
Pipelines have been strong throughout this past four quarters and we saw that materialize into increased
outstandings during the past several quarters. We continue to be optimistic about loan growth for the remainder of
2022 for a number of reasons. Our core pipelines continue to be very strong with solid momentum in Q1. Line
utilization as detailed on slide 19 continues to trend up from 36.7% to 41% when netting out our mortgage
warehouse lines. We anticipate that this trend will continue. Also on slide 19, you'll see that business expansion
and inflation pressures have resulted in many customers requesting increases to their credit facilities to help
finance these costs. And also Wintrust Life Finance had another strong quarter growing their portfolio by 17% on
an annualized basis. This momentum has been strong for several quarters and we believe it should continue
through the better part of 2022. As a result, while macroeconomic conditions may pose a heightened level of
uncertainty, we are reaffirming our loan growth guidance of mid- to high-single-digit growth.
From a credit quality perspective, as I pointed out, hard to get much better. And as detailed on slide 18, we
continue to see that this performance again was across the portfolio and it can be seen in a number of metrics.
Non-performing loans decreased from $74.4 million or 21 basis points to $57.3 million or 16 basis points. A
meaningful part of this reduction came from the sale of an $11 million portfolio of loans, the majority of which were
non-performing. NPLs continue to be at record low levels and roughly half of where we were this time last year.
Charge-offs for the quarter were at $2.5 million, approximately $400,000 of which was a result of the loan sale I
just mentioned. As we continue – and we continue to see reductions in our special mention and substandard
loans as our customers continue to recover from the pandemic.
That concludes my comments on credit and I'll turn it back to Ed to wrap up.

Edward Joseph Wehmer
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, guys. Suffice it to say, we like our position. If all the prognosticators are correct on rate increases, we
should continue to perform extremely well. I'm looking forward to seeing that [indiscernible] (00:21:18) long time.
Credit stats are terrific. As [indiscernible] (00:21:22) getting better. We're going to continue to try – continue to call
the portfolio for potential problems. Kind of scary that you could have one loan [indiscernible] (00:21:31) almost
double your NPAs right now. But we keep looking deep and we're going to continue to do that. Loan demand
should remain strong through the year. Inflation should increase line usage numbers. Pipelines remain strong
across the board. Acquisition opportunities have picked up a bit. Pricing expectation is still a bit of a detriment
though, and you can count on us not doing anything stupid in that regard.
Very proud of the entire Wintrust crew and their earning the J.D. Power Award yet again. I read somewhere that
our numbers would have put us in second place in the entire nation. [indiscernible] (00:22:08) winning seven
Greenwich Awards. Again, Greenwich Awards are for commercial banking side of the equation. You have to
wonder why people bank anywhere but Wintrust. [indiscernible] (00:22:21) market disruption bodes well for
continued organic growth.

question please.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That sounds spectacular. Thank you. I'd appreciate it. So a question I want to ask about is sort of [indiscernible]
(00:23:15) expenses. Mortgage banking revenue or the volume sounds like it's going to be coming down. And I
think, Dave, you discussed sort of the $280 million to $290 million range in expenses. Can you stay there and
does the lower mortgage volume, does that allow you to keep the expenses in that range for a little bit longer
period?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, it's a good question. I do think the mortgage – as volumes come down, the mortgage expenses will
come down some more. We keep working on that. So there is some positive expense numbers that come out of
that. As you know, as you go into the second and third quarters, our marketing expenses tend to go up a little bit
because of the baseball season sponsorships and just the community sponsorships we do in the summertime and
T&E tends to go up and we gave raises that go into effect in February. So there are some increases in expenses
that we might see in the second quarter. We do think mortgage expenses will come down. We're certainly
attempting to control the other expenses. So there might be just a tad of overall increase, but it shouldn't be
extraordinarily high. Just maybe they bump up a little bit, but can we keep them in that range? Possibly, but might
be just a little bit higher.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I think you have to look at that overhead ratio, which we expect to be right around between – for the whole year
about 125 to 130, somewhere in that. So [indiscernible] (00:24:59) 1% in the first quarter to probably be around
130 to 135 I think the rest of the year would be a good number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long A
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yeah, that's what we think. If you took out the MSR that we gained this quarter and just had a look at the rest of
that excluding that valuation, we'd be in that 130 to 135 range. So we think that that's reasonable. And you have
to understand that we do think the revenue in that scenario goes up quite a bit too with the margin increase. So
we still think that we have good operating leverage and we'll have growth on the balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Got it. Cool. And then as it relates to the rate hikes, with the beach ball being released here and should see
some acceleration in the net interest income, how much of that falls to the bottom line? Will almost all that fall to
the bottom line or does that allow you to take on any additional projects or are there any other expenses that
you'd have to add with several rate hikes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
[indiscernible] (00:26:03) to wages. Inflation raging right now, we will have to wait and see how that plays out. But
I would imagine that our mid-year – we usually don't like to do a lot of mid-year increases, but I think this year
we're going to have to, keep everybody happy and in line. I mean, we've got a lot of good things going on here.
It's all to our people. We've got to keep our people happy because again there's a lot of poaching going on out
there as we speak, but a very deep bench and we're able to fill where we do get poached and disruption in the
market's helping a little bit there too in terms of being able to bring people in. So I guess I would...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Probably – I mean the other thing – I mean people ask us all the time, well, if you make more money, will you just
invest a lot more into technology and some of those other initiatives and I think the answer, we – our approach on
that is we've always sort of had a rolling three-year initiatives plan and technology plan and investments to
continue to increase the mobile and digital benefits that our customers see and our team's pretty full up from a
resource capacity executing on that plan. So are there things at the margin you might spend on it if you have it,
maybe, but nothing significant because our play is full doing the things we plan to do anyway.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, just – the futures market is projecting cuts in a couple years. Like we're going to raise and then we're going
to apparently cut. So I was wondering if you – is there a scenario where you would just mitigate some of the
volatility?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
That's the plan. We're finally in a position where we again can [indiscernible] (00:28:33) rates go up and down, but
they're pretty expensive right now. We were fortunate when rates were really low, when pandemic first hit, put on
some – some derivatives have been helpful or will be helpful to us as rates continue to go up, but [indiscernible]
(00:28:54) expensive right now, but we continue to look at that. Understand it's a vulnerability for us right now and
we will continue to evaluate that to tighten the market a little bit and anybody else want to comment on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, no, I think that was right. I mean it's a little bit odd that we're a month into the first increase and we're
already talking about decreases. We've got another eight or so increases planned. The market projects more into
2023. So we look at it every day, Chris.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah and I would just say, you can go back and look at our prior 10-K and 10-Q disclosures and we have in the
past put on forward starting derivative transactions to address that kind of a situation, looking at the overall
interest rate sensitivity of our entire balance sheet. If you see those sort of opportunities, sometimes the cheapest
way to address that in the short run is a derivative contract and we certainly have done those in the past. So we
are looking at those things and we'll keep you apprised if we do it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Maybe one more. Your growth outlook has been, I would say, consistently strong above peers. You run the
capital structure more optimized than some of your peer. I'm just interested given the outlook for growth and the
remix of the balance sheet and also the concerns in the economy, is there a scenario where you would just
proactively come to market and just shore up the balance sheet even further to just make the capital position give
you more flexibility?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we've always talked about this in the past. The way we look at that we like to be very efficient on our capital
structure and we actually like leverage in our capital structure. We like having preferred and sub-debt and we
even still have some old trust preferreds that are very efficient for us. And so for us, it's sort of where you think
growth is going to go.
If you look at this quarter, we supported the growth. And if you look going forward and these rate increases come
through and your profitability goes up, if you stay in this mid- to high-single-digit loan growth area, we can support
that loan growth. So I think what we need to just do is look and see what's the outlook for growth. If it becomes
sort of super-sized, then yeah, to be opportunistic and raise capital to support that growth. We've always been a
growth company. So we would look to do that, but currently the earnings are supporting the growth and we'll just
continue to monitor.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe start with Tim. Your comment – I hate to ask the question, but your comment on
the 3.25% margin by year-end, what kind of rate assumptions are baked in to that commentary?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, Jon. We've got 200 basis points from this point forward in 2022. So 100 – roughly 100 in the second
quarter and 50 in the 2 ensuing quarters. Your guess is as good as ours as to what it actually turns out to be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Right. Okay. And then I guess the flip side of that question is in that kind of an environment, how do you guys
think about deposit pricing and deposit growth? Can deposit growth match loan growth in that kind of an
environment without you guys having to really take up deposit rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we probably will have to bring up deposit rates to attract some stuff, but that's built into our overall plan here
[indiscernible] (00:32:53) built into Tim's – Tim gave his margin numbers. Momentum is still pretty good on the
deposit here and the growth side. We haven't had a market product in a long time because stuff just came to us
basically. We just did a lot of name recognition stuff and in the past we always had market products and now
[indiscernible] (00:33:20) products again and see how that goes, but it will cost a little bit more to grow. We always
say that, but I think we're far away – it's far outweighed by the asset sensitivity on the asset side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
And, Jon, we haven't seen much market reaction, so other than deposits that are sort of attached to indices at this
point, everybody seems to have been pretty disciplined.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Got it. And I guess more the elephant in the room is just on mortgage. And, Tim, to your point, whether or
not 200 basis points comes through, but how would you guys think through that kind of a rate hike impact on
production volumes with the mortgage company and kind of what's the strategy to deal with higher mortgage
rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. I know different parts of the curve. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Right. So we consistently have been bringing in $300 million or so or $400 million of applications per month and
we expect refinances are more fall off. They were still kind of close to 50-50 in the second quarter, but my guess
is that's going to be more 60%, 70% purchase. We positioned ourselves really well and tried to service the
purchase market and do that out of our retail locations and with our local people being involved in the
communities and the realtors and the like, and so we still think that rates are [indiscernible] (00:35:10) got our first
mortgage at 9% or 10% we'd still think 5% mortgage isn't going to stop the purchase activity and so we think we'll
gain more than our fair share of the purchase market.
So we still think that we can maintain the volumes that we have right now and we'll see. There is a supply –
inventory of houses is hurting that a little bit too. I think you could have more volume if there was more supply out
there, but we believe we'll pick up on the purchase side and lose on the refinance side. But think, right now, based
on what we know, even with these sort of 5% level mortgages that we can maintain the production volumes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
And even – Jon, even it doesn't. When rates fall again, people will be back, just trying to market home equity
loans again because the cycle is [indiscernible] (00:36:07) rates go down and they refinance again. So we expect
lower rates and that's why we're positioned [indiscernible] (00:36:16) our margin goes up substantially to cover
the mortgage side of the equation. So I think that it's working according to plan. It won't always be perfect but the
margin should cover a lot of the other problems in the – in that – in the drop in mortgage business and we'll make
it up [indiscernible] (00:36:41) rates go down, it gives you mortgages and rates go up, it gives you other
opportunities. So that's how it's structured like we are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
But – and – I think you have to think about that interplay that Ed talked about, about the margin on the mortgage,
but we have built into the revenue right now $10 million, $11 million of servicing income, yeah, and then if you
look at those projections, the production income is what, say, $20 million, $25 million a quarter, but that's not
falling to the bottom line because you have commissions and other expenses. So the impact of the mortgage
business now from a volatility perspective should be rather low going forward and should be sort of dwarfed by
the changes in the overall rate environment and the earning asset base, the related improvements there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay, that's a good point. Yeah, it's clearly the balance pull through this quarter, but I think addressing the
mortgage thing helps. So I appreciate it, guys. Thanks.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Hey, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Maybe a follow-up on Jon's question. What are your thoughts about holding more mortgages on the balance
sheet now that rates are higher and then while I'm kind of on the balance sheet, just maybe talk about future
deployment of excess liquidity into this investment securities portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, I can talk a little bit about the ARM. We are seeing more ARM production in the marketplace right now. We
do have some opportunity to hold more. And this last quarter, as I kind of pointed out in my remarks, we did hold
little more resi. Going forward, I think you'd probably see a very similar amount that we would hold probably for
the second quarter. We typically will do that in-footprint as opposed to more of the national products. But
generally speaking I think that there is an opportunity there and we really like the space. I mean we had – in
earlier years we had a lot of resi on our books. Over the past number of years we've had a substantial loan growth
in other areas. And we really didn't – most people wanted 30-year fixed and so we didn't. So to Ed's point we take
what the market gives us. And right now it's more ARM production gives us that opportunity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. And then I guess on the securities portfolio, we ended up $1.2 billion in securities more at the end of the
first quarter versus the fourth quarter. So we did put some of those securities to work and you could see that that
impacted [indiscernible] (00:39:43) positively, but the rate increases will also help on the short term liquidity
earning there. So for the time being, we're still going to be cautious and...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Opportunistic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
...opportunistic and replace the runoff, maybe invest a little bit more, but we're not going to dive into the deep end
and put all $3 billion or $4 billion of excess liquidity to work right now. Hopefully, we'll start some of that up with
loan production and then we'll continue to slowly leg into it I think.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then as a follow-up question, Ed, in the press release, you talked about gaining new market share. I was
wondering if you could expand on that? Is that kind of Chicago, Milwaukee? Is that some of your national
businesses? And what's behind that statement?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
All the above. I think there's plenty of room for us to continue to grow in Chicago – in our defined market area.
There are a number of branches being prepared for opening right now. We're only, what, 6%, 7% of the market as
it stands. So, Chase and BoA and BMO have to look out because we're coming for them. I'm sure they're all
shaking in their boots right now, but probably hiding in the basement or something, but plenty of room for us to
grow here. I think we can capitalize on the awards we continue to get in terms of service and, as I said,
[indiscernible] (00:41:12). We give the best service bar none. Our approach works in that regard. High touch, high
tech stuff, works really well, but across the board we expect to have continued growth in all of our products and
services, get continued market share. We expect that every year anyhow. So it make any sense, I...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
A question on some balance sheet dynamics. I appreciate some of the non-interest-bearing deposit outflows was
somewhat transitory in the quarter, but also curious if that's a function of some of your commercial clients kind of
sifting through all the excess liquidity levels that are accumulated over the last couple years? As they work
through those liquidity levels, can we maybe perhaps expect some more of a meaningful increase in line
utilization? Appreciate it was only up maybe 0.5% or so in the first quarter. So just trying to think about what the
increase in line utilization potential maybe factors into that high single digit loan growth outlook for this year?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. As I pointed out in my comments, I do think that's a – it's a nice tailwind that we have. I think, as we pointed
out in the last several calls, line utilization through the pandemic and over the last several quarters was definitely
muted. But now we are seeing or if you just look at our asset-based lending group and as they work through the
requests from the – our customers in terms of rising supply costs, rising raw material costs, you're definitely
seeing utilization start trending up. We're also seeing expansion of the lines that are out there and you can see
that in the – what we included in our release, showing that there are more and more customers coming in looking
for expanded line facilities. So it's a good story for us, and I think that – that's – over the course of the rest of the
year, it is going to be a real nice tailwind.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Nate, to the first part of your question, the deposit run out was really related more to a handful of large businesses
that sold as opposed to a drawdown of liquidity, although clearly there was a lot of liquidity in the system and we
continue to watch how some of our commercial clients manage their deposits, but the fourth quarter was more of
isolated incident type situation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Understood. Appreciate that color and changing gears and thinking about mortgage expenses. Dave, when I think
about kind of what you described about a year or so ago when we saw a pretty decent decline in volumes in the
second quarter of last year, you spoke to the potential for the commission line related mortgage to step down by
about $8 million or so. Is that a fair kind of starting point as well to think about the commission line into the second
quarter within the context of what you spoke to in terms of just the overall expense run rate starting in 2Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, if origination volumes stay the same in the second quarter as the first quarter and the fourth quarter
origination volumes, if you kind of look at those relative to where they were in the prior quarter, they came down a
little bit, but I would expect that because the first quarter was down from the fourth quarter, the way it went
through, but you'll see a little bit of a reduction in commissions, but then if it flattens out and we stay stable, I don't
think you're going to see a dramatic decline because the production will be the same. So I think you'll see a slight
decline in the second quarter in the commissions line just because of the production dynamics, but then should
level out and we'll have to see where production goes into the third and the fourth quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Understood. But just generally speaking, there is a lag in your mortgage-related expenses compared to revenue?

Yeah, because we book the revenue based upon a locked production and the probability of close. But we don't –
and that includes the net revenue number, so sort of includes the discounted cash flow of the net revenue. We do
that on a locked basis, but the commission expense doesn't flow through until the loans actually close.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Young of Truist Securities. Your question, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for taking the question. It's great to see the strong growth again in the insurance book with life and
property and casualty. I know some of those areas, particularly life, will start to re-price into that higher 12-month
LIBOR. Is that ever result in some choke off of demand in either the life book or the property and casualty book as
rates rise?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
It's interesting. In my opinion, not really, because the crediting rate goes up too if they get any insurance policies.
So the credit rate goes up on the insurance policies, the spread's still the same and they make out, okay, you
follow me? So [indiscernible] (00:47:09) to take one of these policies out on your, let's say, [indiscernible]
(00:47:13) may be getting a credit rate of 5% before and a – and pay 3%, [indiscernible] (00:47:25) 2% on that,
now you're going to get 6% or 7% and pay 4%. So, that's – as long as that spread is there – the spreads had
actually contracted before. They're actually probably going to expand a little bit over time. So it will make this
product more attractive I think, so – and we still see...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
And rates really don't have an impact on the commercial premium finance book at all. So that's more insurance
premiums and whether you're having catastrophes or whatever it's going on in the insurance rates, but interest
rates really don't impact the commercial premium side at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, talking to some of our customers in the life side, they will tell you that there could be some effect with rising
rates, and particularly, as Ed points out, if you don't have that crediting rate change, that arbitrage gets maybe a
little bit squeezed, but you are seeing much more popularity of the product in general, much more awareness out
there. So we think that there's – it's a very viable market and will continue to do well through this year as rates
continue to rise. But obviously that is something that we're going to keep an eye on. But that product, as you've
seen, has seen dramatic uptick here over the course of the last couple years and I think it goes beyond just where
the rate markets are.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, where we might see a problem is in terms of competition. Somebody will jump in and they try to steal
market share and they think it's an easy deal. This is not an easy business. You have to have real expertise
[indiscernible] (00:49:10) that's the value add we give is that expertise we have in terms of structuring these and
[indiscernible] (00:49:16) lot of places and – if you do it the wrong way. These guys will jump in and think it's easy,
it ain't easy. So I would expect that would be a bigger issue than the market itself is competition coming in fighting
over 1 basis point or 2, but most people are pretty happy with the service we give and the knowledge that we're
doing it right, as opposed to some people where we have to jump back in and take it over and fix it and that's real
pain in the neck. We should be – should get paid for those and we do, but we – they leave us and they come back
and we have to fix it. So it's not easy business. It seems like it is, but it ain't.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And thanks for that. Just another question just on the deposit side, is there any interest to term out any
deposits kind of earlier in the rate hike cycle to give more benefit later on or I know you've got a lot of CDs kind of
rolling through at pretty low pricing right now, will a lot of those just roll off? Kind of how are you guys thinking
about that book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I think – I guess there's two parts to that. The retail client base is usually pretty aware of rates and
so our CD book is down to 9% of our deposits essentially. We think they'll start to wade back into CDs depending
on the rates that get offered, but you got to go pretty – you got to go substantially higher to get people locked right
now. They know rates are going up. And again we're still pretty [indiscernible] (00:50:34) the futures market and
the expectations for a lot higher rates, there really isn't much higher rates yet in the banks. And so we haven't
seen anybody say they're ready yet, but we'll watch for it and as there's opportunities, we'll certainly take those,
but you see some people out there now with, for example 1% rates around a year and they don't seem to be
getting much traction, so...

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
I'm doing well, thank you. Ed and Dave, I know you guys always – you always have great color commentary for
the broader economic outlook. But when you guys think about kind of the mom and pop, this lower level C&I,
[indiscernible] (00:51:31) really think the global geopolitical events, Ukraine or anything to that extent really has a
lot of impact on their day-to-day operations, not nearly the extent that inflation does. So when you think about just
their operation, their demand for loans and combating inflation, do you think that there's any sense that they might
be tightening the reins or potentially increasing loans to shore up the balance sheets or kind of how the lower
level C&I market is operating in today's environment? And I get that [indiscernible] (00:52:04) mid- to high-single
digits is pretty clear, but is there anything that could increase that outside of additional talent added to the team?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I think inflation is the big deal right now [indiscernible] (00:52:24). So we see people getting the costs, small
producers even are getting their costs, they're able to pass them through. That's inflation. The cycle is here. The
spiral is here. We have to be very careful in terms of us getting more of that business. Yeah, we're always looking
at more of that – small business is very important to us. We're number one in Illinois and – in the SBA loans and
very important to us and we're starting to expand that. But Rich do you want to comment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, you hit the nail on the head. I think generally speaking, most of our customers would report that they've been
able to take those costs and move them through and pass them along and they're doing pretty well. I think overall
the consumer is pretty healthy right now and so demand across the board is in pretty good shape whether it's
housing or auto or any areas that you look at and so a lot of the customers that we finance are supplying lower-
end suppliers in that space and so generally speaking I think they're feeling pretty good. I think, as Ed pointed out,
where the challenge – the bigger challenges are just inflation, wage pressure and having to battle that and trying
to find good, talented people. That's probably the number one concern that people express to us.
I think what you're seeing is in a lot of spaces where people are really focused on efficiencies now. They're
looking more at automation, they want to spend the money and just try to make do with less and that's where we
can help a lot. Our leasing group has reported lot of activity in that area, lot of this line utilization is for people
making the spend to get more efficient and ultimately I think it's probably a pretty good thing but in the meantime
it's hard because people have to get through this period where talent is very expensive and hard to find.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Talent is a big part right now. I mean, especially – we don't have a lot of hospitality at all. We do have restaurants
and the like but people – they can't get people to work there. [indiscernible] (00:54:41) head of the Sea Island
companies like they have 400 positions open right now. They can't fill them. They can't bring people in from out of
the country like they used to in the high seasons and the like. So it's really kind of jazzed right now in terms of
that. So we see a lot of that, which means people have to pay more to get people to come and that's the inflation
cycle. Like I said, like a year-and-a-half ago [indiscernible] (00:55:13) transitory. Once it gets going, it's hard to
stop. But I think this – think a lot of people are getting freaked out about inverted yield curve right now. Think
that's a false positive right now because the government is still buying treasuries, keep their costs down. So I
think those rates are artificially not in good shape. It's not really true. So we don't see that right now as an issue.
But [indiscernible] (00:55:44) we do, but we will see the price. Lot of money is out there. Prices are being

accepted. Oil is a big issue in terms of commuting and what have you, but just going to cost more to live. Like
Ronald Reagan said, [indiscernible] (00:56:04) was free.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got you. No, that's great. And then kind of keeping on the same vein of talent, I know from the inflation
perspective of talent and then also Chicago seems to have a noteworthy deal every other year. So that's pretty
much the gift that keeps on giving to Wintrust simply because you guys have a great mousetrap. So when you
guys think about talent and the people of how to Wintrust kind of shopping their resumes, so to speak
[indiscernible] (00:56:39) compensation to come over to Wintrust appropriate, are people looking for too much
and then kind of how guys are just approaching the market disruption in terms of additional talent adds?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Dave or Rich will handle that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Okay. Well as we talked about in the past, the disruption obviously continues to help us. And there's a time lag.
And to your comment three or four events that continue to be beneficial to us, I don't think we're seeing anything
atypical for commercial lenders and compensation. We do see, obviously, the broader inflation-related activities,
but we think we're a good home for lenders. We think we take very good care of customers and for a lot of our
lenders, that's their primary concern. So I think we'll continue to benefit as the disruption continues to work its way
through the market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
We see it a lot at the lower levels. We run a credit analyst program with 30 guys. 30, 35 people every year come
through. After two years, they are offered god-awful amount of money, they go away and ever want to come back
when it's done. But they realize that they left the golden goose. But Rich you want comment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, I would say exactly what Tim said where – we brought in a lot of people out of some of the – because of the
market disruption over the course of the last couple of years. And I think when you talk to those bankers about the
culture and the fit, what they would say is this is – their number one job is keeping their customers happy. And so
our job is to make sure that we have the systems in place, we have the credit process in place and we can deliver
what we say, because that's just been, I think, a bit of a trick out there in the marketplace as there's been
acquisitions and different cultures come in and when a banker feels unsure about ability to deliver, that's way
more motivation than anything else. And so we've been able to, I think, keep our bankers and our customers
happy by just keeping a very core philosophy of consistency. And that's just not what we've seen in the
marketplace at all. So, fortunately, we've been able to hold on to our bankers pretty well.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2022
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Casey Haire of Jefferies. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, wanted to follow up on the loan growth outlook. The pipeline sound pretty
strong. If I heard you correctly, you said they're building. Just wondering if you could quantify what the 3/31
pipeline looks like versus year-end?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
We don't – we took the sort of the pipeline commentary out of that just because it's just always a – there's some
timing issues and some other things that go into it. And so we just really are focusing on the loan growth
guidance. But generally speaking the term building is the right term. We did see good momentum here in the first
quarter and as we go into the second quarter and that momentum really is again pretty broad based. We're
seeing it in CRE, we're seeing it in C&I, we're seeing it in some of these line increases that we're being asked to
provide. So generally speaking I would stick with that. But getting beyond in terms of the specifics and we're trying
to get away from that, really focus on the loan growth guidelines specifically [indiscernible] (01:00:33)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Understood. And just to clarify, the Fed hike forecast, I think you said 200 basis points. Is that what you
expect the Fed to be at by year-end versus the 50 bps level we are at today or are you expecting 200 basis points
of hikes, incremental hikes between now and year-end?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. 200 basis points from here, 100 in the second quarter and 250 basis point changes in quarters three and
four.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Whether that – again, whether that happens or not, who knows.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Right. So our thought on that is, $40 million to $50 million per 25 basis point increase and so you pick your
scenario on a – probably the math and go from there.

And obviously as we get into future quarters, we will have started to realize some of that benefit and so the base
