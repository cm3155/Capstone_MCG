Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Vince Calabrese our Chief
Financial Officer, and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer. FNB began 2022 with solid fundamental
performance and the full integration of the Howard Bank acquisition. We are pleased that the deal metrics
associated with Howard came in at or better than planned with a positive impact to our capital ratios. Howard
added $1.8 billion of loans to the balance sheet, bringing our total assets to $42 billion. In fact, on a combined
basis, FNB had strong loan pipeline growth in the mid-Atlantic region, up 13% year-over-year and 61% linked-
quarter. Our expectation is that the mid-Atlantic region will continue to grow with the exceptional employees and
new clients who joined FNB.
Additionally, we expect to receive revenue benefits from FNB's more robust product set as we offer these services
to the existing customer base already in the market. Earlier this month, FNB's board of directors approved a new
$150 million share repurchase program, providing additional flexibility to effectively manage capital and benefit
our shareholders. FNB reported first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $0.15 and $0.26 on an operating basis.
Revenue increased 3.4% linked-quarter led by net interest income increasing 5%. We remain well positioned to
grow net interest income given the strategic steps we undertook to position our balance sheet and benefit from
the current interest rate cycle. These include favorable deposit mix changes in investing in a short-term securities
portfolio. We remain well positioned with $16 billion of assets that are tied to short-term rates in this year.
Loans increased $2 billion or 8.2% when excluding PPP. While Howard contributed to the growth, commercial
loan production was more than a $1 billion, up 30% year over year. As we look ahead, pipelines have rebuilt from

our strong growth in the fourth quarter and are up 23% quarter-over-quarter. This gives us additional confidence
in our mid-to-high single digit organic loan growth guidance for the full year. Our fee income businesses
contributed another solid quarter at $78 million, essentially flat to the last quarter. Wealth management continued
to produce record results, with revenues increasing $1.1 million linked-quarter or nearly 30% annualized, driven
primarily by record organic sales activity.
Mortgage banking income increased $700,000 linked-quarter to $7 million, with significant interest rate volatility,
while rising mortgage rates are expected to reduce refinance activity, we are confident our diversified geographic
footprint and consistent commitment to the home purchase and new construction market will help us outperform
the industry. In fact, nearly 80% of our originations this quarter were for purchased money mortgages.
FNB's investment in technology has also enabled us to efficiently bring in more mortgage clients with 66% of our
mortgage applications submitted through our online eStore. As we continue to grow our balance sheet, we remain
vigilant in examining the current macroeconomic environment of high inflation, supply chain disruptions, and
geopolitical unrest. We have proactively assessed the risks and activated plans given the current environment.
Our credit team is continually monitoring the industries that are potentially affected by the rising interest rates
higher food, oil and gas, and commodity prices, and supply chain disruption. We will continue to assess the
environmental risks and adjust our strategy appropriately to ensure consistent performance while addressing the
needs of our key stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Gary to discuss overall credit performance and the
steps his team has taken to position our portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results remained strong and we are very
pleased with the continued favorable positioning of our credit portfolio as evidenced by our key asset quality
metrics. The quarter also marked the successful completion of the Howard Bank acquisition, which I am pleased
to report came over slightly better than expected and did not have a material impact to the overall credit portfolio. I
will provide some additional color on the transaction, including the day one and day two impacts to the reserve
levels, which I will touch on later in my prepared remarks.
Let's first review our GAAP asset quality results for the quarter. As I have mentioned previously, we entered 2022
with our credit portfolio in a position of strength, and with the newly acquired Howard loan book now reflected in
our total consolidated results, we saw only slight increases in our delinquency and NPL levels as compared to our
very low year-end results. The level of delinquency ended March at a very solid 66 basis points reflecting an
increase of 5 bps driven entirely by Howard, and exclusive of that acquired book of loans, delinquency would
have decreased slightly compared to the prior quarter. NPLs and OREO also reflected a small increase on a
linked-quarter basis against very low year-end results. With the GAAP level up 2 basis points to end March at 40
bps, which was again due to the absorption of Howard's portfolio.
Net charge-offs for the quarter were very low at $1.9 million or 3 basis points annualized as we continue to track
at historically low levels over the past several quarters. We recognized provision expense of $18 million for the
quarter including the $19.1 million initial provision for non-PCD loans associated with the Howard acquisition. With
the additional Day 1 PCD gross-up of $10 million, our ending reserve position stands at $371 million or 1.38% of
loans at quarter end.
Acquired PCD loans were relatively low and represented just over 10% of the Howard loan book. Absent the
Howard transaction and the associated provision and gross-up activity, our reserve level would have been down

slightly compared to December, which is consistent with the favorable credit quality trends we've seen. Our NPL
coverage position remains strong at 365%.
Regarding Howard's loan portfolio, we are very pleased with the successful conversion of the book, and the
ongoing tracking and monitoring our teams continue to perform to help us better manage risk during this transition
phase. Howard's credit book performed slightly better than we were expecting leading up to the conversion with
our loan risk profile and credit concentrations all remaining satisfactory. We look forward to the additional lending
opportunities and access to the expanded customer base within our mid-Atlantic footprint which helps support our
overall loan growth objectives and provides us with deeper opportunities for our other fee-based services. I would
like to congratulate the team for their tireless efforts to close the transaction and expand our position in this highly
desirable market.
I would now like to briefly touch on recent global and macroeconomic activity that we have been monitoring,
including the potential effect on our borrowers and the markets in which we operate. With the ongoing challenges
of widespread inflation, elevated input costs, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and geopolitical
influences, we are focused on these factors in our underwriting and in our credit discussions to address and
mitigate these risks up-front.
While we have not seen any material impact to our credit portfolio at this time, we remain vigilant and have
tailored our credit decisioning approach to address the impact that these various factors could have on a
borrower's EBITDA and margin levels, including the effects of fluctuating operational and supply costs, as well as
potential interest rate sensitivities that may lead to increased borrowing costs. That said, we have been very
proactive in utilizing interest rate instruments to provide borrowers the option to fix their borrowing costs and
reduce their sensitivity to the rising rate environment.
In closing, we remain very pleased with the position of our portfolio and the successful acquisition of Howard
Bank, and we remain focused on the year ahead to manage our growing credit book through a potentially softer
economic environment. Maintaining our strong credit culture stands front and center, and we are well-prepared
and remain proactive in our approach to quickly identify and better manage emerging risks in our loan portfolio.
Our disciplined credit framework is built on a foundation of consistent underwriting, attentive risk management,
and selectivity of high quality lending opportunities, all of which has served us well and positions us for the year
ahead. I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary. As Vince mentioned, we are very excited about the Howard acquisition and the potential this deal
offers to continue growing our fee-based revenues. As of the merger closing date, loans and deposits were both
$1.8 billion with 43% of deposits in noninterest-bearing accounts. In terms of significant items, the first quarter had
$28.6 million in merger-related expenses, $19.1 million of initial provision for non-PCD loans, and $4.2 million in
branch consolidation costs. In conjunction with the acquisition, FNB issued a little over 34 million shares of
common stock at $12.99 in exchange for 18.9 million shares of Howard common stock. Going forward, Howard
will be included in all of our reported numbers, including guidance as they're now part of FNB.
With that, let's turn to slide 5 to discuss the first quarter financials, starting with the highlights. First quarter
reported EPS totaled $0.15 and $0.26 on an operating basis after adjusting for the Howard-related items and
branch consolidation costs previously noted. But excluding PPP and Howard loans as of the acquisition date,
which is more reflective of underlying loan growth, period end total loans increased $259.7 million or 4.3%

annualized on a linked-quarter basis, including an increase of $81.7 million in commercial loans and leases and
$178 million in consumer loans. Average loans, excluding PPP and Howard, increased $440 million or 7.4%
annualized.
Let's continue with the balance sheet on slide 7. First quarter average securities reached $7.0 billion, an increase
of $469 million from the prior quarter as we increased our investing activity, take advantage of the higher interest
rate environment. Securities growth, coupled with the loan growth, contributed to a 3.9% increase in total average
earning assets. Average deposits excluding Howard totaled $31.7 billion, an increase of 7.8% year-over-year,
reflecting continued organic growth in households and account balances partially offset by decline in time
deposits, given customer preferences to move funds into liquid accounts.
Turning to slide 8, net interest income totaled $234.1 million, an increase of $10.8 million or 4.8% from the prior
quarter, primarily due to growth in average earning assets and initial benefits from the higher interest rate
environment, partially offset by the $4.2 million decreased contribution from PPP. Our net interest margin
increased 6 basis points to 2.61%, reflecting the early stages of benefiting from upward movement in interest
rates. Total impact of PPP, purchase accounting accretion, and higher cash balances on net interest margin was
a reduction of 13 basis points for the quarter, similar to the 14 basis point reduction last quarter.
Now let's look at non-interest income and expense. Non-interest income totaled $78.3 million essentially flat in the
prior quarter. We have previously mentioned the strategy of investing in our diversified fee-based businesses and
this quarter again demonstrates its importance. For example the insurance commissions and fees increase of
$2.3 million linked-quarter offset the capital markets decrease of $2.4 million as they reverted from elevated levels
in the fourth quarter. We expect our diversified fee income strategy to be advantageous as we continue along the
economic cycle.
Reported non-interest expense increased $45.8 million or 25.2% linked-quarter on an operating basis non-interest
expense increased $13.9 million or 7.7% to $194.6 million excluding merger-related expenses and branch
consolidation costs from the current and prior quarters.
On an operating basis, salaries and employee benefits increased $8.1 million or 7.8% linked-quarter, primarily
related to normal seasonal long term compensation expense of $6.2 million in the first quarter of 2022, as well as
seasonally higher employer-paid payroll taxes. Also included in the quarter total is a little over two months' of
salaries and benefits for the Howard employees that joined FNB. Occupancy and equipment increased $3.1
million or 10.1%, primarily due to higher seasonal utilities cross, bank shares and franchise taxes increased $2.3
million due to the recognition of state tax credits in the prior quarter.
Efficiency ratio equals 60.7% compared to 58.7%. Higher efficiency ratio resulted from nearly $20 million of lower
PPP and purchase accounting accretion income versus a year ago, excluding PPP and PAA, our efficiency ratio
would have improved around a 220 basis points year-over-year. We expect improvement from this quarter's
efficiency ratio moving forward with a positive impact from expected rate hikes and synergies in revenue and
expense associated with Howard. Tangible book value per share decreased linked-quarter to $8.09, primarily
related to $202 million or $0.57 per share and accumulated other comprehensive loss as of March 31, 2022,
reflecting the impact of higher interest rates on the fair value of AFS securities.
This compares to a $62 million or $0.19 negative impact at the end of the prior quarter. Increased unrealized
losses in the AFS portfolio due to rising interest rates should come back into capital over time as securities
mature or prepay.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
During the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock with a weighted
average share price of $13.25 for a total of $29.8 million. To date, FNB repurchased $111 million under the
program approved in September 2019. Earlier this month, our board approved a new $150 million share
repurchase program, continuing to provide FNB with the tools to optimize capital management and enhance
overall shareholder returns.
Now let's turn to guidance on page 12. We expect loans to increase in the low double digits to low teens with
underlying organic growth in the mid to high single digits on a year-over-year spot basis. Total deposits projected
to grow high single digits on a year-over-year spot basis. Full year net interest income is expected to be between
$1.0 billion and $1.04 billion, with the second quarter between $249 million and $253 million. Our base guidance
currently assumes 125 basis points of rate increases for the remainder of the year, including a 50 basis point
increase in May.
Full year non-interest income is expected to be between $315 million and $330 million with the second quarter
around $80 million. The revised full year guidance is due to slightly lower than expected market related fee
income.
There is no change to our full year guidance for non-interest expense in the range of $760 million to $780 million
on an operating basis for the full year and $190 million to $195 million for the second quarter. This does not
include the onetime expenses associated with the Howard Bank acquisition.
Positive credit quality is expected to continue throughout 2022 with provision guidance to $20 million to $40
million. This does not include the initial $19.1 million of provisions related to Howard and is dependent on net loan
growth experienced throughout the year.
Lastly, the effective tax rate should be between 17.5% and 18.5% a full year, which assumes no changes to
corporate income tax rates and is dependent on the level of investment tax credit activity.
With that, I will turn the call back to Vince.

Thanks, Vince. We've worked hard to build a strong, differentiated brand, including our commercial lending and
wholesale banking businesses, our knowledgeable team and investments in products and technology results in a
commercial banking experience that is unique for its high level of convenience and sophistication. Our
commercial business ranges from large corporate clients to small business lending, including highly specialized
industry verticals, creating an opportunity for FNB to surpass the need to the most clients. Thus far in 2022, FNB
has been named as one of America's best banks and world's best banks by Forbes, received 17 Greenwich
Excellence and Best Brand Awards, and was recognized as a top Workplace USA by Energage for a second
consecutive year. These awards add to an extensive list of honors FNB has received for its differentiated culture
and business model which focuses on doing what is right for its clients, communities, and employees, and
ultimately benefiting our shareholders.
For example, FNB is increasing our closing cost assistance grant to $5,000 in April 2022, advancing our
commitment to borrowers in low-to-moderate income communities. We also enhanced our mortgage product
offerings through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to provide additional access for homeowners with income at or
below the area median income for their market. Our goal is to ensure all stakeholders benefit from the products
and services that we offer. Our first quarter results provide a solid foundation for us to continue building

with Piper Sandler.

Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler &
Co.
In terms of – Vince, you mentioned still lot of confidence in the loan growth expectations for the year. And I think
you said that the current pipeline is up 23% linked-quarter. And so I just want to follow-up on that. And is that the
commercial pipeline? And I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about that pickup, does it reflect supply chain
issues improving, is it more seasonal? Just wondering if you can frame a little further that significant pickup in the
pipeline linked-quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I can address that. I think it's pretty broad-based. If you look at the dispersion of our pipeline, we have a
little chart here for our own sake that shows the trending. You can see almost every region in the company has
seen growth in their pipeline on a linked-quarter basis. If you remember back in the fourth quarter we had a pretty
strong record production quarter for us. So typically what happens the bankers are busy closing transactions. The
pipeline kind of shrinks a little bit and then we start to move back into prospecting or accommodating borrowers
requests and the pipeline builds again. I think you're seeing that here.
The other factor is the first quarter is seasonally slower. You don't have the financial results from your corporate
borrowers to act upon. Typically the companies haven't devised their CapEx plans until now. So now is the time
when you start to see a pickup in the pipeline. We're very pleased with the growth in the mid-Atlantic region, mid-
Atlantic is up 13% year-over-year, 61% quarter-over-quarter. So we've got a big boost because of that Howard
acquisition, a lot of critical mass and scale, deeper penetration in the market and some great bankers that we
picked who seem to be pretty happy with our system. So, we're very excited about the opportunities there.
We also feel that, as I mentioned on the call, from a non-interest income perspective, we – fee- based businesses
that we have, we have a tremendous opportunity to penetrate that customer base with some sizeable fee
opportunities, and wealth, and capital markets. So I think that should help us in that market. So, that's a big driver.
Charlotte's up 33% year-over-year, 52% on a linked-quarter basis. So, there's, there's quite a bit going on in the

southeast. I just spent some time, spent a week in Charleston and Raleigh. And both of those markets are
performing very well, spent a lot of time with clients. And I think our brand is being received well in those markets.
We're pretty well established. We have regional headquarters that we've established in Greensboro, in Charlotte,
in Raleigh, and Charleston, South Carolina, with highly visible signage and a decent delivery channel.
So, things are starting to cook there. And we've expanded from a de novo perspective into Asheville, North
Carolina. It's been a couple of years now, so that's starting to pick up for us as well as Greenville, South Carolina.
We were on the outskirts of Greenville, but we have a plan to move into that market more heavily, which provides
quite a few commercial opportunities for us, particularly C&I opportunities.
And then small business banking, for us, historically has lagged from a growth perspective because we're
consolidating portfolios every time we did an acquisition that stabilized, and has actually started to grow nicely for
us across the footprint. So we're seeing a little bit of lift from our small business lending activity. So that kind of
gives you the landscape. I think it's more related, Frank, to, when you look at line utilization rates within the
company, Chris, Jen, and I were just looking at that data. What you see is a substantial drop off in utilization. So
borrowings declined post-pandemic, beginning of the pandemic, after the first quarter of the pandemic in 2020
things really fell off from a borrowing perspective for commercial borrowers. So a lot of those businesses went to
cash. They got stimulus or benefited from stimulus and drove down their balances and then a series of things
occurred which were unpredictable, but supply chain disruption, all kinds of things happened that kind of slowed
their ability to grow or expand. And I think we're starting to see a pickup if you dive into that utilization rate, even
though we haven't seen much of a global rise in utilization rates across all the portfolios, when you start to drill
down into it, we're seeing growth in the middle market now we're starting to see things pick up. So that's telling
me that yeah you know we're working through those supply chain issues, companies while, the wars in Ukraine is
probably a worry. I think companies are starting to get back to normal from an operations perspective.
Anyway that's – we're still – we still are very cautious, as I've said in my remarks, we're still watching what's going
on from a credit perspective because there are concerns right now about additional supply chain disruptions, the
price of oil and gas rising, and impacting certain industries. So we keep a close eye on it. But all-in, we're seeing,
we haven't seen any significant weakness anywhere in the portfolio. In fact, the credit quality is holding in there.
Hope that answers your question. I just tried to be as comprehensive as possible.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler &
Co.
Yeah. Yeah. That was helpful. Thank you. And I guess just as a follow-up, in terms of just given how strong – just
given your confidence on the loan growth picture, is there any room to ramp up the buyback at all? Just
wondering if, with bank stocks having pulled back a little bit, from where you bought back stock in the first quarter,
if we should think about that, maybe ramping up a bit. If we should think about stocks any differently than we did
going into 1Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I think, our guidance on loan growth isn't crazy. I mean, we're mid to high single digit growth. So there is
some room like for us to fund that growth with capital that we generate internally plus buy back shares. And that's
why the board approved the buyback program. We want to have options so that we continue to drive shareholder
value and kind of support the stock price if we see movement downward. And the company has performed
admirably over the last few years. So there's a lot of confidence in the board in putting forward a buyback
program.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Doing well. Thank you. Let me first on the mortgage banking outlook, you gave some good color on continuing to
expect that to be, I should say, outperform the industry going forward. But maybe, if you could provide a little
more detail on how you're thinking about how we should be thinking about sizing that revenue stream going
forward. Are you still expecting that to increase from here, or flat, or how from a – from an overall perspective do
you see revenue trending from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I'll let Vince answer that question; Vince Calabrese, but before he does, I will tell you this, the frontline has
shifted as we've indicated. We are very well-positioned across the Southeast and the mid-Atlantic in some fairly
dynamic housing markets. So we have an opportunity to benefit more heavily from purchase money mortgage
originations. And I think our current pipeline is sitting around 90%. So we purchased money so we did make that
shift, which provides some support, which is why I indicated in my prepared comments that we should outperform
this industry. We're not as dependent on refinance activity. And we are spread across the broad geography. It's a
very attractive market.
And about 50% of the franchise sits in very stable, more stable markets, which gives us some stability. And we're
able to maintain a lower growth trajectory, and then half of it sits in more dynamic, higher growth markets. We're
seeing more housing starts and a lot of activity. But go ahead, Vince. I don't know if you want to give them a little
bit more color on the top line and what were our expectations.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, no, I would say, for the quarter, you saw the results. They were up a little bit from kind of a low last quarter.
We were thinking it was going to be the low. The purchase versus refi mix, as Vince mentioned, positions us well
to focus on purchase there. For the quarter, it was 77%, and now it's up to – the refi [indiscernible] (00:34:27)
down to 5% of the total. So kind of the way our business is built is very well positioned, and the activity on the
purchase side has still been very strong, but I guess if you boil it down to the mortgage banking income, right,
that's a function of how much you sell and how much [indiscernible] (00:34:45) portfolio too depending on the
nature of the originations.
We've definitely seen some shift to customers wanting to get [ph] arms, 7-year 6 months, it's not one anymore,
and 10-year and 6 months (00:34:58). So we've seen some movement towards that. So that's up close in the
portfolio. So you have more portfolio, higher net interest income, a little bit less gain on sale on that. I guess if you
kind of boil it all down, I would expect mortgage banking income to move up from here from the first quarter.
We're entering the seasonal second and third quarters that are kind of high, but kind of around a level to a little bit
higher from here would be the best way to characterize it. And it's really going to be a function of the mix of those
originations, but they're still very healthy. Applications are very strong, and I think that the purchase market
continues to be strong so that helps to support the business activity there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
The other side of it, too, is there's quite a bit of activity in the consumer lending area relative to mortgage lending.
So outside of the mortgage bank itself, we have a surge in pipelines. I don't know, Gary, [indiscernible] (00:35:54).

Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We have one of the strongest pipelines we've ever had right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. So there's been a significant pickup. There was a lot of pent-up demand. I don't know if there was the
capacity to execute a lot of the construction projects. So I think we've seen a surge in demand across our
footprint, and I think it is pretty much every geography.
[indiscernible] (00:36:15)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So all of that leads to – the reason I brought that up is because ultimately that may lead people take out a
consumer loan, secure it by real estate, and then they roll it into a larger mortgage loan and it's taken out.
Anyway, there's quite a bit of activity. So we're feeling pretty good about being positioned along with the purchase
money opportunities and the growth in certain segments of our business geography.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's terrific color. I appreciate all of that. And maybe switching gears here, thinking about net interest income,
obviously, we're in a much different rate outlook environment now than we were last quarter. And you've updated
guidance to reflect that. How should we think about or how are you thinking about the change in the bank's
sensitivity to rates from the hike we just had all the way out to what you're forecasting by the end of the year. Is
there any impact? Are you expecting any difference in terms of loan betas, like what you're able to reprice on the
loan side? And then just remind us if you're still thinking that deposit betas end up around the 40% to 50% range
by the end of the year. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say a few things. As far as what's baked into the guidance, you see what we have in there an
additional 125 basis points, with 50 basis points in May. We get more than that, obviously, there's upside to the
range there. So, and I know everybody's modeling it with their interest rate projections. So, clearly, there's some
upside to the range depending on where we end up.
As far as the betas I mean, the loan betas continue to be pretty strong. As you know from the past, I mean we
have close to 50% of total loans that are tied to LIBOR SOFR three months or less on those two measures as
well as prime. So, $13 billion, 48% of total loans, so that benefits as rates move up.
The cash position we have, is benefiting while we still have around $3 billion, $3.2 billion. That was earning 50,
now it's earning 40, and then we would expect that to move up at the time that the Fed moves. So that would
move up another 50 basis points to get 50. So that's helping. While that cash is not yet deployed in loans, you're
getting a benefit there too.
And then the investment portfolio, we've been able to take advantage of the higher rates in recent quarter to put
some more money to work there, and you'll see that in the growth of the investment portfolio. So that's kind of

supporting the overall margin and PPP is almost gone. So, if you kind of put PPP on the side, loan yields were
actually up 5 basis points, kind of the continuing business is there.
And then on the deposit beta side, there's again none of us really know [indiscernible] (00:39:20) level liquidity in
the banking system, obviously, still a consideration for all of us. We do think we'll feel more pressure as we
continue to move down this path the Fed moves with kind of commercial municipal deposit rates being earlier in
that process. Our comp projection for us based on what we see and what we think would be [indiscernible]
(00:39:39) rate hikes coming through in total cost of deposit, so kind of 25% on a total deposit basis, and around
40% for interest-bearing deposits at the end of the year. That's kind of our current projections.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
At any rate, just maybe, Vince, wanted to walk through kind of the fee income side. Obviously, kind of a lot of big
swings this quarter with kind of the MSR fair value adjustment. You kind of have big moves in insurance to the
upside but capital markets to the downside. It sounds like a slight weakening as kind of the outlook, but is that
more mortgage-driven or are you seeing some things in some of the other business lines that you think will be a
little weaker as we move throughout the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
It's a combination of several areas [indiscernible] (00:41:24). I think the mortgage banking fee income in general
year-over-year is going to be challenging to meet last year's fee income obviously because it was so strong. But
the way we've tried to build out our fee-based businesses is to ensure that when one's not performing at the
highest level, we have enough balance within our offering to kind of make up for it. And the guide that we gave
you implies some of that shifting, as you mentioned. So, capital markets, we serve from a pure derivative
perspective, interest rate hedging. Obviously, a lot of customers, clients took advantage of the hedging products
during a time when rates were extraordinarily low. So that business has come down a little bit.
But on the flip side, in capital markets, we launched our debt capital markets platform. So we're seeing good
activity there, and good prospects there, so we're expecting to have a pretty decent year in that space. We have
invested in our international banking platform and added products. We're expecting to see some growth there.
We've had some really solid growth in SBA. We expect that to continue. So, our SBA platform that we shrunk and
then rebuilt and integrated into our – integrated more in-depthly into our calling activities across the company
versus being a standalone. Business is starting to take off, so those things should counterbalance fully the
mortgage and derivative business that's.
And then, wealth, wealth obviously, of course, we rely on net asset values as well right. I mean, if the market
remains steady, we should be able to benefit there as well because we're seeing a lot of organic growth. We're
very opportunistic in DC and Baltimore with that Howard portfolio and the fact that they didn't have a product
offering, we're starting to see some good opportunities there. And in the – in the Carolinas, so Charleston,

Asheville, Greenville are all great markets for us from a private banking and wealth perspective. And we're
starting to see some activity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
But Howard will be additive just across the base.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. You've added quite a few households, nice little commercial bank that fit in well culturally with
us that people there did a nice job, and we were able to take cost out but still keep the vast majority of the
frontline people. So we've added to our teams and those folks are doing really well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. They didn't have the same product set that we have today, the opportunity there on the fee side is
significant given the quality of the customer base that Howard has really across the board, wealth management,
cap markets, insurance, mortgage. So, there's opportunities across the different fee-based revenue categories,
that'll be additive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. So while there are challenges, I can't, we're not trying to hedge it, there's – it's going to be tougher in
mortgage banking this year. It's going to be tougher in capital markets, particularly centered around hedging. But,
I think, the guide that we gave you and we feel confident about because of our ability to drive fee income in those
other areas.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I think that's important too, right. So this quarter $78 million, our guide for next quarter is around $80
million, and then $315 million to $330 million. So, obviously we feel with diversity – diversification within the fee-
based categories that we're comfortable with those guidance range that we gave out. So which is higher than first
quarter level.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. Just following up on the prior questions, just as we look at kind of the cash balances, the 10-year
rate moved up pretty considerably. Are you guys thinking about kind of laddering some of that out into securities
and growing the size of the balance sheet? Or are you opting more for kind of remix than just funding loan growth
with the cash? So, we should expect a little less balance sheet growth but higher margins.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Given the opportunities with rates, I mean, we definitely put some more money to work. During the first
quarter, we invested $600 million into the portfolio, which is about $200 million higher than cash flows. And when
you look at that, the average balance was up almost a $0.5 billion. So, we take advantage of rates moving, but we

still stayed within our strategy of duration around kind of 3.5% to 4%, we haven't wanted to go long to date. And
as we sit here right now for the, for the current quarter at least, our anticipation would be to kind of reinvest the
cash flows that are coming on. And the rates are I mean, we were, in the fourth quarter, we were investing around
$134 million. First quarter, was up to $190 million again with the 3.5% duration.
And I think one of the things that's important for us too is, with the movement in interest rates, I mean, our
securities portfolio is 50-50 AFS versus health and maturity so, and it's on a short side. So, I think the AOCI hit
that we had was much smaller than others, depending on how they shop with their portfolio. So, that helps us
manage as far as that impact to our kind of book equity, but also helps us manage and create opportunities with
$1 billion worth of cash flow coming, the rates continue to move. We'll be opportunistic. Yeah, that makes sense.
We will grow the portfolio some with good amount here, but we'll just monitor very closely and look for those
opportunities as we have been doing.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Timur Braziler, filling in for Jerry. My first question, I guess just following up on the NII
guidance and looking at the guide this quarter versus last quarter, last quarter was fairly similar with expectation
for two rate hikes and I think 3% sensitivity if there was a third rate hike now going to five rate hikes with one that
already occurred and expectation for 50 basis points in May, I'm a little surprised that the guidance wasn't higher.
Is there anything else that kind of changed in the calculation of that guidance that offset some of that sensitivity to
the incremental rate hikes or maybe the kind of the combination with Howard, I guess, if you can frame that, that
would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would say, one place that we are conservative is on the betas because like we really don't know what's going to
happen there. With Howard coming on board and just kind of looking ahead from here, we'll see. We'll see what
happens. There's still, like I said, a lot of liquidity in the banking system. So, I think banks are going to be
methodical about moving rates up as you need to, but there's a lot of cash on their balance sheet. So, I mean,
that's one area where we're probably being a little conservative on the betas, but nobody really knows for certain.
Our – we moved the guide up quite a bit from the guide that was in the first quarter. And given what we have in
here, I know some analysts have more rate hikes baked into their forecast. So as I said earlier, if we get more
than 125 basis points from here, which the futures market, [indiscernible] (00:49:08) it's higher than that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Higher than that, so if you get more, there's more upside there too. So, I mean, that's those are the two things I
would comment on.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

here in the second quarter? Go ahead, Vince. I'm sorry.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Go ahead. Yeah. The net accretable discount overall was only around $10 million once you do the PCD gross up.
So maybe it's up to maybe $600,000 or a little more than a $0.5 million a quarter going forward, subject to pre-
pay.

Yeah, I can update, everyone. The – as I mentioned in the remarks, the portfolio came over better than expected.
We were very pleased with the information that we gathered as we got deeper – deeper into the transaction
around some clients that we had some missing information on up front and we were able to get very comfortable
with some of those clients and move those ratings upward to pass ratings. That helped tremendously from the
market perspective as well as how the portfolio performed through the quarter. The portfolio was very nicely
underwritten, it was actually the best underwritten portfolio that we've seen, and we expect it to continue to

perform very, very nicely as we move forward. As you saw in the metrics, the changes in the metrics were very
minimal. Generally speaking you know they're significantly higher than that. And from a ratings standpoint the
portfolio rated very nicely, very closely to FNB so very pleased overall with it.

Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I'm sorry, just for a second on the accretion. So the total purchase account accretion in the first quarter was about
$3 million pre-Howard and that number kind of would be projected to come down as it has kind of on a quarterly
basis. And then you add in Howard with kind of $600,000 a quarter that we were talking about. So net net you
know we'll be somewhere between $3 million to $3.5 million a quarter you know over the next few quarters all that
Howard plus what we had in the fourth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just one more follow-up for me. So glad to see that the pipeline
is being rebuilt. I'm just wondering as you look out at the expected loan growth this year, is the composition going
to be similar to what we saw kind of in the back end of 2021 or with some of these new digital initiatives should we
expect to see more of the loan production coming on the consumer side versus on the commercial side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well to start the year off we're seeing pretty strong production coming out of the consumer bank until, and I
attribute that to a couple of things. Some of it is just economic – macroeconomic. Some of it is the embedding of
the eStore into our mobile application and our online offerings. Basically, what we've done is we've pushed that –
we've pushed those products essentially, put them in front of the client repeatedly in those digital channels. So,
and they're able to act on it pretty easily or schedule an appointment and go out and see somebody in a branch.
For example, it's added to our online user base, we've increased online users 10% year-over-year. We have over
900,000 enrolled users now. Our mobile banking is up 12%. The number of mortgage applications that we've
pushed through our eStore is up to 66% of production, which is up from 59%.
We've invested pretty heavily in a number of areas, but if you look at the total eStore visits that I mentioned, that's
up 56% year-over-year. So that, for us, is a very reasonable way, right, to advertise our products and services,
particularly when there's macroeconomic factors at play. People need to borrow money for renovation. So that
that seems to be working for us. The data analytics tools that we've put into place, and the leads that we're able to
generate, the analysis that we do on pools of data in our data hub, that's helped us immensely. We can find
opportunities within that – in a systemic way we can find opportunities within the portfolio and then exploit them by
contacting those customers proactively.
And if you look at all of those statistics in total, there's quite a bit going on there and it's driving that activity. On
the commercial side, I think that, we're well positioned. We have very, very good bankers across the footprint,
they're high quality bankers. We don't have a lot of carpet baggers who's a lot of bankers that ran corporate
banking groups for a long time. There's a lot of bankers that move around from bank to bank to bank. We don't
have a lot of that. We have pretty sound, respected bankers in each of the markets. They've not [ph] gone to
around 50 times (00:55:25). We may have attracted them here for career opportunities. We really rely pretty

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Marks Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Tyler Marks on for Casey. Following up on Frank's question on the share buyback
appetite, how much lower are you willing to go below your target CET1 ratio of 10%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would say that's really the target that we're managing to. We're 10.0% for this quarter, and we were 10.0% a
year ago, and 9.9% I think in the prior quarter. So that's really the level we're using is kind our floor to manage to.
With the earnings generation capabilities plus the expectation for higher rates obviously that generates more
earnings, which is open for guidance. So we use that as kind of a governor, and we'll be dependent on the
amount of loan activity, the loan activity was lower for some reason, we've be more active here. But if you look at
what we did with first program we bought back $111 million at a very attractive price as I mentioned.
We were opportunistic when the opportunities were there [ph] and the market was dipping (00:57:06) and we still
think our stock is still very attractive value. So we will continue to be opportunistic. And we were down to $30
million or so. So we're wanting to approve new levels to give us that flexibility to manage capital. But 10% is really
kind of the governor that we're using. We think that's a good level for us in the overall profile of the company. And
as we move up above that, we'll opportunistically do share buybacks.

I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question? I...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Marks Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. How are you addressing the secular pressures seen with overdraft fees? And is your fee guide assuming
any of this impact within service?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Okay. Sorry, I didn't hear secular pressure. I was wondering what that was. So I heard, I know what you're talking
about. First of all, we had, we've rolled out a product that is Bank On certified that we recommend to clients,
particularly those that are afraid that they're going to overdraft or have an issue with overdraft. And it just simply
does not permit it. So, the product that we offer, just you can't overdraft the account if there is an overdraft
because of some POS transaction or some posting issue, it's refunded to the customer. So we have this product
that we rolled out, it's a top four product for us. It's actually the third most popular checking account product.
So it's already had an impact on overdraft fees for us. And we've made a number of changes over the years to
our overdraft practices and plan on continuing to make those changes. And I think we mentioned when we rolled
out the guide for the year on fee income that we were expecting that category to decline throughout the year. So
that's another area, add that to the mortgage and other capital markets area that I said, there'll be headwind
pressure that we have to overcome or make up. That's another category. I don't have an exact number for you. I
don't have it at my fingertips. But it's a pretty meaningful decline that we were expecting because of that pressure.
And there are additional changes coming to our practices, but it's reflected in the guide that we had given you at
the beginning of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would just add too that the consumer fees are about $67 million in the quarter.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. Just one last kind of clarification question for me is just curious if you guys could comment, you
talked about Howard going well and some of the appetite on the buyback. We're maybe putting the whole capital
deployment picture together here as we move forward. It seems like the fundamental outlook is fairly bullish for
you guys. Margins moving higher, growth pipelines are filled. The expense guide was unchanged. I mean how do
you view the new buyback program versus incremental M&A as you guys look out over the next 12 to 18 months
just in terms of the capital deployment priorities as you guys see it? That'll be great. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I mean we spent a lot of time modeling all of these things and evaluating them. I mean we look at loan
growth relative to buybacks from a return on capital perspective. We look at M&A in the same way. So our
decisions are based upon what's best for the company and the shareholders moving forward. So, we try to
balance that out. I think having the ability to buy shares back in the event that loan growth doesn't materialize or
M&A opportunities that are accretive and provide us with substantial returns over our cost of capital aren't out
there. We have another tool to essentially return capital to the shareholders. So, we look at it as kind of a
backstop and then we evaluate the options. So, I'm not ruling anything out nor am I saying that there's something
looming. I'm just simply telling you that we're very careful about the deployment of capital, and we look at the
effect on tangible book value dilution and the earn back and all of that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And the primary focus, the loan growth is the primary focus to produce capital.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
That's right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So, that's really, if the loan growth is strong, that's where we'll put our capital. If it slows, like Vince said, then we
look at the buyback and become more active on the buyback.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning. So, just the bigger picture in terms of better understanding your view of the operating environment
from a growth perspective, so on the one hand, we've talked about how pipelines are often and giving increased
confidence in that mid-to-high single-digits, and then on the other, the potential for a softer environment and
caution from a credit launch perspective. Just things you guys are focused on there. So does the mid-single digit
guide reflect a stable operating environment, growth environment, or are you dialing in the potential for some
softer growth in the back half of the year recessionary pressures? Just to help me frame that would be great.
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I think mid-single digits dials in the current environment, including the factors that we laid out, as potential
areas of concern. I don't want to alarm everyone. We haven't seen – as I said, we haven't seen weakness yet. But
those are areas that any prudent banker would look at and say, hey, we've got a number of things coming at us,
we have to be prepared to deal with, right. So that could potentially result in a slowing of the US economy and
lower loan demand. And it'll hit first in the commercial segment. There's some talk about consumer spending
declining in the latter half of this year. I've read that in a number of economists' reports. Some economists say
they think consumers are stronger than we expect. We'll see how that plays out.
If you look at what's going on right now and we only know what's happening at our bank and within our portfolios,
right. The consumer portfolio pipeline is up record levels, Gary mentioned. The mortgage business has shifted
pretty dramatically to purchase money. The commercial business slowed in the first quarter. We've had the war in
Ukraine and some supply chain disruption and a very robust pipeline. In the fourth quarter that was closed, the
closed [indiscernible] (01:04:43) converted to production and we've got some seasonal slowness.
So, our expectation, which is built into our guide, is that the beginning of the year would be slower. Things would
start to accelerate just like they did last year. We're in the same spot last year, a little better growth in the first
quarter than last year. And the consumer bank didn't have anywhere near the production and pipelines that we
have this for.
So I hope that sums it up for you. I'm cautious about our growth prospects as we move throughout the year.
Obviously, with Gary, and he's a very skilled professional, his team, Tom Fisher, the people we have here, we're
watching very carefully what's happening. And we're going to continue to monitor it because we don't want to
balloon into a recession, right. So that's why we're giving you the guidance we're giving you. But it's all baked in.
We've thought a lot about it, spent a lot of time modeling it. It's built from the ground up portfolio by portfolio. And
that's how we derived it.

Russell E. T. Gunther Q

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Sorry, I can understand it's confusing, right? Because, on one hand, we're saying, hey, we're going to achieve mid
to high single digit loan growth. Then on the other hand, we're saying we're a little concerned about certain things
that are going on in the economic environment. They could potentially impact that growth in the latter half of the
year. So I think given the geographic diversification, the quality of the credit portfolio, the skill of the bankers, we
can achieve our guide.

then could you give us an indication as to what the new yields look like that are coming on the book versus what's
rolling off there in that repricing cadence?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
The 12 month cash flow, we estimate, is $1 billion and that's rolling off of the yield of $174 million. If you look at
where we're putting money to work, so far this quarter, we've invested $150 million so far in April, yields closer to
3%. New purchases are still within that kind of 3.5 to 4 duration, a little bit on the higher end of that but still within
that kind of [indiscernible] (01:07:46). So that's kind of the moving parts there, Brody, if that answers you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And I just wanted to ask on the timing of the hikes that you all are modeling. I
know you have the 50 basis points in May, but beyond that, where's the additional 75 basis points coming in from
a timing perspective?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Chan A
Senior Vice President, Director of Corporate Strategy and Development, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, it's pretty much 1 basis point per meeting, Brody, after that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Thanks, Chris. I did have one follow up on the capital markets business could you remind me I know you
have a lot that kind of goes into it, but could you remind me what the big drivers are from a revenue perspective
within capital markets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Absolutely. We have syndications, we love large CRE and C&I syndications. We have a big derivatives practice
that I mentioned, which focuses principally on interest rate derivatives. But there's the ability to do commodity
based derivatives within that space as well. Then we have international banking, which we drove into the capital
markets arena because we're offering hedging products in the international space and spot transactions. Then we
have our, I call it, the debt capital markets platform where we participate in bond economics, public bond
offerings.
Now that business was started last year. And I think that pretty much covers it. Those are the principal areas that
drive the bulk of the revenue in capital markets. And the syndications business is lumpy, right? Because you get
big syndications, if you underwrite a deal, you're getting paid more heavily than the best efforts arrangement. And
then the debt capital markets area is lumpy too, because if you're participating in a larger deal, and we may be
getting syndications, fee income because we're participating in the distribution and we're getting now bond
economics, right because the companies issue public debt or included in the syndicate. Anyway, those are the
businesses that we have.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Got it. Thank you for that. And I have some two last ones [indiscernible] (01:10:04) the first one is on expenses.
Can you kind of maybe give us a sense for what would cause you all to be either at the low end or the high-end of
the expense guidance, just in terms of, are there any individual items that come to mind that would, that would
cause it to be one way or the other?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would say, as you know, we manage expenses very tightly within the company. We've had that discipline for, for
many, many years. Within our guidance for, for 2022, as we mentioned in January was $10 million cost savings
target. We have the cost savings from our, still to be realized given the timing in the quarter. Some of that's going
to be realized for, on track for what we initially said early on. One of the drivers is always commissions tied to
production. So that can swing depending on the business activity and the different businesses. So that is a swing
item. It could move from quarter to quarter, and kind of can get moving within that range. But, we'll continue to
manage expenses tightly as we always have.
And I think the range for the full year is a pretty tight range. So I hope they're really the key drivers for us and
we've talked in the past about RPA continuing to go after ways to automate our processes and making sure that
that's just continuous every day. And there's more opportunities to test some of that stuff to get done quicker.
There's opportunity there too. But again it's a pretty tight range, I'd say for the guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Thank you. And then my last question would be Vince I just want to follow-up. I appreciate the color on the
deposit betas that you all are modeling. I think it was 40% interest-bearing was what you mentioned and that
that's pretty, pretty in line with last cycle. And so I guess I wanted to for what you did on the interest bearing
deposit beta side last cycle. And so I guess I wanted to get your thoughts on, what's driving the beta to be close to
last cycle. I think a lot of folks initially, just given industry-wide improvements in terms of liquidity, lower loan-to-
deposit ratios off the cash, higher securities balances are thinking that maybe betas could lag last cycle, at least
on a percentage basis that you're assuming indicates that you expect them to be in line. So could you give us any
color on why you expect that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say, what we did the last time was probably would be around 50% would be kind of maybe the
historical rate, and things are quite a bit different as far as liquidity in the system. So, we're kind of inside that to
begin with as far as [indiscernible] (01:12:55). And then, as I mentioned earlier, again, we're being conservative
on the betas. We're going to manage them to optimize the gearings for the company overall, and not be more
aggressive than we need to be. So, as I said earlier, I think there's some conservatism baked into that. But even
at the 40 basis points, we're, we are kind of inside of, I think last quarter, we said 50 basis points, so we're at 40
basis points. And I think, the pace of the changes, the rapid nature of them, the large amount, 50 basis point
moves, it's just something we have to manage closely. And the customers get more alert as things are going
through. So, it's just for all of us to mention, but I would just say the 40 basis points is inside of 50 basis points.
Brody, I guess bottom line is that there's conservatism within the betas.

Brian Martin Q

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of follow ups here. Just the, the yield on new loans,
Vince, on commercial loans, can you just talk about where those are at, where those are coming on today?

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
[indiscernible] (01:14:12) new loans in total, I would say, came on at $309 million during the quarter. That was
$291 million last quarter so, so clearly kind of a nice move up. The overall spot portfolio rate ex PPP that's down
like $180 million, increased 10 basis points to $322 million. So, that's kind of all in features there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a couple other housekeeping, the line of credit line utilizations, it
didn't sound like that moved up a lot this quarter. Is that, is that fair? Is it pretty similar to what it was last quarter?
But the expectation is it's going to move higher. Is that kind of what I'm hearing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I think, with the debt capital markets platform, we did some larger transactions that were unfunded. So that
kind of, we got fee income. So we would expect those to fund up at some point. Right. So, we brought over larger
commitments with lower borrowings on them. That's part of it. The other part is, as I've said, I think when you drill
down into the various segments we saw certain areas starting to grow, expand, small business, middle market
banking on the C&I side saw expansion, and then we brought on some large construction deals, and those large
corporate transactions, which kind of kept us still or moved it back slightly, actually kind of flat but slightly down. If
you took those out of the equation, we saw an expansion in utilization. So I don't have the exact numbers for you,
but that's what we were seeing.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would add overall, if you look year-over-year, it did move up about 3 points from first quarter of last year to
the first quarter of this year. And then it's pretty stable to where it was at the end of the year, kind of in that mid-
30s. I would expect it to continue to move up over time. It was running in the 42% to 44% range historically. We
expect it to get back there at some point.

think about that, that clean expense quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. So like we said in an announcement, we expect cost saves to be greater than 50%. And we're well on track
on getting to the 85% phase in that we talked about during 2022. I mean Howard really didn't add that many
expenses to the quarter. I mean we're talking it's low – you know less than mid-single-digit million type number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So but I think we've got a pretty good handle on the expense saves and where we're going for the rest of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, Brian, I would think it would take some more like the third quarter to kind of get clean where – I mean
second quarter. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the just given the cautiousness about some items you mentioned just kind
of the reserve coverage with some of the noise this quarter with Howard. I mean where do you see the given your
outlook on credit quality seems pretty robust to that with some caution, just kind of with that reserve level, the
reserve coverage may trend to over the next couple of quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Gary what's your...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hey Brian. Yeah. In terms of in terms of the reserve I mean we've been very cautious all through the pandemic
and didn't have any large releases as you're aware. With the headwinds that we see out there with inflation,
supply chain, transportation costs, higher interest rates, those things as we've talked we're cautious about them.
And they do have the ability to impact borrowers that are on the lower end of the liquidity range or higher end of
the leverage range. We were flat in the quarter at $138 million even including bringing Howard on. We're
comfortable with that level right now and we'll continue to watch it all play out as we, as we move forward, despite
only 3 basis points of charge-offs. The other thing that's going to play a role there is loan growth. We've talked
about that a good bit today, and that has its impact. So I would, I would tell you that we're looking at right now, the
guy being 20 basis points to 40 basis points, could it truly come in on the low end of that guide based on the
strength of the book right now. Surely it can. But I would expect with all the headwinds, we'll be cautious around
those items as we move forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got it. Thanks, Gary. And then just last one, Vince Calabrese, I guess just last quarter, you talked about the
liquidity levels, kind of maybe cutting that in half by year-end. I think you're still a similar level on liquidity right
now. I guess, is that still your expectation or is these kind of how you're thinking about things?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, it's hard to say. I mean the deposits keep growing [indiscernible] (01:19:44) $180 million of forgiveness and
that's goes into the coffers too. So, I would think that's probably too low at this point, and we'll see how the year
plays out, Brian, but I thought it'd already start moving down and we've been saying that for six quarters now. So
those deposits are I think, plus growing. So I would think we'd start to slowly bring that number down. But the
pace of it is just hard to say with certainty.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you for taking the questions, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
All right. Thank you.
