Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Kelly S. King
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Ryan. And good morning, everybody. Thank you very much for joining our call. We really appreciate
that. I would say overall, this quarter and this year are very good given the challenging environment that we face.
We had a continued focus on our strong culture. It's activating very, very well. We're executing well on our
revenue synergies. We had really effective expense focus, and we made appropriate investments for the future
and, importantly, supported our teammates in difficult environment and kept our clients and communities number
one.
Our purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities. And we think in the times we live in today, this is
more important than ever. We focus on our mission. We focus on our values. I would point out to you that
regarding our values, ultimately, we focus most of our attention on the happiness of our teammates. In the
challenging environment that we face today, helping people get through the challenges they're living with at home
and at work and all of the various difficulties that people are going through, finding happiness in this environment
is a very, very important undertaking and we work hard to try to help that be possible for our teammates.
If you're following along on the slides, let's go to slide 5. I just want to point out that it's nice to say that you have a
culture. It's nice to say you have an important purpose. But it's more important to live it. So, I just want to point out
a few of the things that we have done that I'm proud of in terms of living our purpose. During the course of the
year, we launched our Seeds of Hope program where we helped our teammates with money to go out and
actually do little projects, little things to help people in need. We launched our Truist One Team Fund, our Home
Page program. Our Truist Cares program was very effective where we invested over $50 million to meet the
immediate and long-term needs of our communities, our clients, and our teammates. We provided over $100
million in special coverage for our teammates and 750,000 client accommodations, $13 billion in PPP loans. We
funded help for more than 80,000 companies and created also – or protected about 3 million jobs. And we did 355
small- to medium-sized grants in our communities.
I'm very proud of our $60 billion three-year Community Benefits program. I would say to you we are ahead of the
time schedule in terms of making those investments. We supported those who are historically underrepresented
through a $780 million (sic) [$78 million] (00:04:00) commitment. That does include $40 million in helping
establish an organization called CornerSquare Community Capital which is focused specifically CDFIs in the
minority space. And we're proud that we were able to invest $20 million over three years to support HBCUs and
their students.
On slide 6, let's talk a little bit about where we are with the merger. I want to make a point of context for you with
regard to how we think about our merger because this is a bit different than most mergers. It's very different than
many, many mergers I've been through in my career. We're not just putting two big companies together here,
cutting expenses and trying to improve profitability in the short term. Rather, we're building what I call a new bank.
We're building a bank based on the best of both – from both organizations. Then, in some cases, just new
systems and processes.
Like for example, in our commercial lending area, we've taken the very new and very best-in-class SunTrust in
senior loan origination program, and the BB&T banking system in terms of commercial loans. So, combined, we
have the best from both sides, and this is classically a case where a 2 plus 2 equals 5. We certainly could have
picked one. It would have been cheaper, it would have been faster, but it would not have been better. And it
would not have been client focused. Daryl's going to be talking to you about merger charges and other merger
expenses a little later. I just want to emphasize that, as he does that, remember that you have the [ph] normal
merch (00:05:39) that we called out early on in the announcement. That's normal [ph] signage and (00:05:43)

different systems that are just going away [ph] they're being – drives to helping the (00:05:45) future benefit. They
really are just a merger charge.
And then, we have these other investments which I call investments because they are. They're investments in the
future. They are making our organization better. It's client focused. And while they will not be in our own growing
long-term run rate, these are investments that we make today to be sure that we have agile, very client-focused
organization as we go forward. You see there a number of accomplishments for 2020. I'd just point out a couple of
those. [ph] Very important (00:06:20), we've made great progress in our culture, we could not feel better about
that. We established our brand and visual identity. We successfully [ph] merged first digital (00:06:27) conversion,
we believe, in terms of modern days in Truist Securities, activated our integrated relationship management
process which is pivotal to our success. We did consolidate 104 branches, leveraging our blended branch
program which is [ph] innovative (00:06:42). Remember, we did divest $2.3 billion in deposits with our 30
branches. And there have been a lot of corporate backroom functions that have been integrated, including audit,
risk, legal, finance, and others. And we importantly did a huge amount of work on appropriate job regrading for
our teammates. Daryl will comment with regard to [ph] some calls (00:07:06) with regard to that, but this is a very
important process in terms of making sure that our teammates, through the year, knew that we were going to do
the right thing in terms of looking into the new responsibilities, establishing the right kind of job and appropriate
compensation. And we chose to make that retroactive for them during 2020 because it was the right thing to do.
They were doing the job. We just had not had a chance yet to properly raise the compensation and that served us
very, very well.
In terms of 2021, just a few points here. Everybody tends to focus on the core branch conversion which, as you
know, is in the first half of 2022. That is very, very important, make no mistake. But look, there's huge amount of
conversions and other activities going on in 2020. 2020 is a really big conversion year. We will complete our
wealth brokerage conversion. We'll have our mortgage conversion, Salesforce conversion. We'll be closing an
additional 226 branches in the first quarter. We'll be implementing our digital first migration, supporting our T3
concept in terms of meeting our clients' needs on a seamless basis, integrating technology and touch to yield a
high level of trust. And so, there are a lot of activities that are going on during the course of the year. So, I just
didn't want you to be thinking there's not much will be happening at Truist with regard to conversion for the first
half of 2022 because, frankly, most of the hard work will be done by the end of this year. And then we'll actually
execute on the final branch closures and conversions as we head into 2022.
Looking at few highlights with regard to our performance on slide 7. I'm very excited about our revenue. Total
taxable-equivalent revenue of $5.6 billion, up 5.5% annualized versus the fourth quarter. That was really driven by
stable net interest income, strong fee income especially in investment banking and trading income, strong
insurance performance. Chris will talk about that as we get to questions in Q&A. I am very proud of five insurance
acquisitions just in the fourth quarter alone and we expect more activity as we head into 2021.
A very strong adjusted net income available to common shareholders of $1.6 billion. We had diluted earnings per
share of $1.18, a diluted return on average assets of 1.35%, and a very strong adjusted return on average
tangible common equity of 19.03%. So, you can say we're well underway to top performance and all the metrics
that we projected when the deal was announced which is kind of miraculous. It's been two years. There has a lot
been going on, but we're still tracking and doing really well in terms of hitting that top performance level of metrics
as we expected that we would.
Daryl is going to be commenting on some capital issues. I would point out to you that we – the board did approve
up to $2 billion in common stock repurchases which will start in the first quarter. We have outstanding credit

quality performance, much better than expected. And our common equity Tier 1 is exactly right on 10% which is
what we have projected a couple of years ago.
On slide 8, I'll just point out to you the unusual items for this quarter. And you can see there we have the regular
merger charges and, as I related to earlier, the incremental operating expenses that are not in the long-term run
rate. And they equated to $0.28 drag with regard to GAAP versus adjusted.
So, that's a quick look at the highlights. Let me now turn it to Bill for some focus on some key areas. Bill?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Great. Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everybody. As Kelly just noted, Truist is the first large bank merger in
the digital age. And with that in mind, we determined it was really imperative that our clients begin experience an
enhanced digital platform this year and this is demonstrated on page 9. While our foundation is two leading digital
experiences, we're going to accelerate the delivery of features like personalized financial insights, AI-driven chat
box, other client-centric enhancements. We're going to pilot this in both platforms in the second quarter, and then
we'll begin migration in waves in the third quarter, and complete full migration to a premier Truist experience for
our digital clients by year-end. So, emphasizing Kelly's point of how much is being done this year.
As you can see on page 10, we're experiencing excellent digital adoption and usage from our clients. So, for the
12 months through November, we experienced a 26% increase in digital sales, 12% growth in active mobile
users, 22% increase in mobile check deposits, and a 5% increase in statement suppression. I think all would
speak to increased digital adoption. This is an area where we're already seeing the benefits from our investment.
And on the right side, we show some recent enhancements. So, for instance, the SunTrust business online and
mobile experience incorporates significant updates, and it was built in-house to give us more control over the
app's functionality and performance long term.
The heritage award-winning BB&T U platform now provides insights to help clients better manage new spending
behaviors, including an end-of-month cash flow analysis and enhanced notifications just to name a few and very
consistent with our whole T3 premise. This is a prime example of what Kelly talked about with best of both, using
BB&T U client-driven front-end and a more flexible agile heritage SunTrust-driven back end. This clearly positions
us, I think, really well for the future. We believe initiatives such as these underscore our commitment to improve
the lives of our clients and demonstrate our investment effectiveness.
So, let's turn to page 11. We experienced further decline in balances across most loan categories in the face of
continued economic uncertainty and elevated liquidity. Average total loans decreased $7.6 billion, largely
attributable to commercial loan balances and ongoing run-off in the residential mortgage portfolio. In commercial,
average balances declined $5.4 billion, primarily due to line paydowns and lower utilization. Paydown activity
reflected larger clients' ability to obtain financing from capital markets and SunTrust securities was well positioned
to assist them which you'll see later. Commercial balances were also impacted by a $1.4 billion reduction in PPP
loans and the transfer of $1 billion in assets to held for sale following our decision to exit a small ticket loan and
lease portfolio.
We experienced a rebound within our dealer floor plan clients after bottoming in July due to OEM supply chain
disruptions. Dealer floor plan balances have steadily improved as new car inventories were replenished. We also
saw a growth in mortgage warehouse lending and government finance. Commercial activity remains bifurcated as
a whole with a greater share coming from large- and medium-sized companies than from smaller businesses. In

consumer, average balances decreased $2.2 billion. This was largely due to seasonality and refinance activity
that resulted in lower residential mortgage, residential home equity, and direct loan balances.
Average balances in our indirect auto portfolio increased $1.1 billion. Loan production was really strong as vehicle
sales rebounded, especially for us in the prime segment. Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic. We're hopeful
that the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, together with additional government stimulus, will increase
visibility, revive confidence and support the economic recovery, all of which will be essential for loan growth.
We're extremely well positioned in businesses and markets that we believe will most benefit from this.
So, let's continue on page 12 and look at deposits. Deposit trends remain favorable during the quarter. Growth
was robust and broad-based supported by a combination of seasonal inflows and ongoing growth resulting from
pandemic-related client behavior. Average noninterest-bearing and interest checking balances were each up over
$3 billion, while money market and savings grew $1.1 billion. Average time deposits decreased $4.3 billion,
primarily due to maturity of wholesale negotiable CDs and higher cost personnel and business accounts.
Importantly, we were able to able a strong level of deposit growth while maximizing the value proposition to clients
outside of rate pay. For instance, the average term deposit cost decreased 3 basis points to 7 basis points, and
average interest-bearing deposit cost declined 4 basis points to 11 basis points.
So, with that, let me turn it over to Daryl to discuss our financial performance for the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everybody. Turning to slide 13. In the fourth quarter, reported net interest
margin decreased 2 basis points to 3.08%, reflecting lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest
margin was unchanged at 2.72%. Core margin benefited from higher yields on PPP payoffs, recognition of
deferred interest on loans, and lower funding costs offset by excess liquidity. Earning assets rose $3 billion
primarily due to an increase in deposits, resulting in a modest improvement in net interest income. We partially
hedged our exposure to rising rates by [ph] owning (00:16:51) pay-fixed swaps to offset market risk associated
with our investment securities. The chart on the bottom left shows an increase in our asset sensitivity due to core
deposit growth, additional pay-fixed swaps, and the residential mortgage runoff, which is partially offset by the
growth in the investment portfolio.
Turning to slide 14. Our integrated relationship management strategy is helping improve fee income. Noninterest
income increased $179 million if you exclude third quarter security gains of $104 million. We have record
investment banking and trading income of $308 million due to strong activity in M&A and loan syndications, lower
counterparty reserves, and improved trading profits. We also generated record commercial real estate income of
$123 million driven by structured real estate transactions and strong production and sales activity at Grandbridge.
Insurance income grew 7% versus fourth quarter 2019 due to strong production and premium growth as well as
acquisitions. Organic growth was 2.9%. If you exclude the Truist policy placed last year, organic growth was
4.9%. We completed five insurance acquisitions during the fourth quarter, which we expect will add more than
$110 million in annual revenue and approximately $7 million in adjusted expense.
Turning to slide 15. Noninterest expense increased $78 million, reflecting a $99 million increase in merger costs.
Adjusted noninterest expense rose $27 million due to higher professional fees for strategic technology projects
and higher personnel expense. Personnel expense increased $50 million, reflecting higher incentives related to
strong revenue production and the impact of our job regrading process which concluded late last year. Job
regrading resulted in the fourth quarter catch-up in personnel expense, approximately $60 million of this was

related to prior quarters. Through this effort, we were able to honor our commitment to establish jobs and rewards
programs that harmonizes all teammates in the combined framework. FTEs decreased 1,300 during the quarter
and were down 8% since the merger was announced. We closed 104 branches during the quarter, bringing the
full-year total to 149. Net occupancy decreased e$26 million, benefiting from aggressive closures of non-branch
facilities.
Turning to slide 16. As we said, we are seizing the opportunity to build best of both franchise. This approach is
harder than a typical acquisition, but we believe the benefits to our clients justify the effort. Since the merger was
announced, we have incurred $1.2 billion of merger-related and restructuring expenses. These expenses have no
future benefit and are not part of the post-conversion run rate. We also incurred $725 million of incremental
operating expenses related to the merger. These expenses do provide future benefits and are integral to building
the best of both franchise. The incremental operating expenses are not part of future run rate and will end after
the conversions in 2022. Based on our integration plan, we expect the merger-related and restructuring charges
of approximately $2.1 and a total incremental operating expenses of approximately $1.8 billion. This results in a
combined total charges of approximately $4 billion.
Turning to slide 17. Strong credit performance was characterized by minimal increase in NPAs and an excellent
loss experience resulting in lower provision expense. We saw favorable trends in problem loan formation as the
criticized and classified loans decreased 8.4%. The provision of $177 million benefited from lower charge-offs and
a modest reduction in reserves. Due to decision to exit the small ticket loan and lease portfolio, the allowance
coverage ratio remained strong at 7.15 times net charge-offs and 4.39 times nonperforming loans. Active
accommodations were down significantly since the second quarter. Approximately 97% of the commercial clients
and 91% of the consumer clients who exited a combination program are current on their loans. Our exposure to
COVID-sensitive industry decreased 2.6% to $27.1 billion or approximately 9% of outstanding loans. We also had
the third lowest loss rate among peers in the latest CCAR test. We believe this outcome reflects prudent client
selection and underwriting as well as diversification from the merger.
Turning to slide 18. The allowance for credit losses decreased $30 million largely due to moving the $1 billion
portfolio into held for sale. Our macro assumptions include unemployment remaining fairly stable through mid-
2021 and improving thereafter and GDP recovering pre-COVID levels by late 2021. We also layer in qualitative
adjustments for COVID-related uncertainty. Continued improvement in the economic activity, less uncertainty and
stabilization of a criticized asset may prompt us to release reserves in the coming quarters.
Turning to slide 19. Our capital ratios were relatively stable, but the CET1 ratio unchanged at 10%. We declared a
common dividend of $0.45 per share and a dividend and total payout ratios of 49.4%. In December, the board
authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion of the company's common stock starting in the first quarter. Our
intention is [ph] to remain in (00:23:39) approximate 10% CET1 ratio after taking into account strategic actions,
stock repurchases, and changes in risk-weighted assets. For the first quarter, we expect to repurchase
approximately $500 million. The board authorized other measures to optimize our capital position, including the
redemption of the outstanding Series F and G preferred stock. And liquidity remained strong, and we are
prepared to meet the funding needs of our clients.
Turning to slide 20. This slide highlights our progress towards achieving the $1.6 billion in net cost saves. Our
efforts to reduce third-party spend are ahead of expectations. We are now targeting 10% reduction in sourceable
spend of $4.5 billion. In retail banking, we closed 149 branches in 2020. On a cumulative basis, we expect to
close 800 branches by the first of 2022, including more than 400 branches by the end of 2021. We also expect to
reduce our non-branch footprint by approximately 4.8 million square feet through the combination of closures and
downsizing. Through December 31, we reduced our non-branch footprint by approximately 2.4 million square feet,

so we are roughly halfway through our goal. The remaining facilities will be rationalized during 2021. Cost saves
from technology are highly dependent on core bank conversions because we can't decommission systems or data
centers until the conversions are complete. The bottom of the slide lists where we are making significant
investments. We believe these investments are critical to delivering on our purpose and providing a touch plus
technology equals trust approach to clients.
Turning to slide 21. The waterfall on the left shows how we did relative to our 2020 cost savings target. Our
objective for 2020 was to achieve annualized fourth quarter net cost saves of $640 million or 40% of the $1.6
billion target. This equates to the fourth quarter adjusted noninterest expense of $3.040 billion or less. We
adjusted noninterest expense of $3.174 billion, exceeded our target, included catch-up in expenses related to job
grading, commissions on higher revenue, and the nonqualified expenses which are substantially offset in other
income. If you exclude these items, adjusted noninterest expense would come in slightly below target. As you can
see from this slide, we are maintaining our medium-term targets and reaffirming our cost saving targets for 2021
and 2022. For 2021, our targeted fourth quarter adjusted expense would be $2.940 billion excluding acquisitions.
Now, I will provide guidance for the first quarter expressed and changes from the prior quarter. While the
environment remains fluid, we continue to see momentum in our businesses, which may enable us to outperform
the guidance. The first quarter has fewer number of days and seasonally higher personnel costs. We expect
taxable-equivalent revenue to be down 3% to 5% as a result of fewer days and purchase accounting runoff. We
expect our reported net interest margin to be down 2 to 4 basis points based on less purchase accounting
accretion and a change in the core margin. We expect core margin to be relatively stable with the exception of
increased liquidity coming from the balance sheet. This could pressure the margin up to 5 basis points.
Noninterest expense adjusted for merger costs and amortization is expected to be down 2% to 4%. We also
anticipate net charge-offs in the range of 30 to 45 basis points.
Overall, we had a strong quarter with exceptional revenue growth, good margin performance and expense
management, and strong asset quality. Now let me turn it back to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A.

Kelly S. King
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Let me just close with a few comments with regard to the Truist value proposition which is to optimize our long-
term total shareholder return, really, through a focus on strong capital, strong liquidity and diversification, and
intense client focus. We believe we can do that because we have an exceptional franchise with diverse products,
services, and markets. We are the sixth largest commercial bank in the United States. We have strong market
share and the most vibrant, fastest growing MSAs throughout the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic area. We are
uniquely positioned to deliver best-in-class efficiency and returns while we continue to invest in the future.
We are very committed, as Daryl said, to reaching our $1.6 billion of net cost savings. We have a really great mix
of complementary businesses that allows us to expand our client base through our yield-enhancing revenue
synergies. We have a very strong capital and liquidity position, as Daryl described, which positions us to be
resilient as we go through the very challenging times that we are experiencing. We are, as I said earlier, building a
best-in-class new bank who is designed to be client-focused, purpose-driven and resolutely committed to inspiring

and building better lives and communities. We believe our best days are ahead for Truist and these great United

I'll turn it back over to Ryan.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Regarding the $1.8 billion in incremental operating expenses, can you just talk about that, like,
how that number has evolved versus your original expectation? I know it's the first time you're giving us that
target. So, how does that compare to where you originally expected, and how has it evolved over time? And then,
can you give us a little bit more of your thought process behind it in terms of if we could continue to see upward
pressure on that amount, or are you pretty confident in the $1.8 billion in that it's going to remain at that target?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, John. Thanks for that question. I would tell you when we were putting the transaction together in late 2018
and announcement early 2019 that we thought $2 billion was the merger and restructuring charges and we're
pretty much on target with that. As we continue to work on all the integrations and we saw the opportunity to really
build the best-in-breed of what we could do [ph] with our systems (00:31:29) and technologies, we just knew that
we would basically be having, I would call it a lot of technology projects on steroids all at once and that this would
be a really unusual time to have all that costs running through our expense structure. So, that's really what we
came up with. And we've been tracking it to-date so far, and we feel pretty good about the forecast that we have.
We're almost at $2 billion in total when you combine both charges to both the merger and restructuring and the
incremental. So, we have about $2 billion to go over the next 1.5 years. But we believe it was for the right reasons
and makes all the sense and it's going to help our clients and really produce a good performance for our company
going forward.

So, John, a way to think about that conceptually is that $1.8 billion is really, as I think about it, like a capital
allocation for future benefits in terms of client focus and better systems and processes. So, it will flow through
expenses. We'll continue to report it to you out so you can think about it more in terms of an investment.

Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And then separately, on the branch and non-branch real estate reduction, I just
want to confirm that those reductions that you're targeting and the savings that come from that, that is included in
your targeted cost savings tied to the merger.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Absolutely. Yeah. So...

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. And...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
...and when we came up with the five buckets, we were talking about two of the buckets, I mean the retail
branches we said originally would be between 700 and 800 branches. You can see we're at the high end of that
original estimate. That will be done by the first quarter of 2022. And then on corporate real estate, even before
COVID, when you put these two companies together, we have huge duplication all throughout the Mid-Atlantic
and Southeast. So, just going through and rationalizing that space, I will tell you COVID has helped us in a
number of ways in that it's emptied out the buildings, so we can move quicker in the consolidation. And my guess
is as we continue to make these combinations that we may actually exceed what we originally estimated in
corporate real estate consolidations because of COVID and just behaviors of people working at home.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Right. That was exactly what I was getting at because I'm assuming some of the corporate real estate reduction
opportunity got bigger, you saw greater opportunity as COVID set in. So, I was just wondering if that could
present upside to your cost-saving expectations if corporate real estate reductions can be more than you thought.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yes. So, we have a plan for what we're executing now on the $4.8 billion. Once we complete that plan, I'm sure
Kelly and Bill and executive leadership will reevaluate it and see if there is opportunity to do more in the future.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. All right. Sorry about that. Yes. So, I had a couple of questions. One, just on the integrated relationship
management strategy, I'm wondering how that's progressing. The revenues are strong this quarter particularly in
fees, and so just wanted to understand how much was the IRM helping to drive that result this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Well, Betsy, that's a huge part of it. And I'll let Bill give you some deep color with regard to that. But this is a
concept of really integrating the way we focus on the client. Many institutions focus on the siloed way in terms of
products and different services. We don't do that. We focus on the whole needs of the client. And so, we've
developed this as IRM process, we call it, integrated relationship management, over really several decades. And
it's very, very effective, very efficient because everybody owns a client, everybody focus on meeting all the needs
of their client all the time. But we see a spectacular early positive feedback in terms of how it's working and
especially between the community bank and CIG. Bill, you may want to comment on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, Betsy. I mean, this is one of the really strong cultural alignments that Kelly and I talked about when we first
started talking about this merger is this commitment to put the client first and create a culture and a structure that
evolves from that. And we're seeing it. I mean, and the model's working. As Kelly noted a couple of examples in

the investment banking outperformance this quarter in particular, I mean, there was really just great contribution
from our Commercial Community Banking, from our CRE and from our private wealth businesses. So, that model
of integrated relationship management is working. It's just been great adoption, great participation, really good
cultural alignment. You see it in the insurance numbers. You see it in the wealth numbers. So, it's all part of this
structure and focus. And we have lots of discipline around it, but the key is the cultural side. [ph] There are
(00:37:25) people committed to wanting to work together and work together towards a common goal to meet
client needs. And I'd say this quarter was probably one of the better examples of how the engines are really firing
on all cylinders.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. All right. Thanks. No, appreciate that. [ph] Because the fees (00:37:43) really jumped out on the screen. I
guess, the follow-up question on the expense line here is around some of the core expense inflation outside of the
cost saves. You've got merit increases, bolt-on acquisitions, investments for revenue growth, et cetera. I'm just
wondering how investors should think about where the total expense dollars will likely land post the net cost
saves. What kind of guidance can you help us with there? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, Betsy, let me just mention, in general, we have the itemized areas you've listed. But we are really focusing on
expenses in a broader conceptual approach. And we're doing the obvious. I mean, the obvious are you got two of
these, you only need one, and those kinds of things are just kind of happening. But we're heading into a period
now where it's time for us to focus on optimization. It's time for us to focus on transformation and
reconceptualizing the business because, so far, what we've basically done, if you think about it, is put two big
banks together.
Now, what we have – and we get the big – we've got lots of savings from that, just natural overlap. But now we
have the opportunity to reconceptualize the business as we transform it post-COVID [ph] and all that's going on
with regard (00:39:00) to the new digital world. And there are enormous opportunities for us as we go through
2021. So, 2021 is going to be an intense year of focus on expenses from the perspective of transforming our
structures so that we are doing the right things in terms of investments and expense allocations to meet the
clients' needs first. And we believe that will throw off our positive benefits in terms of expenses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Betsy, what I was saying in my prepared remarks, I gave for the fourth quarter of this year the $2.940 billion. Now,
that excludes the merger and restructuring charges, the incremental MOE expenses, amortization. And then I
gave a call out on the expenses for the insurance acquisitions of about $70 million adjusted expenses. So, all that
will get carved out of that base. But when you look at, like, the job regrading, we're considering that part of the
investment. That's something that we are covering with our net saves.

Operator: And we will take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.

A
Hey, Matt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Can you talk about the timing of liquidity deployment this past quarter? Obviously, securities went up a lot. It
sounds like you had some of that. But what made you decide kind of now is the right time? We've seen the 10-
year move up, but actually mortgage rates and, I think, rates on the types of securities that you would have
bought were probably stable or down. And most people, I think, are expecting higher rates later this year. So,
what kind of drove you to deploy what seems like most of your excess liquidity this past quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, Matt, ideally, we would like to take this excess liquidity that we have and deploy it in loans. What we're seeing
is that we just have a fair amount of payoffs in the PPP. But as the businesses really come back and have a lot of
momentum and start growing as we get into the middle and later half of 2021, we really want to deploy that
excess liquidity in lending. I would say that we decided to put some of that liquidity into the investment portfolio.
We did that throughout the third quarter. We did partial hedges on them basically to help with the mark-to-market
on that.
So, when we added about $25 billion, $30 billion to the investment portfolio, we did have hedges on there of
about $20 billion that we put on to help with the market risk that we have. So, net-net, we feel good with what
we've done. The real uncertainty on a go-forward basis with all these new stimulus packages is we could get
potentially in another $10 billion or $20 billion more liquidity into the balance sheet. I think we need to evaluate
what we do with that excess liquidity, whether we keep it at the Fed or invest it or ideally lend it out, which is the
main primary objective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just circling back on the incremental costs related to the deal, obviously, you've
been incurring these already [indiscernible] (00:42:23) I think for the first time which is getting a lot of attention.
But how will we see these on the other side, right? So, like, you didn't increase the net cost saves, you haven't
really sized revenue synergies even though it certainly seems like there will be some. How will we see the
payback of that incremental $1.8 billion if you can break that out somehow?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, Matt, these, as I was describing, are really investments. So, think about these as we are building a whole new
commercial loan delivery system, a whole new mortgage loan delivery system. You will see the benefit of that in
terms of, in some cases, just more efficient systems because they're newer and the other is the effectiveness in
terms of meeting clients' needs so we can, for example, in mortgage, you can just do more mortgages because
you're more efficient. You get more mortgage applications because you have a better client experience. So, it's
just like if your car [ph] is on the rundown and runout (00:43:27) with 200,000 miles, you buy a new car, you make
an investment, you see the benefit of that in terms of driving experiences, less breakdowns, etcetera, etcetera.
So, it is an investment. That is the best way I can describe it to you to think about.

Operator: We will take our next question from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. And, Erika, your line is open.
Please check your mute button.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thank you. My first question is on revenues. Kelly, you were very upbeat on the future of this company. And
your peers were actually quite upbeat on the future of economic growth. And I'm wondering as we think about
going past the first quarter, how should we think about your base case for economic recovery relative to loan
growth which was where your peers were surprisingly upbeat and also specific to you the insurance outlook?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Erika, we are upbeat as well. I've said, and I'll take a second why I am upbeat with regard to the economy.
This economic downturn is dramatically different than what we've all experienced in the past. If you take the
[indiscernible] (00:44:52) it was about a commercial real estate bubble, 2000 was a technology bubble, 2008 was
a residential real estate bubble. There was no bubble here. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the
economy. In fact, we had 10 years of robust growth. You have ever low inflation. We just shut it off. That's
important because there were not underlying impending issues that caused the economy to sputter. Now if you
kept it shut off for 10 years, you'd have another issue. But given where we are with the vaccines, etcetera, we fully
expect that you're most likely to see a stronger snapback in the economy than most people expect.
When we talk to our clients and prospects, they are really pretty upbeat. They are saying things like it's time to get
on with it. We're ready to go. We're making investments. And we're seeing that in terms of our robust pipeline of
loan request activity. And so, we are upbeat with regard to the economy. We think it'll be slower in the first part,
picking up steam as you get through the mid-part, stimulus will help that some, but mostly businesses and
consumers feeling more confident.
Look, when the vaccines are out there, which they are, and as they become more widespread in terms of being
injected, fear goes down, confidence goes up, people are ready to live again. People are ready to invest. They're
ready to run their businesses. So, I fully expect by the time we hit towards the fall and end of the year, you're
going to be really surprised in terms of how robust this economy is. That will show up in terms of commercial loan
activity in a very big way. You'll likely to see more residential loan growth than we would have expected in a
slower economy. And, certainly, you will see it in terms of insurance activity as well. And let me just turn quickly to
Chris Henson and let him give you some color with regard to insurance because it's very important.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Bank
yeah. Thanks, Kelly. And, Erika, thank you for the question. So, I'd maybe just hit sort of fourth quarter and maybe
just the outlook to your point. One of the best quarters that we have had in some time and all the drivers of
organic growth are really kind of hitting on all cylinders. Client retention has stabilized then in retail at north of
90% for the last 8 months. Wholesale really strong at 85%. We're really seeing [ph] because of the (00:47:17)
factors in the market, standard carriers are pushing risk to the wholesale market, and we're benefiting from that.
Pricing, another element of organic growth, as strong as – we're in the hardest market we've seen in two
decades. Rates are up in the industry north of 7%. And it's anticipated that we'll continue to see some [ph]
hardening in (00:47:42) acceleration into 2021. Our new business, new business in 2019 was up in the 12% to

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
13%. That was as good as we've seen. Then we get COVID and we were kind of negative 4% to 6%. Didn't know
where the year was going to shake out. But this quarter, our new business was up 19.5%, up 8% year-to-date,
some of the best numbers I have ever seen. So, that all led to an organic growth number that we reported, 2.9%
to like quarter; 4.3% year-to-date.
But just to key in on one point Daryl made, I think it's really important. The 2.9% growth number was really
negatively impacted by a one-time MOE-related piece of insurance that was booked for our MOE deal in Q4
2019. So, if you exclude that noise, organic growth really would have been on a core basis 4.9%. In terms of
outlook, we expect first quarter commissions to be up in the 10% range. We're moving from our third best quarter
of the year to our second best and first. Obviously, uncertainties in COVID impacted the economy. But the
outlook's really strong given the accelerated pricing. Exposure units in the business are holding, would grow in
excess of surplus lines because of the shift that I mentioned [ph] and the (00:49:08) standard carriers that support
retail pushing it to E&S and we're really benefiting from that diversification.
And the pricing momentum, if you think about the markets digesting the COVID impacts, cat losses. We had 30
storms this year, the most in history in any given year and three of the, you know, largest years in history of cat
losses have occurred in the last four years. So, it's got upward pressure. And then lower interest rates which puts
pressure on investment income for underwriters. So, pricing up 7%. You're seeing examples of things like
umbrella and excess up 12.5%; D&O up 11.5%; property, which we had a lot of, up 9%, up in all classes, all
accounts.
So, looking forward, what we're expecting is – in first quarter is somewhere around the 5% kind of organic growth
rate number. And we think that elevated catastrophe level, low interest rates, all that's really going to keep it
propped up. And Kelly mentioned acquisitions. We were able to close five in the fourth quarter and we expect
more in 2021. So, really bullish about insurance going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. Thank you. That was very helpful. My second question is a two-parter on expenses. Daryl, if you could
maybe briefly describe what's in the $1.8 billion number that would assure your investors that if it doesn't linger in
the run rate? I think everybody gets scared when you see personnel as a descriptor. And going back to slide 21,
as a follow-up question to that, and a follow-up question to Betsy's question, what do we do with that [ph] 3.037
(00:50:56) that annualizes to [ph] 12.16 (00:51:00) as we think about your 2023 run rate? Is that a base for the
run rate that includes the savings plus the growth rate? Just help us think about – how to think about that number
for 2023.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, I'll start on the latter question first. So, it's pretty simple. We basically gave you guidance for fourth quarter of
2021, which was the $2.940 billion. In there, that excludes the restructuring, MOE, amortization and acquisitions.
That's it. So, that's the number we are targeting to get for fourth quarter of 2021. That's pretty simple. And then,
that will continue on in 2022 when we get all the cost savings of the net $1.6 billion.
Your other question on 2021, what was the question again on the first part?

Yeah. If you could describe the types of expenses you're incurring in that $1.8 billion merger...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's technology projects. And so, the expenses that we can carve out are onetime costs, like, when we
decommission something or something that's put out of use, from that perspective has no future benefit, that's in
the original merger and restructuring charges. But when you have developers going in and you have people going
in with systems and you have architects building out our new [indiscernible] (00:52:34) and they're basically
building a whole new Truist environment and technology.
All those are real costs. We're doing all these technology costs all at once. All that has future benefit. We would
typically not carve that out as a merger and restructuring. Because it's basically just the culmination of doing a lot
of technology projects all at once, we just thought it was fair to call out because you would never really think of
doing this all at once if it wasn't for the merger. But as Kelly said, at the end of the day, we're going to have a
much better client experience. We're going to have a much better performance overall, and you should see the
benefits of all of these systems integrated by doing the best between each of the systems that, I think, you'll have
a lot of revenue and other synergies going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Erika, keep in mind what Daryl emphasized, when you're doing these projects, you bring all those consultants in

And I'm guarding the back door.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on back book repricing dynamics and how to think about that from
here. For legacy BB&T and other banks more broadly, we saw a downward pressure on loan yields persist
throughout the last ZIRP cycle despite having a steeper curve? Can you discuss whether that downward pressure
on yields is a dynamic you'd expect to persist throughout the remainder of this ZIRP cycle as well?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Bill, I would say, in a normal balance sheet structure, that would make a fair amount of sense. What we have
going on, on our balance sheet, remember we have some purchase accounting, we have PPP and all that. We
actually saw our yield – you can see that on our tables, you can see that we actually had loan yields higher for
those various reasons. That said, I would tell you the steepening of the curve – we are asset sensitive. We're
asset sensitive across the curve, a little bit more short end than longer end. But as the yield curve shifts, we will
benefit from that. 25-basis-point steepening of the curve will basically give us 2 to 3 basis points in core margin.
So, that is a phenomenon. If you look at how things are going on and off on a pure basis, actually looked at credit
spreads going on, our commercial credit spreads are going on maybe at 3 or 4 basis points higher than what
they're coming off at. So, I think all that is relatively good from that perspective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. And let me just take the – to Daryl's point, that's also a business mix and focus issue. So, what would sort
of be traditionally a different back book look on a forward basis, as Daryl noted, I mean, we're seeing
improvement in margin that has to do with focus type of relationships value that we're adding, all those type
things. And as he noted, you see that particularly in the commercial side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Understood. That's really helpful. And just a quick follow-up on that same question. To the extent that PPP 1.0
and then 2.0 are going to be sort of contributing to the NIM in this ZIRP cycle, can you discuss how long you
would expect those tailwinds to persist through 2021 and then not 2022, or would they carry to 2022 as well?

Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Bank
Sure. Yeah, we do obviously plan to participate in round two probably in the neighborhood of $3 billion or so. We
see most of round one playing out through 2021 and round two probably coming in the first half of the year and
then rolling out the back half of the year. Really hard to call exactly when what quarter exactly that all is going to
flow out. But to answer your question, I would say 90-plus percent of it should be gone by the end of 2021.

Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. The thing I would just add to that, Bill, is that it has a huge impact obviously on core margin depending on
when the forgiveness happens. And it could be anywhere from 3 to 5 basis points, depending on the amount that
actually happens in a given quarter. One thing to note, round two is really focused on more smaller loans. So,
these actually drive higher fees like our average fee on round one was about 2.7%. Our estimate – this is just an
estimate because it's just now starting to roll out, we might be north of 5% fees on round two. And we'll have less
volume, but it will also have a huge impact when those actually are forgiven as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Bank
And just to give you a sense, we have invited 100% of round one to apply for forgiveness, but they submit
information at different times. We've received and proposed on to SBA about 40% of that to this point. So, some
of the timing is really determined by the timing of the client providing the information.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. I wonder if, Daryl, you could provide us a little more color on that commentary you
gave about the first quarter revenue outlook. I believe you said down 3% to 5% FTE. Can you help us understand
just what – Chris gave some color on insurance, but kind of the bifurcation between what you expect out of NII
and fees and what the drivers would be especially in those other fee areas in addition to insurance? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'll be happy to do that. So, when you look at margin, because we have the difference between our reported
margin and core margin, we are going to have less over time accretable yield going into our margin. Now, that's
volatile. I would say that that could be down anywhere from 2 to 4 basis points of less accretable yield that
impacts reported margin on a quarterly basis. So, that trend's down. It's just how much is down is – kind of goes
back and forth from that.
From a core margin perspective, our core margin is actually holding up really well. We've done really well this last
couple of quarters with that. The uncertainty we have is that how much more liquidity are we going to get into the
balance sheet, and liquidity into the balance sheet pressures core margin. If we decide to invest the liquidity in
securities, it gives us a little bit more NII. If you leave it at the Fed, you basically just tread water on NII. So, we
have to make those decisions as we go forward. But depending on how much liquidity we get in with the stimulus
packages, core margin could be a little bit volatile. I think you have to move to shift to net interest income and
focus on net interest income and what the impacts are until that noise gets out of there.
On the fees side, I will just tell you the business has had a lot of momentum. Insurance always is very strong. In
the first quarter, it's usually their strongest quarter. But if you look at [ph] those area in (01:00:06) investment
banking and trading, the huge pipelines they had kind of filled in the fourth quarter, if Kelly's right with the
economy, he could have a great quarter. In Joe's world in wealth, they have a lot of momentum, they're adding
new accounts. In our retail area, they have traction. Our community bank commercial actually is growing

commercial loans when you look at the detail. I don't know if Bill or Chris want to comment on the momentums we
got on revenue on those businesses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
I think you said it, Daryl. I mean, if we look at things like pipelines going forward and production in the fourth
quarter, we have a reason to be optimistic. That's against the headwind, though, of PPP pay downs and utilization
being at sort of actually uniquely low levels. So, I think the things that we can control, production pipelines are
doing well, and then I think we'll see the benefit of that over time. Whether that manifests itself in the first quarter,
second, third or fourth will be dependent upon all the things Kelly talked earlier, the confidence and market
acceptance of where we are.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Bank
Yeah. I might just add, opportunities we're seeing really for growth. Auto is very strong right now. We were up
about $1 billion in average balances. We see that continuing into the first part of the year. Mortgage warehouse
lending because of the environment also very, very strong.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Great. And just one more follow-up on that $2.940 billion number, Daryl. So, that's a – seems like to be a
real landing point that you're targeting before the $70 million – quarterly version of the $70 million of insurance
adds just to get to the base. Would that $2.940 billion also be inclusive of incentive comp or core underlying cost
inflation that's an absolute goal that you're trying to get around that number before we add the acquisitions and
other stuff?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Our hope, to be honest with you, is that our fee income is so strong and all that [ph] then I'm going to have to
(01:02:19) tell you it's meaningful and have to carve it out like we did this past quarter. That would be actually a
great story to tell you. So, we will continue to try to carve out when we think it makes sense to carve out that
variable comp. Obviously, we're a dynamic company and things are moving. But just to be sure everybody
understands, we are not changing our commitment. We are back on our way from the $1.6 billion that we made in
February 2019. We're going to get those cost savings.

Ken Usdin Q

Understood. All right. Thanks, Daryl.

Operator: And we will take our final question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Just back on the merger savings, $1.6 billion, you're reiterating that net number, that's pretty clear. But I mean,
you have 40% of the savings already and only 12% of the branch closures. You expect to exceed on the non-
branch footprint part. So, why not increase that estimate? What would it take for you to increase that estimate

$1.6 billion net? Or have you already increased the gross merger saving number, which you haven't given to us,
and reinvesting some of the proceeds? And does that all add up to positive operating leverage in 2021 or not?
You didn't quite guide for the year. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, Mike, you're right. I mean, there are many parts that move into this. And we're really just trying to anchor on
the minimum of the $1.6 billion. We're not trying to hold out what we think is possible in terms of beating that. But
some of the things I've talked about in terms of – I mean, we could have more branch closures than we've
anticipated. We're not predicting that at this moment, but that's certainly a possibility. We certainly are going to be
intensely focused on the expense optimization, and there are huge opportunities for duplication across the
enterprise, areas that we can technologically invest in and reduce ongoing expense run rate. So, the $1.6 billion
related to basically putting the two companies together.
The other things we do more in terms of transformation and additional opportunities we find whether it's a non-
branch office space, maybe we exceed that target, maybe we get a few more branches. We certainly are very
optimistic in terms – and expect to focus on doing that. We just want to be clear about what we've said we can do
and then hold out the opportunity that we can probably beat that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Without using up my second question, in terms of a gross number, I know that you're investing a lot back.
Is your gross number going higher as part of that net?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Go ahead, Daryl.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, I will tell you we are investing more than what we originally thought, Mike. But we think these are the right
investments that we're making in our people, technology, digital, all for the right reasons. So, we are making more
investments than what we originally thought. We haven't communicated that number publicly. But just know that
we are going to get our net savings, maybe we'll see that at some point but let us get the $1.6 billion first. And
right now, we are making a lot of investments in the company as we are moving forward and you're seeing it in
the results. Look at our revenues, look at our account growth that we're getting. I mean, we're doing really, really
well in the midst of a lot of conversions, which could really distract a lot of the businesses. We are performing at a
very high level.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then the second question, a lot of talk about fees, a lot of talk about insurance. So, I'm bringing in the big
guns. It's my peer colleague at my firm's insurance analyst, Elyse Greenspan. I know she's spoken with the
insurance managers at your firm before. But, Elyse, if you want to ask the question on my behalf, go ahead.

Elyse Greenspan Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. Thanks. So, the one question I had, you guys posted 5% adjusted organic growth in the fourth quarter,
which seems like a pretty impressive number relative to some of the other companies I cover and then also given
kind of the impacts that we've seen from COVID on the industry. As you guys think about 2021 from some of your
other comments, it seems like growth would continue on an organic basis, right, to kind of just come in above that
5%. If you could just maybe expand there. And then also could you give us a sense, you guys are little bit different
than others, obviously have good [ph] tales (01:07:04) of wholesale and retail in your insurance business. Has the
organic from both of those businesses, has one been outperforming versus the other or are they kind of
consistent?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Bank
Thank you for your question. This is Chris. You're right, we did finish around 5%. And based on what I see now, I
think around 5% would be certainly a good number for, call it, the first half of next year. We'll call the last half
when we get a quarter in or so. So, feel very, very good about it. But I must tell you if pricing holds, and I believe
that it will, and if the economy does begin to turn via vaccinations getting pushed out to the country and we're able
to see then better new business growth as a result, some example of what we saw this fourth quarter, could it be
better? I think it's possible that it could. So, I think the opportunity really, kind of all those cylinders have
opportunity to move. I do think the growth is going to be dependent upon what happens with COVID and economy
and kind of get all that going. But assuming we do get vaccination out midyear, stimulus first half of the year, I
think it bodes well for organic growth in that business for sure.
And your question about is the margin better in one than the other. Strategically, as a bank, the reason we want
exposure to both – if we weren't a bank, it probably wouldn't matter as much. But what we're really interested in is
for this business to provide good downside protection when credit markets are challenging. And you can see it
this year, this past year, 4.3% organic growth for the year, I think, is pretty solid given the backdrop. And the
reason we do that is because wholesale or retail are going to operate indifferent to each other. So, you're going to
– depending on whether you're in hard or soft market, one is going to help balance the other out. We're interested
in the combination of the growth there. So, certainly, a little bit better contribution from wholesale today than retail.
But they're both making nice contributions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And, ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn the
conference back to Mr. Ryan Richards for any additional or closing remarks.
