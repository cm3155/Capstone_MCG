MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Analyst and Investor Call for HSBC
Holdings Plc's Interim Results 2021. For your information, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I will
hand the call over to your host, Mr. Noel Quinn, Group Chief Executive.

Good morning in London, and good afternoon in Hong Kong. I've got Ewen with me today, and I'll hand over to
him shortly to go through the detail of our Q2 performance. First, though, I'll start with a summary of the key
highlights, our progress against our transformation plans, and in particular, what we're seeing with respect to
growth.
For the second quarter, a good operating performance, supported by a net release of expected credit losses
delivered reported pre-tax profits of $5.1 billion, up $4 billion on last year's second quarter.
We saw a return to profitability in all our regions in the first half, including good performances in both Europe and
the US. Our UK business performed well with a record quarter for mortgages in Q2. We've generated good
momentum behind our growth and transformation plans and made important decisions on exiting our mass
market retail business in the US and our retail business in France.
Our RWA and cost reduction programs are both on track. Our Asia wealth strategy is gaining traction with strong
growth in wealth balances. We're seeing promising signs of early growth in both lending volumes and fee income,

particularly in Asia. And we retained a strong capital ratio of 15.6%, which enables us to declare an interim
dividend of $0.07 per share for the first half of the year.
The next two slides look at the growth we're starting to see, particularly in Asia. In Wealth and Personal Banking,
we've already seen strong traction in our Asia wealth business, with global wealth balances up more than $250
billion or 18% in the last 12 months. This was driven chiefly by growth in assets under management rather than
deposits.
We've expanded our Asia wealth franchise, recruiting around 600 new frontline colleagues and growing affluent
and high net worth customers in Asia by 7%. While it's early days, we're seeing promising productivity data from
our Pinnacle Wealth planners in Mainland China with exciting momentum within the business. Because of that,
we're accelerating the rollout of Pinnacle to five new cities in Mainland China and planning to hire 100 more
wealth planners this year than we had originally planned.
In Commercial Banking, pipeline growth is starting to translate into lending, with $8 billion of loan volume growth
since the start of the year. Our approved lending limits in Asia are up 100% on last year's second half and 70% on
pre-pandemic levels. These include renewals, refinancing and new facilities. There are also signs of a recovery in
Asia trade with $6.7 billion of trade finance lending growth in the first half.
In Global Banking and Markets, we've made good progress repositioning the franchise for growth. The proportion
of RWAs allocated to Asia in GB&M is now 6 percentage points higher than the same point last year, with around
a third of non-Asia RWAs supporting revenue booked in Asia.
Collaboration with other businesses is a big part of the GB&M growth story, with collaboration revenue up 6%
against last year's first half. This was supported by investment in new digital market platforms, which are helping
to support our Asia wealth strategy.
Slide 4 goes deeper on the lending growth we're starting to see. We've seen strong mortgage growth globally,
with Hong Kong drawdowns up 56% year-on-year and a record quarter for UK mortgages. Card balances are
starting to recover in Hong Kong and the UK and elsewhere, up around $1 billion quarter-on-quarter.
In Commercial Banking, we're seeing improved lending limit growth translating into term lending with loans up 2%
versus the first quarter. Trade balances are up 9% and we continue to capture market share in both Hong Kong
and Singapore. We're also continuing to grow our lending pipeline in Hong Kong and Asia, which bodes well for
future quarters.
Moving to slide 5. Both our US and European businesses saw a rebound in profits and both are now well
advanced in their transformations. The US made around $0.5 billion of pre-tax profits, up from around $100
million in last year's first half. Risk-weighted assets in the US are now 16% lower than at the same point last year,
and costs are down around $100 million year-on-year.
We've announced the sale of our US mass market retail business, which is an important milestone in the
reshaping of our US portfolio. And we've also now completed the migration of fixed income derivatives trading
book from New York to London. In Europe, we delivered $1.4 billion of pre-tax profits after recording a loss in last
year's first half.

Compared with a year ago, we've reduced RWAs by 16% and costs by 3%, which includes a $149 million
increase in variable pay. We've also signed a Memorandum of Understanding to sell our French retail business.
Both our US and European businesses are much better positioned to grow than at the start of the year.
Slide 6 looks at our second pillar, digitize at scale. Our technology spending is now 18% higher than the same
period in 2018 and 4% higher than last year's first half. This is making us a better and stronger bank, both
operationally and in terms of the customer experience and providing material operating leverage, as we grow the
business.
The proportion of payments that go straight through without manual intervention now stands at 96.7%. We're
reducing account opening times. For example, including first direct, where it now takes 10 minutes to open an
account, instead of 10 days. And we've introduced e-signature for over 200 processes in Hong Kong, substantially
reducing, both processing time and the use of physical forms. We're launching and scaling new digital products.
Our multi-currency Global Money Account launched last year in the US and is now live in both Singapore and the
UAE. We've launched Kinetic in the UK, which already has more than 10,000 users, and a 4.8 app store rating.
And we're simplifying and automating trade finance. By 2023, our digital trade transformation aims to reduce 60
bespoke systems down to just 5. Clients and counterparties can already agree the wording of guarantees digitally,
which is then fulfilled seamlessly in our back office, significantly reducing both time and effort.
In supply chain finance, we can now digitally onboard suppliers in two days rather than eight, helping clients to
support their suppliers and increase the resilience of their supply chains. These are big innovations with a real-
world impact for our customers.
Slide 7 looks at energize for growth, our third pillar. Our move to hybrid working is now well-underway with a 10%
reduction in our global office footprint since the start of 2020.
Three of our global business CEOs, are in the process of relocating to Asia. And we made a number of key
leadership appointments in Asia, in the first half of the year. We're aiming to build a more diverse business. We've
signed up to the WEF's partnership for Racial Justice in Business and the UN LGBTI Standards of Conduct for
Business.
We've also increased the proportion of female leaders to more than 31%. But we've still much more to do. And
we've hired more than 650 new graduates from 48 different countries, more than half of whom are female.
Slide 8 looks at our final pillar, the transition to net zero. I was delighted and grateful, that 99.7% of our
shareholders backed our special resolution on climate change at our AGM in May. That was a strong
endorsement of our climate strategy, which has, at its core, a commitment to support our customers on their
transition to low carbon. We're continuing to provide strong support to our customers on their transition journeys,
taking part in more sustainable financing in the first half of 2021, than in the whole of 2020.
We're working closely with our own suppliers to help them improve their climate reporting, so that we can become
net zero, in our operations and supply chain by 2030. And we're building partnerships to unlock new climate
solutions and make them investable. Joining forces with WWF and the World Resources Institute to bring new
projects and technologies into commercial scale. Overall, it's still relatively early in the life of our growth and
transformation plans, but I'm pleased with our progress so far.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 02-Aug-2021
Ewen will now take you through our results and update you on our targets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Noel and good morning and afternoon all. We had another solid quarter. Reported pre-tax profits of $5.1
billion, that's up almost fivefold on last year's second quarter with an annualized return on tangible equity of 9.4%
for the first half. Adjusted revenues were down 10% on last year's second quarter, due largely to the impact of the
current rate environment, together with the comparison against a very strong global market second quarter last
year.
Importantly, we think we're now close to the trough in year-on-year revenues with volume growth in our lending
businesses and our wealth franchises driving a recovery in the coming quarters. Expected credit losses were
$284 million net release, second quarter in a row of net releases. This reflects a continued improvement in the
economic outlook for our Central scenarios, less extreme downside scenarios, given the progress in global
vaccinations and exceptionally low Stage 3 charges in both the first and second quarters. We still retain $2.4
billion of the Stage 1 and 2 ECL reserve buildup we made in 2020.
Operating expenses were up 4%. This was due to both higher performance-related pay accrual and higher
technology spend. Despite this, we remain on track to deliver our target of broadly stable operating cost for the
year ex the bank levy, subject, of course, to final decisions on the variable pay pool later in the year.
Lending and deposit balances were up 2% and 1%, respectively, as lending growth spread for us beyond
mortgages and retail banking and trade finance and commercial banking, with increased confidence in higher loan
growth in the second half of the year. Our core Tier 1 ratio was down nearly 30 basis points at 15.6%, due
primarily to our dividend accrual.
Our tangible net asset value per share of $7.81 was up $0.03 on the first quarter, and we've declared an interim
dividend of $0.07 per share for the first half of the year. We remain on track to deliver all of our medium-term
targets, including rebuilding to a return on tangible equity of at least 10%.
Turning to slide 10, we're continuing to shift the balance of the group's focus towards Asia through capital
reallocation and the buildup of capabilities and people. However, as other regions start to recover from COVID-19
lows, we're also seeing much improved earnings diversity with profitability in all regions during the half.
Europe has gone from loss-making in last year's first half to generating 22% of group profits in the first half of this
year. This included a strong contribution from our UK ring-fenced bank, which saw a revenue growth of 12% in
Wealth and Personal Banking and 7% in Commercial Banking. There are also good signs of recovery elsewhere,
including the Middle East, the US and Mexico.
We're also now seeing more balanced profitability across our global businesses. Each business now generating
roughly a third of group profits in the first half, with a particularly strong recovery in Commercial Banking.
Turning to slide 11 and looking at the second quarter adjusted revenues across the three global businesses. In
Wealth and Personal Banking, revenues were down 4% on a year ago. Wealth Management revenues grew by
$187 million due mainly to an increase in the value of new business written in insurance and mutual fund sales
growth in Hong Kong.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 02-Aug-2021
Personal Banking revenues fell by $161 million due to the impact of low interest rates on deposit margins.
Commercial Banking revenues were 4% lower due mainly to the impact of low interest rates on global liquidity
and cash management, but with good growth in trade balances in the quarter and early signs of growth across
other commercial lending.
In Global Banking and Markets, revenues were down 23%. This was largely due to slower customer activity and
lower volatility in the fixed income markets, as compared with a particularly strong global markets performance in
the same period last year.
On slide 12, net interest income was $6.6 billion, down 5% against the second quarter of 2020 on a reported
basis, but stable compared with the first quarter of 2021. On rates, the net interest margin was 120 basis points,
down 1 basis point on the first quarter, primarily reflecting lower asset yields, which more than offset lower funding
costs.
On volumes, we saw a continued good loan growth in mortgages in Hong Kong and the UK and strong
commercial applications that have started to translate into drawdowns. For the remainder of the year, we're
seeing signs that net interest income has now stabilized, and we expect loan growth to support net interest
income in the second half.
On the next slide, non-interest income was $5.9 billion, down 11% against last year's second quarter due to the
exceptionally strong global markets performance in the second quarter last year. However, we saw good fee
income progression in all our businesses against last year's second quarter, with strong performances in Wealth,
Global Liquidity and Cash Management, and Capital Markets and Advisory.
We expect customer activity and fee income to continue to strengthen, as economic activity recovers, although
the recovery path obviously remains uncertain as a result of COVID-19 variants.
On the next slide, we reported a net release of $284 million of expected credit losses in the quarter compared with
a $4.2 billion charge in the second quarter of 2020. The net release was across all global businesses. This
reflected an improved economic outlook, together with Stage 3 charges that remained very low in the quarter.
Recognizing that the risks that still exist from the pandemic, we're continuing to hold around $2.4 billion of our
2020 COVID-19 uplift to Stage 1 and 2 ECL reserves. Based on the current economic outlook, we now expect the
ECL charge for the full year to be materially lower than our medium-term through-the-cycle planning range of 30
to 40 basis points, with the potential even for a net release for full year 2021 and further Stage 1 and 2 releases in
the first half of 2022.
Turning to slide 15, second quarter adjusted operating costs were $297 million higher than the same period last
year. This was driven by higher performance-related pay accrual of $367 million and a $204 million increase in
technology investment. We made a further $484 million of cost program savings compared with the prior year with
an associated cost to achieve of $499 million.
To-date, our cost programs, have achieved savings of $2 billion relative to our year-end 2022 target of $5 billion
to $5.5 billion with cumulated cost to achieve spend of $2.7 billion. Despite higher second quarter costs, we
continue to expect our 2021 adjusted operating costs, excluding the benefit from a reduced bank levy to be
broadly in line with 2020.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 02-Aug-2021
Turning to capital on slide 16, our core Tier 1 ratio was 15.6%, down 27 basis points in the quarter. This reflected
an increase in RWAs from lending growth, including a short-term increase of around $10 billion from IPO loans in
Hong Kong, together with a decrease in capital, including a $3.5 billion accrual for dividends.
As signaled at the time of our first quarter results, we will include a deduction each quarter for dividend accruals.
For the half year, that deduction was $0.17 based on 47.5% of our first half EPS of $0.36, which is the midpoint of
our 40% to 55% target payout ratio.
To reiterate my comments from last quarter, it shouldn't be read as a signal or a forecast of our 2021 dividend
intentions. The dividend accrual is purely a formulaic calculation that will true up at the full year based on the
results and outlook at the time. Reflecting the current improved economic outlook and improved operating
environment in many of our markets, we now expect to move to our target payout range in 2021. We've retained
the flexibility to adjust earnings per share for non-cash significant items. And in 2022, we also intend to exclude
the losses on the sale of our French retail banking operations.
When thinking about the payout ratio for 2021, we'll attach a lower weight to unusually low ECL charges or credits
as part of this year's earnings per share, together with a desire to see further progress from 2021 in dividends per
share in 2022 and beyond.
Excluding FX movements, risk-weighted assets rose by $13.5 billion in the second quarter driven by growth in
Asia and the IPO loans I already mentioned, we now expect low-single-digit percentage growth in risk-weighted
assets for the full year.
On the next slide, due to changes in the underlying calculation methodology, we've updated our risk-weighted
asset savings targets on a like-for-like basis from $100 billion to $110 billion. So far, we've made around $85
billion of transformation saves and remain fully on track to meet our target.
On slide 18, it's still early days in terms of our 2022 targets, but we've made good progress so far. We're on track
to meet our cost and risk-weighted asset savings targets, and we remain confident that we're on track for a return
on tangible equity at or above 10% over the medium term.
The shift to higher return areas is underway. And we're starting to see results from the growth opportunities we've
identified.
As mentioned, we now intend to move to our target payout ratio in 2021. As a reminder, our dividend policy aims
to deliver sustainable cash dividends, while retaining the flexibility to invest and growing the business in the
future, supplemented by additional shareholder distributions, if appropriate.
So in summary, this was another solid quarter for us, a near fivefold increase in pre-tax profits on the same period
last year, with good earnings diversity across the group and evidence of strong execution in all areas of strategy.
While the results were materially flattered by a net release of ECLs, we can see early signs of a broadening
recovery in lending with volume growth translating into revenue growth, as our net interest margin stabilizes and
growth in fee income across our businesses.
Despite uncertainty on the pace of recovery from here, we remain on track with all of our medium-term targets,
and with that, our ability to achieve cost of capital returns and to fund attractive growth.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 02-Aug-2021
With that, Sharon, if we could please open up for questions.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you Mr. Stevenson. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Martin Leitgeb
from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin Leitgeb Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
Yes. Good morning. And thank you for the presentation and for taking my questions. If I can just start with
comments you made on the risk of cost outlook, in particular as we head into 2022. Given the current economic
outlook that there'd be a scenario that risk costs could also undershoot the 30 to 40 basis points, kind of for the
cycle range, as we head into 2022 just considering the management overlay still in place.
And related to that, I was just wondering in terms of how we should think of scope for capital return. I know there
are comments in the presentation about the potential for a step-up in capital return. I think the dividend guidance
is clear. How should we think about the scope for potential buyback? Is that becoming simply a possibility in
particularly as we head into 2022? And is that a key instrument in terms of how we should think about getting the
core Tier 1 ratio back to a level of 14% to 14.5%, which is the target range. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Ewen, do you want to handle both of those?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Thanks, Martin. So on ECLs in 2022, I do think that we're going to continue to – I talked about earlier of
having $2.4 billion of Stage 1 and Stage 2 reserves that we built up from last year is still in place. That's around
60% of the reserve buildup we put in place last year. We do think that, that will unwind or to the extent that, that
unwinds, it will unwind over probably the following four quarters. So there will be some benefit into the first half of
2022. I don't think that, we'll begin to normalize on expected credit losses at this point until the second half of
2022.
On capital distributions, and I'll give a slightly fuller answer given I'm sure that there will be several questions
around this. Look, relative to the comments I made at the start of the year around our capital position and capital
distributions, I think sitting today, we are in a stronger position relative to what we thought. We've seen a much
improved credit outlook. It's our second quarter of reserve releases and an expectation that we're going to
continue to see additional releases over the coming four quarters.
We've also had much lower credit rating migration than what we thought, leading to lower risk-weighted asset
growth relative to what we thought a few months ago. So our core Tier 1 ratio today is stronger than where we
thought we'd be and the outlook is better.
We know that we've got some know and knowns in terms of capital headwinds. Software intangibles, which is
around 25 basis points of benefit we expect to get removed from the beginning of 2022. If you look in
combination, I think there's roundabout 10 basis points of aggregate hit from the sales of our French and US retail

banking franchises that will impact us into 2022 and 2023. And we've got various regulatory-driven uplifts of
roundabout $40 billion uplift in risk-weighted assets over the next 18 months.
But equally, we know that we've just accrued under our accrual policy $0.17 of dividend versus the $0.07 that
we've just declared. And we've still got at least $25 billion of RWA reductions in our RWA rundown program.
Yeah, we are committed to paying a sustainable and healthy dividend, while continuing to progressively normalize
our core Tier 1 capital position over the next 18 months.
Buybacks will be one way for us to think about normalizing and using our surplus capital, and we'll continue to
keep buybacks under review in the coming quarters. And I would note that, that tonality is different to what we've
said in previous quarters. As you recall, at full year, we said that we wouldn't contemplate buybacks this year.
We're now saying that we'll keep it under review.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Raul Sinha from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Raul.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Hi, good morning, everybody. A couple of questions from my side as well. Perhaps one just to follow up, Ewen, on
your comments. How will you define surplus capital for HSBC? Because I'm consciously talking about potential for
growth opportunity after a very long period of time, coming back onto the table. And obviously, you do have a very
strong capital position with buybacks – with write-backs to come, but also potential to deploy that capital.
So it's quite difficult from the outside to understand how much might be structurally excess surplus capital
[indiscernible] (00:30:21) thoughts on how we could go about doing that, that would be helpful.
The second one is just to come back to the comment around NII stabilization. And if I look at some of the moving
parts within that, the Asia Pac down 3 basis points in the quarter, again, the UK business down 3 basis points and
quite a few of your UK peers are talking about NIM pressure to come.
And there's $9 billion or so of IPO funding in here in Q2 as well. So I'm just trying to understand what gives you
the confidence that NII has finally stabilized. Is that more driven by the fact that you're seeing this card balance
pick up or, Ewen, do you think that's probably likely to be NIM accretive sort of loan growth coming down the
pipe? Or is there something in Q2 trends, that perhaps was creating the pressures? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yes. So on, yes, use of capital firstly, obviously, we've got organic growth. I think we're still sitting – sticking to our
target of mid single-digit loan growth over the next coming quarters into 2022. And I'll come back to that in terms
9

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 02-Aug-2021
of where we're seeing that growth. We also have been public about the fact that we are thinking about a number
of small bolt-on acquisitions, which are almost exclusively centered on the Asian wealth space.
And I would use the word bolt-on quite carefully. We are not looking at anything material. But in aggregate, we are
looking at three or four opportunities in the wealth space across Asia at the moment. Yeah, I think our distribution
policy, as it relates to dividends, is very clear, the 40% to 55% payout range.
As I said, for this year, I think you should expect us to be at the lower end of that range because of the unusual
benefit that we all have had from ECLs this year. And then on top of that – buybacks on top of that. So I think you
can sort of do the math and know what we're solving for. The only thing that you won't have on that is the bolt-on
acquisitions. But if you think of three or four smaller bolt-on acquisitions of, say, $0.5 billion each will help in
relation to that math.
Net interest income stabilization, I think we are – we've seen HIBOR now broadly stabilize. If I look at second
quarter of this year, the average one-month HIBOR rate was 9 basis points. I think in Q3 so far, it's been around 8
basis points. So we are troughing now.
I think if you look at the underlying growth, we had about $16 billion of loan growth in the second quarter. You can
take about $9 billion of that away for the Hong Kong IPO loans, you can add back $3 billion because we shifted
the US portfolio that we're selling into held for sale. And there was probably up to $5 billion of GBM runoff, Global
Banking and Markets runoff, in the loan portfolio, particularly in the non-ring-fenced bank.
So we think we grew the underlying loan portfolio by about $10 billion to $15 billion, which is about 1% to 1.5%
growth in the quarter, which is 4% to 6% growth for the full year, which is very much in that run rate that I talked
about.
Yeah, you're right that there may be some still some modest income pressure in the UK. But I think you saw this
quarter in the UK, lending growth more than offset any decline in net interest margin, and we continue to remain
confident about our ability to grow faster than peers in the UK, particularly, in mortgages.

Yes. Good morning. Good morning, Ewen. Good morning, Noel. I was really going to push you a bit more on the
dividend policy. I think you've kind of explained it, I think, fairly well now. But obviously, if we see a big increase in
– I think the consensus payout, I think, this year is 50%, because it sounds like you're going to see earnings beat

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 02-Aug-2021
because of the very low impairment number and therefore, you're going to let the payout ratio go down towards
the bottom.
And I guess as things normalize, the payout goes back up again. I mean this is just not really just saying you've
got a progressive dividend policy. I'm just wondering do you actually need this target payout range. What sort of
purposes that serve now? Or should we just be thinking you're looking to maintain a progressive dividend that you
can increase each year.
And secondly, I was going to also focus a little bit on the NII guidance and whether that – the fact you're not
specifically talking about NIM [indiscernible] (00:35:59) you are expecting now more NIM pressure, and it sounds
like you are – but again, I wonder if you could talk to that relating to signs of maybe slower growth in Asia? Maybe
it's going to take longer for interest rates to normalize than we thought only a month or two ago. I wondered if you
could just talk to that as well, please. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. First around dividend policy, I don't think we've said that we have a progressive dividend policy. We've said
that we've got a 40% to 55% payout. I think, obviously, we're conscious of the market's desire to have a
progressive dividend policy, but it's not an official part of our policy.
So we would expect, having said that, that we would ideally like 2022 dividends to be higher than 2021 dividends.
So, in the first half of this year, again, we accrued $0.17 versus the $0.07 we declared. We had an EPS of $0.36
in the first six months, and we've paid out $0.07, so we've paid out just under 20% of our earnings in the first half.
So, mathematically, we do expect a more substantial payout in the second half of this year. And we would
anticipate that 2022 dividends should be higher than 2021 dividends without committing to a progressive dividend
policy.
On net interest income, I don't think we're going to see in aggregate much NIM pressure from here, equally I'm
sort of [ph] loathed (00:37:38) to call the bottom in NIM and you know I hate forecasting it for you. But I do think
the combination – that if any relative NIM pressure from here, coupled with stronger loan growth, means that we
are close to getting back into a cycle now of seeing net interest income grow. And I think certainly by the time we
get into 2022, we'll definitely see net interest income grow, given NIM will definitely have, I think, stabilized by
then.
And on rates, again, relative to where we were six months ago, where our planning position was that we are
unlikely to see any policy rate rises probably until the very back end of 2023 or more certainly 2024, I think we're
much more enthusiastic now that we may begin to see policy rates rising led by the UK from sort of mid-2022
onwards, and certainly, 2023 benefiting materially from higher policy rates.

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And Tom, if I could just add a couple of comments on the NIM. Generally, we're seeing the volume growth, the
new deal activity being transacted good NIMs, good margins, we're not having to trade margin to get that volume
growth.
There is one area, where there is a lot of activity, and that's UK mortgages. But even there, the margins we're
generating on UK mortgages are above the back book margins, albeit slightly lower today than they would have
11

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 02-Aug-2021
been three or six months ago, but they're still well above the back book margins. So we're not seeing a trade-off
on margin for new business relative to volume, in any significant degree.
And then, on dividend policy, I just want to remind you, we put the dividend payout ratio 40% to 55%, because we
wanted to get the balance right between distributing capital to generate a decent return for our investors but also
retaining sufficient capital to fund future growth and future opportunities.
Now to the extent that those future growth opportunities are not there either organically or inorganically, then we'll
consider buybacks or capital return. But if we do see growth, then we have the ability to fund that growth, through
retention of capital.
And our previous policy probably didn't get that balance right. We were too much into distribution and not enough
in to fund in future growth.

Hi Omar.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Omar Keenan Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. So I just had a question on the, Asia wealth
management strategy. Just bearing in mind that, you're looking at a couple of bolt-on opportunities, when you look
at the HSBC Wealth Management offering in Asia, where do you think might be a particular geographic or product
gaps that you might be looking to fill in?
And secondly, just I had a question on the UK business and mortgage growth, which strategically is looking to
take market share. I was wondering if, there's been any thoughts around perhaps pursuing inorganic strategies
there as well. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. Thanks, Omar. I'll take certainly, the first one, on wealth bolt-ons, we're clearly looking at Pan Asia. We
believe we have good organic growth opportunities with the platform we have in Hong Kong. And therefore, that
would be the primary focus, I think in Hong Kong would be primarily organic growth in Hong Kong. We're
organically investing in China to grow our wealth business there. And we've given you the plans for that, recruiting
an additional 3,000 people over the medium-term with already 600 done in the first -n up until the half – first half
this year. If you're looking at, therefore, where the bolt-ons are likely to be, they're likely to be rest of Asia.
In terms of capabilities, we're looking at both product and distribution capabilities to accelerate our organic growth
plans there. We're willing to invest organically in the rest of Asia. But if we can find some bolt-on acquisitions that
12


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 02-Aug-2021
can accelerate those organic investment plans, that would be helpful. We are looking at three to four as we
speak, and they are a combination of products and distribution capabilities being acquired in areas such as
insurance, high net worth wealth management and asset management. So those would be the primary areas of
focus.
On mortgage growth, just – Ewen, can fill you in a bit more on that. But just for clarity, our share of mortgages in
the UK was below our natural footprint share of customers in the UK. And what we're doing is rebuilding to a more
natural mortgage market share to match the market share of customers we have in the UK and the banking
market. So yes, we're taking market share from others, but it's to rebuild to where we believe we should be more
naturally positioned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And maybe just to add a few more comments to what Noel said. If you look at our current account market share
by value, and we've got a more affluent customer base, yeah, we have about a 13% to 14% share of current
accounts. Our stock share is currently 7.4% of mortgages. We are and have been consistently growing our flow
share in excess of stock share.
We grew flow share around 8.5%, 8.6% in the quarter, yeah, about 100 basis points higher than our stock share.
And why are we able to do that? Partly is because, if you went back a few years, we didn't have established
broker distribution which, as you know, is around 70% of the market in terms of distribution.
Over the last few years, we've fully built out broker distribution and we're sitting on a lot of excess liquidity in the
UK business, which went up even further during COVID. We think the returns on new business, highly attractive.
So I think you should expect us to continue to target higher growth in the mortgage market, if we can continue to
take share of the type of margins that we are currently seeing.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Good morning, Ewen. Yeah. Just one quick follow-up on mortgages, if I may. Just around your RoTE. I mean is
there any chance that you could give us an indication of what kind of ROE you're booking on mortgages as you
currently observe it now? And then just around GB&M, if I could ask around your expectations for the full year in
that business. And I know FICC was kind of down a decent chunk in Q2. I mean, how much of that do you think is
down to normalizing markets versus restructuring? And do you think we can continue to expect any, kind of,
revenue attrition from restructuring this year in that business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Look, on mortgages, we're not going to go into the detail, but we're earning returns on capital materially
above our cost of capital, yeah, partly because, as you know, UK mortgage risk weights are very low and we've
got plenty of excess funding. So that is very accretive business for us.
On Global Banking and Markets, I think, we've said previously that we expect 2021 to be down on 2020, but
above 2019. I think that continues to be our position. As you know, the whole Street had a particularly weak
quarter in fixed income, partly because of the strength of fixed income a year ago. And we do think that there are
some lines in that fixed income business that are important to us like FX that will naturally recover as customer
activity recovers, both on the commercial side and the retail side out of COVID.
Equities for us actually had a really good quarter, they outperformed peers, but it's a relatively small part of our
overall Global Banking and Markets franchise. And Capital Markets and Advisory, remember, we are weaker than
some peers in the US, and we have stayed out of SPAC financings, which has been a big driver of some of the
profitability of some of the peers. But overall, when we've done the comparison versus peers, we didn't see
anything in there that -other than sort of in the pack for fixed income and outperforming in equities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
And Ewen can I just ask – a quick follow-up on the mortgages. I mean, there is set to be quite a lot of regulatory
RWA inflation coming down the pipe in the next 12 to 18 months. I mean do you have any sense as to whether
that might provide a floor to any of the pricing at a system level? Or do you think the system is already pricing
basically adjusting for this RWA inflation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. I mean, well, we are certainly thinking about that RWA uplift. I think in aggregate, I think the 10% floor at
the portfolio level adds about $3 billion of RWA uplift for us, which is not material in the overall context of our UK
14


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 02-Aug-2021
mortgage business. But inevitably, if RWA floors by or output floors by way down the track then pricing will adjust
accordingly, I think.

line is open.

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Andy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Coombs Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Good morning. One on costs and then one on wealth, please. Just firstly on costs, you flagged the step-up in
variable pay this quarter. But your full year cost guidance is unchanged. So just trying to understand, that's just
the timing issue in the variable pay or whether the mix of the costs in your full year guidance is perhaps slightly
different to what you first thought? That would be the first question.
Second question, wealth. If I look at life insurance manufacturing, investment distribution, the life insurance
manufacturing number obviously has some benefits from market movement that makes up quite a big chunk of
the revenue contribution in this quarter. If we were to strip that out, do you think that's a more normalized base
level this quarter? Obviously, you've still got the offshore sales to come back, perhaps you could just comment,
both on whether investment distribution and life insurance manufacturing adjusted, is a more normalized quarter
and a fair base to [indiscernible] (00:50:41)? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Look, on costs for this year, I think there is a mix change going on of a few hundred million. Not all of that
increase in variable pay is a sort of timing issue. Some of it is an increase in the variable pay accrual relative to
what we thought.
But yeah, the mix shift, I think, Andy, is because we had anticipated in the second half that there were various line
items that we would begin to see a return to normalization from COVID that we think is going to be much slower
than what we previously anticipated.
So generally, yeah, costs associated with running the bank like travel, printing, office premises and the like, I
think, are going to run a few hundred million lower than what we previously anticipated for this year, which offsets
a slightly higher accrual into the variable pay for. So that's why we're sort of still confident in committing to the flat
cost target.
On wealth, I think, yeah, you have to bifurcate between the domestic Hong Kong business and what you see
there is – actually, the Hong Kong business is doing okay and better than in previous quarters, Andy. Effectively,
the international business, particularly the Mainland China business, which continues to be significantly impacted
because of the closure of the border, we don't expect that border to reopen until Q4 at the earliest.
15


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 02-Aug-2021
So, I wouldn't describe this quarter as a normalized quarter for insurance. I would describe it as normalized
probably for the Hong Kong business and continuing to be abnormally low for the China business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Coombs Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
And just on the cost – sorry, a quick, quick follow-up. If you're saying the T&E has basically been delayed, and
that's the offset. Presumably you do expect the T&E to come back in 2022. So, is the hope that, that variable
comp, may also reverse slightly at that point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
No. I mean, look, I mean, I think I would describe it as sort of margin for error in 2022 has tightened because of
that pay pressure that we're seeing relative to what we previously thought. You're right that those COVID-related
savings should get back to more normal levels or what we describe as more normal levels than 2022 onwards.
But remember also, I think embedded in that is, it's new normal versus old normal. For example, we've reduced
our travel budget. If you looked in 2019, we were spending about $400 million a year. We have taken that down to
a run rate of $200 million a year for planning purposes going forward from 2022 onwards.
Yeah, we've talked about the big savings that we see in head office expenses getting out of 40% of our own real
estate ex branches over the next few years, which will reduce that part of our cost structure by just over 20%. But
you're right that those numbers were already embedded into our full year 2022 cost target. So the other thing, just
– again, just for all of you, our cost target was based on constant FX. So what was $31 billion today is about
$31.5 billion of costs for 2022.

Guy Stebbings Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Hi. Good morning, Noel and Ewen. Thanks for taking questions. Just a couple of follow-ups, the first one was on
margin. Mix has been diluted and then given the strength in secured, I just wondered, when you think about your
loan growth and the 1% to 1.5% quarterly underlying growth. And that had been consistent with your expectations
going forward. Within that, we should be assuming it's still going to be tilted slightly more towards secured. We
can then obviously keep an eye on rates and other factors when it comes to adjustment on NIM, but just helpful to
think about how much of that loan growth just to flow through into NII growth.
And then, just going back to distributions and timing. Your 15.6% now RWA growth in the second half, it looks like
your guidance of $10 billion to $20 billion, sort of 20, 30 basis points capital growth, given the cost should be
much lower in the second half and [ph] this certainly suffice (00:55:41) to the upside.
16


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 02-Aug-2021
So it feels like capital shouldn't move an awful lot in the second half, even pro forma for the accrual. If that's
broadly correct and you sat there with 100 to 150 basis points of headwind to the target coming into the year, can
we take your comments around buybacks being a bit [indiscernible] (00:56:00) in sort of next six months
depending on bolt-ons? Is that fair? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay, if I could just quickly take the new business comment. We're not expecting a significant change in our mix
between secured and unsecured. I think we see the portfolio having a similar balance to history. So we're not re-
weighting that portfolio mix. As you know, we tend to be more of a secured book than an unsecured book. We do
have a credit card business. We do have unsecured lending.
But in our wealth business, we have a strong mortgage book. And in our Commercial Banking and Wholesale
business, it tends to be secured. So we don't see a significant change. Do you want to take the second question,
Ewen?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So I'm not going to sort of comment on your maths in terms of where our core Tier 1 ratio may be at the
end of the year. But I think we would be slightly more cautious than you in saying that we expect it to be in line
with where we currently are, partly, I think, because we are anticipating decent RWA growth in the second half of
the year.
But yeah overall, in terms of – yeah, the main comment in relation to buybacks is, I mean, if you recall at the full
year results back in February, I said definitely no buybacks this year. We softened that language slightly at Q1.
We're softening it again now. And we will definitely keep it under review. And we're not – we are no longer calling
out that there's an absolute ban on buybacks this year. So we'll keep it under review.

Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Good morning everyone. I wanted to just follow up on the comments on insurance, please. You were talking
about the offshore sales coming back, hopefully, from Q4 onwards. I mean previously, offshore insurance sales in
Hong Kong made up about 40% of total sales for that business. Do you think we can get back to that kind of level
quite quickly once the border reopens? And do you think there might even be a catch-up of the lost business from
the last couple of years coming through, setting you up for a very strong 2022, if the border reopens?
And secondly, and somewhat related, I wondered if you could give us any indication of how you think IFRS 17 will
impact the business? Or if you can't indicate how it will impact the business, can you tell us when you will give us
some indication of how it impacts the business? Thank you.

I think on the insurance, I mean, it's very hard to predict life after COVID relative to life before COVID because
there are so many things that are changing, but we would expect to rebound. But also, you've got to be cognizant
of the fact we're investing in the Greater Bay Area. We're investing in Pinnacle. We're investing in our insurance
capabilities and wealth management capabilities onshore. So we believe we'll be well-positioned, whether it
comes back into Hong Kong or it stays in Hong Kong – sorry, it stays in the Greater Bay Area, we'll have the
ability to serve both markets.

Ewen James Stevenson A

Yeah. And then the question on IFRS 17, Manus. Look, we're conscious of the fact that we owe the market an
answer on this and some guidance around this. I think, certainly, in the next couple of quarters, no later than full
year results, we'll give a kitchen on what we think the impact of IFRS 17 is. But yeah, broadly, as you know,
reported earnings will be lower, materially lower than current reported earnings for the insurance business.
