Thanks, Dorothy. Good morning. I hope this call finds all of you and your families safe and healthy. We are
pleased with our third quarter results as we made significant progress on client deferrals; we improved our
operating leverage and grew the loan portfolio; and ended the quarter with a robust commercial pipeline.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2020
We remain committed to focus on the health and safety of our team members, clients and communities. We are
currently occupying about 50% of our office buildings by rotating team members every four weeks. Our branch
lobbies are open, and we are active in our communities. Many larger banks have told their relationship managers
to stay home and not worry about goals this year. By contrast, our relationship managers are proactively serving
existing clients and winning new relationships, rather than being distracted or derailed by COVID.
Jim Sandgren and I have also been actively calling our new client opportunities to help win business. I've been
impressed by the quality of the new relationships we've been able to win this quarter, many of them moving from
long-term relationships from other larger banks. I would like to thank our team members for their hard work and
dedication.
Starting on slide 3, our third quarter net income was $77.9 million or $0.47 per share. I was particularly pleased
with our progress on operating leverage and strong balance sheet growth. Growing our balance sheet and
watching our cost should help us mitigate the near-zero interest rate environment. While we did not take a
provision this quarter, we did grow the reserve, given our net recoveries for the quarter. Brendon will fill you in on
all the details with respect to our reserve.
End of period commercial loans increased by 10.5% annualized, primarily due to the record commercial
production. Our commercial production was $978 million, up from $658 million in the second quarter. Line
utilization was about the same. Core deposits were higher by 7% on annualized basis, driven by continued growth
in noninterest-bearing deposits. Net interest income was unchanged, but the margin was lower from the effect of
new business yields. Mortgage and capital markets revenue continued to be exceptionally strong and offset
COVID-related lower deposit service charges.
We continue to achieve lower expenses as we execute on our ONB Way initiatives. Our adjusted efficiency ratio
for the quarter was 53%. Year-over-year operating leverage were improved by almost 300 basis points. When we
introduced The ONB Way, I told you I was more excited about the revenue initiatives than the cost initiatives.
Many of these revenue initiatives have been delayed because of the pandemic, but we are now making progress
on building systems and hiring talent to support these initiatives.
I'm excited about the team members we've already hired and the ones we have in the pipeline. We have a great
story to tell. And we have strong interest from senior relationship managers from other larger institutions. We have
hired and expect to hire more in wealth management, private banking, commercial, treasury management and
key support team members in IT and digital marketing. These hires will put near-term pressure on personnel
costs over the next few quarters, but will ultimately lead to higher revenue from these growth initiatives.
Most of our reported credit quality metrics are relatively unchanged during the quarter, but we expect that credit
metrics will ultimately worsen, and losses will materialize, once the stimulus and deferral programs run their
course. We proactively downgraded some of our most vulnerable loans into the Watch asset quality ratings and
are meeting weekly to review credit quality loan-by-loan.
We still don't know when losses will meaningfully materialize, but we suspect sometime in the first half of next
year, depending on additional government stimulus programs. We believe our historically strong underwriting
practices, our diverse and granular loan portfolios and Midwest footprint should help us weather the impact better
than most. We continue to share with our Board of Directors multiple economic forecasts and various stress tests.
As a result, we don't anticipate any capital actions and we expect to maintain our current dividend.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2020
On last quarter's call, I stated we are open for business and are extending new credit. Old National has always
managed with a long-term view. We will continue to make new loans if we're comfortable with the underlying cash
flow structure and pricing. The loans we are booking today are generally with better structures than we would
have accepted last year. We do not jump into businesses or sectors during the good times only to exit during the
tough times. Our balance sheet and capital remain strong, our markets are diversed and our experienced team
will help us manage this uncertain time.
Speaking of experience, I will turn the call over to our 41-year tenured team member, Mr. Daryl Moore.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl D. Moore
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Great. Thank you, Jim. First update we'd like to provide this morning relates to our client relief programs. With
respect to deferrals, we have previously reported that we granted some type of deferral on roughly $1.3 billion in
loans, which represented roughly 10% of the portfolio. At the end of this most recent quarter, the dollar amount of
loans still in deferral mode had dropped to $138.6 million, which represents approximately 1% of the total
portfolio.
In the commercial area, requests for deferrals have effectively dried up. And we've taken the position that any
applications for future deferrals that would result in total aggregate deferment period in excess of 180 days would
be granted only in the most unusual of circumstances.
On the retail side, while we continue to receive both new deferral requests and requests for renewal extensions,
the volume of those requests has fallen significantly. While we attempt to hold aggregate deferral periods to 180
days in this portfolio as well, we are a bit more lenient with individual borrowers when the cause of their financial
issues is clearly COVID-related.
As you know, we were very successful in securing PPP funds for our clients, having originated just short of
10,000 loans with balances in excess of $1.5 billion. The recent announcement by the SBA of a streamlined
forgiveness process for loans of $50,000 or less is good news for many of our clients who received PPP funds, in
that roughly 5,600 or 57.5% of the PPP loans we helped facilitate fall into the streamlined forgiveness category.
To-date, we've submitted over 2,300 loans to the SBA for forgiveness, representing $486 million in outstanding
balances. Remaining fees on PPP loans not yet taken into income totaled $37.8 million.
Slide 5 sets out those industries that many across the banking landscape feel are most vulnerable to our current
economic conditions. There has been little change in our exposure to these industries which remains at only
roughly 7% of total loans. While there is a merit in acknowledging that these industries as a whole may be
suffering disproportionately in the current environment, it is important to note that not all of the borrowers in these
categories are experiencing difficulties, with some even doing well.
The chart at the bottom of slide 5 shows the breakout of our consumer portfolio, along with corresponding
average FICO scores. This portfolio has shown little change as well since our last presentation to you. That
having been said, we are watching this portfolio closely. With future labor market trends uncertain and deferments
expiring, consumer portfolios could come under increased stress in the coming quarters.
Slide 6 lays out trends in the most significant credit indicators. Delinquency rose in the quarter slightly to 20 basis
points of the total portfolio, with the increase in delinquency rates wholly attributable to the retail lending portfolio.
This increase in retail loan delinquencies was not unexpected, given the level of retail loans on deferment at the
end of the second quarter that were subsequently required to resume their payments by September 30.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2020
With respect to charge-offs, in an ironic twist of fate, we posted a net recovery in the current quarter, in large part
due to recovery of the write-downs we took back in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 on a
pharma-related project. This particular project became much more valuable, given its intended use in the COVID
vaccination process.
Non-performing loans increased in the quarter, as was expected. The increase in the current quarter came about,
in great part, through the downgraded relationships that had shown weaknesses prior to the pandemic, as well as
from the hotel segment that, as we all know, experienced sudden and deep troubles early on in the pandemic.
Further downgrades into the non-performing category are certainly a strong possibility, with the pace and
magnitude dependent, in some part, on the continued impact of the pandemic and the ability of Congress to come
to an agreement on additional fiscal stimulus.
One final comment I'd like to make is around the loan growth in the quarter. While we have given direction to our
underwriters to be mindful of current economic conditions, we've also asked them to keep in mind more
intermediate and long-term factors as they evaluate credit requests. Requests from borrowers with balance sheet
and liquidity staying power are viewed as opportunities and not discouraged from consideration if they meet our
lending standards, which have always been intended to live through economic cycles.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brendon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Daryl. Before turning to the quarterly financials, we would like to provide an overview of our allowance
for credit losses. Our CECL model assumptions were again derived from the Moody's baseline forecast, which
included meaningful improvements in both GDP growth and unemployment trends.
Increasing reserve needs driven by improving current and expected economic conditions was more than offset by
an increase in our qualitative reserve. Although this economic recovery appears to have garnered some traction,
downside risks remain elevated and believe it is premature to release reserves until we have more clarity on the
path of the virus and future government action.
Our current ACL to loan ratio, including PPP loans, stands at 95 basis points. Excluding PPP balances, our
allowance to loan ratio would be 106 basis points. We'd also like to remind you that we continue to carry $56
million in unamortized marks from our acquired portfolio. While these marks will not directly offset charge-offs, any
remaining mark will accrete through margin upon resolution.
Turning to the quarter on slide 8. Our GAAP earnings per share was $0.47 and our adjusted earnings per share
was $0.46. Adjusted earnings exclude $2.9 million in ONB Way related charges, as well as $4.9 million in debt
securities gains.
Moving to slide 9. We are pleased with our quarterly adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net revenue, which was 3.4%
higher year-over-year and 2.7% higher over prior quarter. This improvement was driven by commercial loan
growth, strong mortgage revenues, as well as a reduction in adjusted operating expenses resulting from good
execution of our ONB Way initiatives. Despite the challenging interest rate environment, we improved our
operating leverage by 298 basis points year-over-year.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2020
Slide 10 shows the trend in outstanding loans and earning asset mix. End of period loans increased $240 million
quarter-over-quarter, driven by record commercial production of $978 million. Approximately two-thirds of this
production was in high-quality CRE projects, spread across a variety of property types and geographies. We also
ended the quarter with a record $2.9 billion commercial loan pipeline, with over $800 million in the accepted
category. This quarter's loan portfolio yield, excluding PPP, was 3.81% with new business rates of 3.1%. The
investment portfolio yield was down 18 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 2.45%, with new purchases yielding
1.4%.
Moving to slide 11. Both period-end and average deposits increased during the quarter, mostly in the noninterest-
bearing checking and savings categories. Deposit balances benefited from increases in existing accounts, but
more importantly, we added a meaningful amount of new deposit accounts as well. Our total cost of deposits
declined from 17 basis points in the second quarter to 13 basis points in Q3.
While we continue to look for opportunities to reduce funding costs, most of our planned rate actions are now
complete. However, time deposits and borrowing costs will continue to fall as these instruments mature and
reprice. Overall, we are pleased with our results of our deposit pricing strategy that has resulted in a significant
reduction in deposit costs, while maintaining our core client base.
Next, on slide 12, you will see net interest income was unchanged from prior quarter, which was supported by our
strong commercial loan growth. Net interest margin declined 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter, which was
generally in line with our expectations. Excluding the impact of both PPP loans and accretion, net interest margin
was 2.96% compared to 3.06% in Q2. The decline in margin reflects the ongoing repricing of our earning assets,
as well as excess liquidity. Core earning asset yields were down 17 basis points quarter-over-quarter and funding
costs decreased by 5 basis points.
Slide 13 shows trends in adjusted noninterest income. Our third quarter adjusted noninterest income of $60
million represents a $2 million increase over prior quarter. The primary drivers of this improvement came from
increasing deposit service charges and mortgage revenues. Deposit-related service charges have generally
returned to pre-crisis levels, with the exception of overdraft fees, where we continue to see lower presentments.
Mortgage revenue increased $1 million over prior quarter, and with $9 million higher than the third quarter of
2019. Elevated gain on sales margins and robust production of $628 million helped contribute to the stronger
quarter.
Next, slide 14 shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses, which reflect our ongoing focus on expense
management. Adjusting for ONB Way related charges and tax-related amortization, noninterest expense was
down $1 million quarter-over-quarter. And our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low 53.1%.
As I wrap up my discussion on the quarter, here are some key takeaways. We are pleased with our overall
performance as the fundamentals of our core business continued to be strong. Record commercial loan
production led to meaningful earning asset growth, and our fee businesses continue to perform well, particularly,
mortgage and capital markets. We also continue to deliver on the promised expense savings we outlined in our
ONB Way strategic plan.
Slide 15 includes thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of 2020. We ended the quarter with a record $2.9
billion commercial pipeline, which should help sustain our recent balance sheet growth. Our expected earning
asset growth will help support total net interest income, but the impact of historically low long-term rates will
continue to put pressure on net interest margin. Funding costs will move margins lower, as borrowings and CDs
reprice at maturity, but we do not expect this will be sufficient to offset declines in asset yields.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2020
PPP loans will also impact our margin going forward, but the timing remains uncertain. PPP fees will continue to
amortize over the contractual lives, but accelerated recognition will be postponed until repayment from the SBA.
While we have started the forgiveness process for many PPP clients, a significant portion of the related fees may
not be recognized until next year.
We expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well. Wealth and investment revenue should be stable, as
assets under management have rebounded from their second quarter lows. Most deposit related service charges
have recovered nicely and should continue to trend higher. Our strong year-to-date capital markets result should
continue through the remainder of the year and into next.
The mortgage market has proven more resilient than we expected, but will still be subject to typical seasonal
declines in the fourth quarter; and 2021 revenue could be impacted by refi burnout. We continue to outpace our
planned 2020 ONB Way expense initiatives and have now realized most of the savings promised this year. Strong
year-to-date performance may impact fourth quarter incentive accruals, as we currently are on track to outperform
our 2020 budget.
As Jim mentioned in his opening remarks, we are renewing our focus on achieving our ONB Way revenue
initiative goals, many of which were delayed due to COVID-19. As these initiatives ramp up over the next several
quarters, we will likely see an increase in personnel costs, as we look to hire talent in key revenue positions in our
commercial and wealth businesses. We're also looking to infuse new talent to our technology team that will be
focused on supporting both revenue and efficiency initiatives.
We would also like to give you an update on our current capital position and outlook. We accreted an additional
40 basis points of CET1 capital, ending the quarter at a healthy 12.1%. I would also reiterate that based on our
current capital levels and our outlook on earnings, we believe we will continue to out-earn our dividend. We've
also recently updated our stress test model. And under the CCAR severely adverse scenario, we remain well-
capitalized at the lowest point in the nine-quarter horizon.
Lastly, a brief update on taxes. As we previously reported, project delays caused by COVID-19 have impacted the
timing of our historic tax credit projects. Those projects restarted in Q3, and we now anticipate completion by
year-end. Barring some unforeseen issues, we will take the full tax credit amortization and corresponding tax
benefit in the fourth quarter. The total net income benefit in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $1
million.
With that, we are happy to answer any questions that you may have. And we do have the full team here, including
Jim Sandgren.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.

James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Scott.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. I hope everyone is doing well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
We are.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good, good. And I appreciate you taking the question. Jim, I guess, the first question I wanted to touch base on
was some of the commercial growth. I think you guys have been pretty candid in the second quarter about maybe
not being super optimistic on pull-through rates, and I think we've generally seen that, in fact, be the case
industry-wide. It looks like you guys kind of bucked the trend. So maybe just a little more color on how pull-
through rates actually came in relative to what you would have hoped? And then, maybe a bit more detail on
complexion of the growth as well, if you could sort of bifurcate it between commercial and commercial real estate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Sure. I'll let Jim Sandgren start off here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Scott. So from a pull-through rate perspective, we were at a very low 23% in the second quarter. That
increased to 37% in the third quarter. Clearly, I think, folks were kind of wait-and-see due to all the uncertainty.
But, again, demand continues to be really strong. Obviously, commercial real estate kind of paved the way for our
growth in third quarter and as both Jim and Daryl talked about, really high-quality projects with developers that we
are very familiar with. We're starting to see even better structure, both from a pricing perspective, more cash
equity in the deals. So we really feel good about the production we're putting on from that standpoint.
C&I also was up 12% in the quarter compared to the second quarter. We saw some opportunities in the
educational areas, contractors, manufacturing. So with the pipeline where it is today, we're really encouraged
about fourth quarter and beyond. So even given all the uncertainty of the election and all that, our customers are
still willing to invest and pretty bullish as we look toward the end of the year.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2020
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Scott, I would say that it's really been interesting. As we've been out competing for new deals, oftentimes, we find
ourselves the only ones working really hard at it. And I think that's given us some great opportunities. As I said on
the call, Jim and I, personally, have been on a lot of calls here during the quarter, trying to bring deals across the
finish line.
There's been some banks that, quite frankly, have been a little distracted, and we've been a little bit more
focused. I think our new organizational structure through The ONB Way, that segment-based approach, really
gives us the ability to focus and get all our resources lined up to help win these relationships and bring the full
relationship over. So I think this is a good sign that the programs and the systems and the process we've put in
place are really starting to work.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. At a minimum, it definitely looks like it came through in the third quarter. So that was a pleasant surprise
vis-à-vis what we've seen in others.
Maybe just a separate follow-on question, more financial. Brendon, just looking at the sort of the puts and takes
on the volume and rate side in NII, would the hope or aspiration be that you could ultimately hold NII at least flat,
given the pressures on margin, but some of the volumes that you guys are experiencing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I think earning asset growth will certainly help to even interest income. I'm not sure it's going to fully offset
the headwinds we're going to feel in the net interest margin percentage. As we look forward, we think we might
have a similar, maybe slightly lower decline in fourth quarter. And then, I think we have a fairly dramatic drop-off,
but still a kind of slow grind downward into 2021, but at a much lower level.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And you were talking about the margin rate with the [indiscernible] (00:21:49)?

Good morning, Terry.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe start with an expense question. Jim, I think, you said the investments in The
ONB Way revenue initiatives on the hiring side would push expenses higher on a quarterly basis, and it also
sounds like that's going to continue into next year. I was wondering if you could kind of quantify that increase off
the $114 million kind of core run rate that I calculated. And just to be clear, is that kind of a pretty good run rate to
think about each quarter next year, or will there be some decline in the latter part of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
We anticipated your question. And Brendon's got all the details here for you, Terry.

Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. So I think the $114 million is a good base. I think as we think about those positions, we're going to hire
several of those individuals over the course of 2021. Our expected impact for that is around $5 million into 2021.
I'd just remind you though that we have roughly $4.5 million of merit increases that will hit next year. And also I
would expect some of that customer travel and entertainment expenses to trend higher as the world opens up
again.

And then, let me just ask a CECL question. If the key economic assumptions that you list on page 7, if they
remain unchanged over the next three months, how should we then think about the quarterly loan loss provision?
Is it more a reflection of loan growth, as any charge-offs would likely be already captured in today's reserves?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, so as – we will continue to run the model. And if the economic conditions were unchanged and the reserve
level is exactly what it is today, is what's needed at the end of the year, then yes, we would cover charge-offs.
How that's going to play out, we have yet to see. Obviously, Moody's expects things to continue and to improve,
so our reserve need may fall, but we are, at this point, not expected to release reserves, until we start to see
some meaningful charge-offs start to flow through.

Hey. Good morning, everyone. One follow-up on Terry's last question, on slide 7. The qualitative factors, I think,
we all understand, there's a lot of uncertainty, but maybe can you talk a little bit about some of the key drivers that

Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I think we need to get some clarity around the path of the virus, any additional government actions and get
a sense for what the ultimate charge-off levels will be. I don't know that we'll have a lot of those answers until at
least into the first half of 2021. As we get clarity around that, we'll be able to think differently, potentially around
the size of that qualitative reserve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, I just – given the uncertainty out there, we're going to lean on being more conservative in our assumptions
here, right. As we get more clarity, which is probably not likely to happen until the middle part of next year, then I
think, we can be looking at those factors a little bit differently. But just given all of the economic uncertainty, I think
it's better to hold it up a little higher here.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2020
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Thank you for that. And then, Daryl, maybe one for you. You talked about the potential for – and
maybe you too, Jim, for rising nonperformers and losses, and I think we all expect that. But just give us kind of a
gut feel, the pipeline of potential problem loans and how we should think about the cadence of some of these
problems flowing through?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl D. Moore A
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Jon, I wish I knew the answer to that, right. That is something that the whole industry is a bit struggling with. And
I'll go back to what Jim and Brendon said. We're only really less than two full quarters kind of into this. And so, as
we see interim financial information from our clients, it's just really hard to try to understand what ultimate losses
are going to come on that portfolio.
And again, I don't want to fall back into what everybody's saying, but the fiscal stimulus is going to have a big
impact on this. By industry, most banks, including ours, who have taken the hotel industry, we know, we're pretty
certain that, that is a long tail. And so, we've gone ahead and taking our actions on that in terms of downgrades.
And I'm not trying to skirt the question. It's just a very tough thing to try to figure out now, where we're going to be
in another 90, 180 days, and I can't give you much clarity around it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
And Jon, I'll just say, we're trying not to be surprised here, right. I mean, we meet weekly, with this group on the
call and plus some other senior commercial credit folks. And we're really trying to understand the trajectory of
each one of our clients, and which ones are more sensitive than others. So, we're not trying to be surprised
ourselves, but as Daryl said – generally, those conversations have gone pretty well – surprisingly well. But there's
a lot of uncertainty out there. And like Darryl said, we haven't seen a lot of interim financials, and so it's pretty
hard to put a pinpoint on it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then, just one small one for Brendon on expenses – again, back to expenses. You talked about
potential for incentive accruals due to outperformance for the year. Have you accrued some of that already, or
what's kind of the magnitude you're thinking for that accrual expense line?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
We did. We started to adjust accruals in Q3. But we would expect another adjustment if things play out the way
we expect in the tune of $5 million or so.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. That's the incremental for the fourth quarter, is what you're saying?

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris McGratty with KBW.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Morning, Chris.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, Jim. Morning. Morning, everybody. I want to start maybe on capital. You talked about the capital build, but
also Daryl's – the comments about the uncertainty. Jim, I'm interested in your thoughts about capital management
into next year. I think you've talked pretty confidently consistently about the dividend sustainability, but what about
the share buyback component? How are you and the board thinking about ultimately flipping that back on?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Well, I think we're going to take a cue a little bit from the regulators here, right. And the regulators have basically
said nothing this year. Obviously, they're not really talking about us. I think they're talking about our biggest
cousins here, but we're going to take that cue. And we do have Board Members asking, when are we going to
have confidence to be able to turn that back on? Having said that, I think it's in the next year, again, as we just
have more insights into ultimate loss content. We feel pretty good today, but it just seems a little premature to
want to turn that back on yet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And appreciate the color you gave on the expenses and investments you're making as part of The
ONB Way. But can you just remind us how you're thinking about the revenue side of the equation that you spoke
confidently about in your prepared remarks? Just the timing, and when we should start seeing any contribution
from the revenue investments?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Well, I do think, I mean – so we have hired folks already – a number of folks are ready across their geographies.
And I do think the growth you're seeing on both the deposit side and the loan side are really the start of, really,
those initiatives. So, higher growth in our wealth management business, that would be both the kind of the
balance sheet side, so the private banking side, but also the fee income side and obviously, our commercial
business. We haven't shared any targets, it's too early to share any targets yet, especially given kind of the
economic uncertainty. But I think those are the kind of line items: Fee income; continued strong deposit growth;
and then, the commercial side as well.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2020
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, maybe just last one, if I could. So, I'm looking at slide 10. Comparing it to last quarter, it looks like
C&I spreads jumped up almost 20 basis points, excluding the PPP. Any color on – is that just you're out in the
market lending, and some of your peers are on their heels? I guess what is that? Is that likely to continue, or what
do you see in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Chris, it's a little bit of both, right. I mean, I think, we are – as Jim said, not everybody else is out doing what
we're doing. But I also think there's a wide variance quarter-in, quarter-out, just based on how many notes were
fixed rate versus floating rate. This stuff tends to be a little bit more floating rate, which drives down the absolute
yield. But that mix shift can also shift these numbers around quarter-in, quarter-out. But we are getting, I would
say, slightly better pricing, not more – I'd like to get more pricing, but it's slightly better than we have seen in the
last year for sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Awesome. Thank you.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, David.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Want to get back to that qualitative portion of the
reserve really quick. Just, do you have a specific internal projection that you're using as to what the next stimulus
package may look like in coming up with that ultimate reserve level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
We do not. I can tell you, I think, Moody's had an expectation in their forecast for, I think, $1.5 trillion stimulus
happening in September. So the fact that, that didn't get done and maybe delayed did influence our thoughts and
decisions around the qualitative reserve. But we don't have a specific forecast internally.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then, switching gears to the mortgage banking side. Obviously, strong again there.
How does the upcoming 50 basis point fee impact your origination expectations? And is that something that you
can pass along, or how do you think that's going to work out?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2020
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
I think it's all too early to tell how much of that we can pass along. I think our own internal projections – or
assuming we take that out of our spreads. I mean, spreads have increased in that business throughout the kind of
refi bonanza we've all seen here. So that probably, at some level, comes out of our margin. But I'm hopeful that
we could pass along some of that increase through new production as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then, finally, on the capital side, obviously, you're in a very good position right now. But what
would change – or what in the economy would it take to change to change your outlook? Like, how bad does it
have to get in the overall economy for you to change your outlook and consider raising additional capital?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
That's a good question. Brendon and I've kind of chuckled a little bit. We were supposed to learn our lessons as
an industry, heading into whatever the next crisis looked like. And I felt like we had enough capital heading into
this. And Brendon shared our stress tests that we're running, right? So things would have to get pretty draconian
before, I think, I'd have to move off my position here.
I understand the rationale for kind of opportunistic issuances, particularly if we had a use for it. But at this point in
time, we feel very comfortable with our stress test models. And obviously, they're models and they could be
wrong, but it has to be significantly different than what our most severely stressed environments look like in order
for us to have a probably different view on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Good to hear. Cool. Thanks, Jim.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Was just curious, given some of that balance sheet growth, is that pretty broad-based across the franchise, or are
there [indiscernible] (00:34:09) like is it the sort of the legacy ONB franchise, or is it some of the newer markets
that you guys have? How is that all sort of projecting?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes, Scott. Specifically, on the CRE, I'd say, a big chunk of that really is up in the Twin Cities, specifically in the
suburban areas, some multi-family opportunities there with the developers that I talked about earlier, also have
seen some growth in Wisconsin, parts of Michigan and in and around Louisville. So it really has been spread
around kind of a mix of our legacy markets and our newer markets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Jim and I are heading to Minnesota after this call. And so, we've been spending time out actually walking some of
these projects, getting firsthand insights into them. So this isn't a hands-off approach. We're very active in the
business. We want to make sure, the things we're investing today, we feel really good about. And so, it's nice to
see that kind of continued growth we're seeing in Minnesota. And despite some of the challenges they're having
there, the economic vibrancy is still very strong.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Swanson Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
As regards to expense initiatives, has there been any additional look-back at the branch footprint when
considering the effects of COVID pandemic?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Absolutely. It's something that we review pretty regularly as our branch footprint. And the board has challenged us
to make sure that we've got an appropriate footprint. We don't have any new assessment to share with anybody,
but it's something we'd look at pretty regularly. And we do think, over time, just as customers continue to move
transactions to mobile and other online platforms, we will continue to have opportunities to look at those branches
a little bit differently. But at this time, don't have anything new to share.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Swanson Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then, could you talk about the parameters of what you would or would not be interested in
doing for M&A? And then, maybe any changes in expectations or willingness to sell, I guess?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Well, I think 2021 given the interest rate environment's going to be a challenge for our industry. And I think as
people put together the forecasts for next year and do the strategic planning, it could open up some opportunities
for us. We continue to think consolidating within our current footprint makes the most amount of sense, and so
we're really focused there.
We've talked about potential partnerships that are more meaningful – fewer of them, but more meaningful. And I
continue to be very active. It was a very active summer for me to make sure that I was calling on folks that we're
interested in. And we continue to do that, and be purposeful about that. So, it's on our minds. And obviously, the
farther we get into the pandemic, the easier it would be to put some balance sheet marks together.
I think it's still a little early, to be honest with you, but the farther we get into it, it would be easier to think about a
potential partnership. But at this point time, we're not looking, I think, today, so we're just going to continue to
keep – be open for opportunities.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes, Terry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Hey, I forgot to ask. I think it was last Thursday or Friday, a bunch of states had their highest one-day COVID
case count. And I believe Indiana, Wisconsin and Minnesota, unfortunately, were in that count. Earlier in the year,
that was the exact opposite. And Jim, you kind of talked about maybe the upside to your franchise, just given how
it was impacting different parts of the country in a different way, and now it's kind of come closer to home.
So, I guess, what are your updated thoughts there? And do you have any kind of updated thoughts on some of
the vulnerable industries, and whether that count goes higher, whether those industries need to be looked at yet
again?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
All, good questions. Thankfully, I would just start with our team members and our own experience here within our
four walls, so to speak, has been relatively good. We continue to make sure that our team members remain –
health and safety, it's paramount, right. But having said that, obviously, we're all concerned and we're cautious
about what's going on to some of our geographies. I'm hopeful that it's kind of temporary, as everybody move
back to colleges and maybe saw a number of increases from that.
We're watching the numbers very closely. Our Chief Risk Officer sends very regular updates on this topic. Even
during the height of maybe the first or second wave, I didn't see – we have so little restaurants. And the hotel
exposures, we talked about, are pretty well-defined. I just don't see much difference today then I saw back then,
even when the numbers were trending better. So, I don't think its gives us any kind of different outlook, Terry. But
some, we're watching very, very closely, if nothing else, for the health and safety of our team members.
