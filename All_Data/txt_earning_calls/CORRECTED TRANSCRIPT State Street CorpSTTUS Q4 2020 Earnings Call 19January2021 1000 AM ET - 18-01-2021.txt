Ronald Philip O'Hanley
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and full year
2020 financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to reflect on how State Street successfully adapted
to the unique operating environment in 2020, supporting our clients, communities in the financial system, all while
advancing and positioning the business for future success.
2020 was a year like no other in recent memory. As we entered the year, few could have predicted how volatile
the operating market – operating environment would be as the health crisis precipitated by the COVID-19
pandemic resulted in a global economic recession, which the world is still dealing with. Against that backdrop,
governments, central banks and financial institutions, like State Street, needed to act quickly to assist in limiting
the impact of this crisis on the financial markets and the global economy. 2020 also highlighted a number of racial
and social injustices that we must act to address.
When faced with these economic and social challenges, I am proud of how State Street team members around
the world lived our values of being stronger together and a trusted and essential partner to our clients and
communities, all while generating solid earnings growth for our shareholders in 2020.
As the pandemic worsened last year, our global operating capabilities allowed us to adapt quickly and deliver
products, services and results for our clients when they needed us most. In addition to the client-focused product
and service enhancements we made in 2020, we continue to transform our operating model by simplifying our
operations, increasing automation and driving productivity and efficiencies while continuing to invest in our
business.
State Street has been on a journey to transform its operating model for the last two years and we expect that we'll
be able to deliver further improvements during 2021 to drive cost lower, self-fund investments for the future, and
transform how we compete and operate in the years ahead. At the same time, the volatility in markets
demonstrated the strength of our global FX franchise, where we retain the number one market share position with
asset managers and achieved an approximately 30% uptick in revenue.
We continued our intense efforts to innovate throughout 2020 with the further development and delivery of the
State Street Alpha front-to-back [front-to-middle-to-back] platform, which has gained traction with clients. Through
the open architecture nature of the platform, we have been able to rapidly increase functionality through a number
of partnerships with leading data and analytics providers, unlocking new sources of revenue. We signed six Alpha
clients in 2020, where early adoption has helped us accelerate our development. The Alpha pipeline remains
strong.
While the Alpha platform remains an integral part of our future strategy, we also remained laser-focused on
improving the financial performance within Investment Servicing, which is the core engine of our business. We've
recently enhanced our Institutional Services client-facing strategy. And during 2021, we will leverage
improvements in client coverage, segments and regions to broaden and drive Investment Servicing revenue
growth over time. As a result, our strategic moves, the strength of our capabilities and operating model and the

commitment of our team members enabled successful navigation of 2020 and improved year-over-year financial
performance, which I will now discuss further.
Turning to slide 3, fourth quarter EPS was $1.39, or $1.69 excluding notable items. Relative to the year ago
period, fourth quarter total revenue declined 4%, largely driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our NII
results. However, fee revenue increased 2%, reversing recent trends and demonstrating an improved servicing
and management fee performance as well as strong FX trading results. Despite an increase in transaction
processing, total expenses were flat year-over-year, excluding notable items.
At the end of the fourth quarter, AUC/A and AUM both increased to record levels, supported by higher period end
markets. At Global Advisors, we had another strong performance in ETFs and cash. These results in both
businesses provide good step-off points for 2021.
Turning to our full year 2020 results. We made solid financial progress relative to 2019 as we work to drive fee
revenue growth higher and total expenses lower. Full year EPS was $6.32, or $6.70 excluding notable items. EPS
results were up 17%, and 9% excluding notable items, despite the dramatically lower interest rate environment.
Supported by year-over-year improvements in servicing and management fees, very strong FX trading results and
a higher revenue contribution from CRD, which continues to perform well, total fee revenue increased 4%.
However, total revenue was roughly flat year-over-year as a result of the impact of interest rate headwinds on NII.
Our team drove total expenses down 1.5% year-over-year, excluding notable items, as we continue to build on
the strong culture of expense reduction that we successfully established in 2019. Operating leverage was positive
and margin was up in one of the most challenging years in history.
To conclude my opening remarks, State Street faced a number of unprecedented challenges during 2020 as a
result of our operational capabilities and innovation, we were able to successfully navigate those challenges, all
the while acting as a trusted and essential partner to our clients and communities and generating solid year-over-
year earnings growth for our shareholders.
As we look ahead for the first quarter of 2021, our board has authorized up to $475 million of common stock
repurchases, which is in effect the limit set by the Fed. We are well positioned for and looking forward to returning
significantly more capital to shareholders in the future. In addition, the board has also authorized the partial
redemption of our Series F preferred stock, which will further benefit our common shareholders following its partial
redemption in the first quarter.
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail and then I will return to
update you on our medium-term targets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone.
Turning to slide 4, and before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results, let me briefly
outline $145 million of notable items we recognized in the fourth quarter, which totaled $0.30 of EPS that will
collectively help us deliver another year of declining expenses in 2021.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
First, we took an employee severance charge of $82 million to eliminate approximately 1,200 positions, mostly in
middle management, which will be partially offset by in-sourcing and critical hires during the year. This
complements the senior management reductions we made two years ago and the ongoing reduction of junior
roles through automation that were deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect this to generate savings
of approximately $120 million in 2021 and about twice that in the following year.
Second, we took a $51 million occupancy charge for real estate to reduce our total office space across 20 sites by
about 1 million square feet or approximately 13% of our total square footage. This is the start of our process of
reconfiguring our office space for a post COVID environment. We expect this action to generate savings of
roughly $30 million in 2021. We try to minimize repositioning charges, but we have delivered two years in a row of
underlying expense reduction while investing in our business and want to do so again in 2021.
Turning to slide 5, I will begin my review of both our 4Q 2020 and full year 2020 results. As you can see on the
top left of the table, we finished fourth quarter with strong revenues. Total fee revenue increased 2% year-on-year
and was up 5% quarter-on-quarter. And while interest rate environment continues to be a headwind, the absence
of the $20 million third quarter true-up combined with a stronger-than-expected balance sheet growth led to a 4%
quarter-on-quarter improvement in NII. Total expenses, ex-notables, were flat year-on-year but increased 2%
quarter-on-quarter, including currency translation and higher variable costs.
On the right side of the slide, we show our full year 2020 performance. And despite the challenging operating
environment, dramatically lower interest rates and a suspension of buybacks, we delivered full year positive
operating leverage of 1.4 percentage points, a 50 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin, and EPS growth
rate of 9%, excluding notable items. Our GAAP results were even better across the board.
Turning to slide 6. Period-end AUC/A increased 13% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter to a record $38.8
trillion. The year-on-year change was driven by higher period-end market levels, client flows and net new
business installations. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased, a result of higher period-end market levels and
better client flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 11% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter to $3.5
trillion.
The year-on-year and sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period-end market levels
coupled with net ETF and cash inflows, but offset by continued institutional outflows in the equity index product
line. Our SPDR ETF business recorded its second highest quarter of net inflows, driven by strong US and
European flows, taking total net ETF inflows to over $43 billion for the full year, almost 30% higher than last year.
Now, on to slide 7. Fourth quarter servicing fees increased 1% year-on-year, including currency translation. The
increase reflects higher average market levels, softer-than-expected sales in 2020, as well as lower levels of
client activity and normal pricing headwinds. Servicing fees were flat quarter-on-quarter, including currency
translation, as higher average market levels were partially offset by a continued normalization of client activity.
On the bottom left of this slide, we summarize some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business.
AUC/A wins totaled $205 billion, while AUC/A yet to be installed amounted to $436 billion in the fourth quarter. As
we look ahead, we are focused on generating the level of gross sales volume needed to offset the typical client
attrition and normal pricing headwinds, which we think is about $1.5 trillion or more of net AUC/A each year.
The amount of gross wins needed to offset these factors will vary year-to-year and be impacted by a number of
factors, including product mix. This would include Alpha mandates, which were over 25% of our second half

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
AUC/A wins, though, as I have mentioned before, the sales cycle and installation of these more complex solution-
focused services take some time.
In 2020, we've had some strong success in growth across our top 50 asset manager clients as well as within our
insurance and asset owner client segments. We have been disappointed, however, with our sales to our mid-
sized asset managers in North America and EMEA and are implementing a plan to address these areas of
opportunity.
On the bottom right panel, we highlight some of these tactical enhancements to our Institutional Services strategy,
which involves expanding coverage to the total of our top 350 clients and diversifying our pipeline across
segments and geographies.
Turning to slide 8, let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. Before I begin, you will
notice that for the current and prior periods, we have reclassified the AUM-based fees that Global Advisors
receives for acting as the marketing agent for the SPDR Gold ETF from FX trading services into the management
fee line. Going forward, we think this reclass better reflects the management fee performance at Global Advisors.
Inclusive of this reclass, fourth quarter management fees reached $493 million, up 3%, both year-on-year and
quarter-on-quarter, including the impact of currency translation.
Year-on-year, management fees benefited from higher average market rates and the strong ETF inflows I
mentioned earlier, partially offset by money market fee waivers of about $3 million, net institutional outflows and
the timing of cash outflows. Our fourth quarter Investment Management pre-tax margin reached 32%, which you
can see in our segment reporting in our financial addendum, and we generated significant positive operating
leverage.
Regarding money market fee waivers, we currently expect they will continue at the current rate of $5 million to
$10 million per quarter company-wide in 2021, which is included in our outlook that I will discuss further shortly.
FX trading services had another strong quarter. Fourth quarter FX revenue increased 25% year-on-year and was
up 20% quarter-on-quarter, demonstrating the strength of our top-ranked FX franchise for asset managers. Year-
on-year and sequentially, FX revenue benefited from substantially higher indirect FX volumes, as well as stronger
market-making revenue on elevated volatility as we help clients rebalance their global portfolios in the light of
ever-changing economic and political conditions. The full year 2020 FX revenue surge of approximately 30% will
obviously make the 2021 year-on-year comparisons more difficult.
Fourth quarter securities finance revenue fell 21% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower enhanced custody
balances and agency spreads. Securities finance revenue increased 5% quarter-on-quarter, however, mainly as a
result of both higher agency lending assets and higher enhanced custody balances as we saw demand for some
leverage reemerge.
Finally, fourth quarter software and processing fees were down 7% year-on-year due to lower on-prem CRD
revenue. Software and processing fees increased 19% quarter-on-quarter as a result of sequentially stronger
CRD revenue and positive market-related adjustments.
Moving to slide 9, we show CRD revenue growth and business performance metrics. We have again separated
CRD revenues into its three categories, given the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the ASC 606 revenue
recognition accounting standard for on-prem revenues in particular.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
Fourth quarter CRD revenues fell 9% year-on-year, largely as a result of the timing of revenue recognition in the
fourth quarter of 2019, but was up strongly at 16% quarter-on-quarter on higher renewals. CRD demonstrated
very strong revenue growth for the full year, driven in part by the success of the CRD wealth strategy earlier in the
year, with total stand-alone CRD revenues up 14% year-on-year and with the more durable SaaS and
professional services revenues growing 18% relative to full year 2019.
On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the highlights of the State Street Alpha front-to-back platform
sales during 2020. In total, we signed six Alpha clients during the year, including three in 4Q, which included one
new client and two clients converted from existing relationships. The Alpha pipeline remains promising as clients
begin to realize the transformational potential of the platform for their technology and portfolio management
needs.
Turning to slide 10. Fourth quarter NII declined 22% year-on-year, but was up 4% quarter-on-quarter. The
quarter-on-quarter increase in NII was driven by the absence of the $20 million true-up in the third quarter. Not
including that true-up, the significant investment portfolio balance growth and higher average loans, coupled with
a $17 billion of higher average deposits, which were worth about $10 million, and approximately $5 million of
episodic FX mark-to-market swap benefits over quarter end, were enough to offset the ongoing headwinds of the
low interest rate environment on investment portfolio yields.
Each quarter, we try to offset the persistent effect of low rates in the portfolio by taking these sorts of tactical
actions. In some quarters, we'll be able to fully offset the headwind, like we did here, as we put the $17 billion of
the deposit surge to work, but that won't be the case every time.
On the right side of the slide, we show our end-of-period and average balance sheet highlights. Last quarter, I
noted how we expect to operate around $190 billion of average deposits but that our deposit levels might increase
given the Fed's continued expansion of the money supply. As it turns out, we've begun to see the tailwind and
now expect to operate at even higher levels of client deposits and more in line with our fourth quarter average or
even higher.
We will be opportunistic from here regarding the deployment of cash and the expansion of our investment
portfolio, but we also need to be mindful of currently tight credit spreads and the potential for OCI risk from
interest rate changes.
On slide 11, we've again provided a view of the expense base this quarter, ex-notables, so that the underlying
trends are readily visible. 4Q 2020 expenses were held flat year-on-year but increased 2% quarter-on-quarter,
excluding notable items and including the impact of currency translation, which was worth about 1 point in the
fourth quarter.
Relative to the third quarter and ex-notables, we achieved a decline in the largest expense segment of comp and
benefits, while occupancy and information systems costs were held flat. However, this was more than offset by
higher transactional processing and other expenses in the fourth quarter. Transaction processing increased 10%
quarter-on-quarter as a result of variable costs tied to higher market data volumes, sub-custody balances and
brokerage volumes. Other expenses rose 8% quarter-on-quarter as a result of higher marketing and professional
fees.
For the full year, total expenses were down approximately 1.5%, ex-notables, relative to 2019, demonstrating the
solid progress we are making in improving our operating model, as we continue to reduce expenses, self-fund

investments in our business and more than offset natural expense growth. We want to be down again in 2021,
which I will detail shortly.
Moving to slide 12, on the left of the slide, we show the growth and evolution of our investment portfolio in 2020,
as we supported clients with the MMLF, and we thoughtfully put higher levels of client deposits to work to support
NII.
On the right of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we
continue to navigate this challenging operating environment with extremely strong and elevated capital levels,
relative to our regulatory requirements. As Ron noted, we are excited that our board authorized a new common
share repurchase program for the first quarter, up to $475 million, and which is in line with the new Fed limits.
We're also optimizing the capital stack by redeeming $500 million of pref stock, which will have a benefit to our
common stockholders starting in 2Q.
Turning to slide 13, you could see a summary of our 4Q 2020 and full year 2020 results. I've already covered
fourth quarter in detail, so let me say a few words about our full year results, given that we've been on a journey to
turn around growth and improve margins and returns.
Following a 3% decline in total fee revenues in full year 2019, we successfully drove a 4% increase in total fee
revenue growth in full year 2020. Many initiatives came together to successfully make this happen. Following a
6% decline in servicing fees in full year 2019, we intervened to moderate pricing pressure, we revamped our
coverage of our top 50 clients and we executed on our Alpha strategy, leading to an increase in servicing fees by
2% year-on-year, which made for a real turnaround.
At Global Advisors, despite a challenging year on our long-term institutional index product line, our ETF business
had a very strong year, with total flows up 30% year-on-year, and our cash business performing quite well. Our
FX trading services business had a remarkable year in 2020 as a result of higher market volatility and record
client volumes. And we reaped the benefit of our prior investments in our number one position with asset
managers.
On expenses for the full year, we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive cost out of the business, recording a
second consecutive year of total net expense reduction, excluding notable items and adjusting for the acquisition
of CRD, all the while investing in our products and capabilities.
All told, excluding notable items, State Street delivered full year operating leverage of 1.4 percentage points, a 50
basis point improvement in pre-tax margin and EPS growth of 9%, notwithstanding some of the interest rate
headwinds. And GAAP results were even stronger across the board. All that said, we have more to do in 2021, so
let me get into it.
Turning to slide 14, let me cover our full year 2020 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter of
2021. As I usually do, let me first share some of the assumptions underlying our current views for the full year.
At a macro level, our rate outlook assumes that short-end rates remain relatively flat and there is some modest
deepening to the yield curve in line with the current forwards and anticipates modestly slowing prepayment
speeds. We're also assuming around 7 to 8 percentage (sic) [7% to 8%] point to point growth from equity markets
in 2021 as well as normalized market volatility, which impacts our trading businesses.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
So beginning with revenue. We currently expect that fee revenue will be flat to up 2% for 2021. And fee revenue,
ex-trading, will be up 3% to 5%. This includes servicing fees growing towards the top end of the 3% to 5% range.
Regarding the first quarter of 2021, we expect fee revenue to be down year-over-year by low single-digits,
perhaps down 2% to 4%, given headwinds such as the outsized FX trading revenues we saw last year due to
volatility in the early days of the pandemic in March.
Regarding NII, we expect full year 2021 NII to be down 14% to 17% on a year-over-year basis as investment
portfolio yields continue to grind lower from prepayments and reinvestments. Regarding first quarter of 2021, we
expect NII to be down about 6% to 8% sequentially, driven by the continued impact of lower rates and day count,
and should stabilize there and be somewhat range bound, assuming that our rate assumptions do not change
significantly.
Turning to expenses, as you can see in the walk, we expect expenses, ex-notables, will be flat to down 1% on a
nominal basis in 2021 due to our continued focus on resource and infrastructure optimization, and currently
assume that currency translation will be a 1% headwind in this estimate. This net expense reduction includes
approximately 4% to 5% of variable costs and ongoing business investments in areas like CRD, Alpha, and tech
infrastructure and automation.
Regarding the first quarter of 2021, we expect expenses to be largely in line with this guide year-over-year and
consistent with the seasonal expenses usually occurring in the first quarter. We also expect releases of provisions
for credit losses during 2021 of at least a third of what was built in 2020. Taxes should be in the 17% to 19%
range for 2021.
And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Thank you, Eric. Turning to slide 15, I would like to update you on the current thinking on our medium term
targets, which we now aim to achieve by the end of 2023 on a run rate basis for 2024. At this time, we still
consider these target levels to be the right ones for our business and our shareholders. As a result, they remain
unchanged, as you can see from the slide. However, we now expect these targets may take longer to achieve
than we had initially anticipated, largely as a result of exogenous factors.
We set these medium term targets in early December 2018. Soon thereafter, interest rates fell as the Fed tried to
stimulate a slowing economy in 2019 and then, again, as COVID hit in 2020. The market went from expecting, in
2018, the Fed to approach 3% by late 2019 to ending 2020 at 25 basis points with no rate hikes expected until at
least 2023.
Meanwhile, long end rates also fell from about the 2.90% level at the time we gave the targets to average just 90
basis points during 2020. All told, we estimate that the sharply lower rate environment since 4Q 2018 has
impacted our 4Q 2020 pre-tax margin by about 5 percentage points and ROE by around 2.5 percentage points.
We also witnessed a large downdraft in global equity markets in late 2018, followed by a steady rebound in US
equity markets, but international equity market averages over the last two years were down.
While we are clearly operating in a dramatically different environment relative to when we set our targets, we have
made real progress. We went from a 3% decline in fee revenue in 2019 to a 4% growth in fee revenue by
reversing the trajectory of our servicing fees and delivering in our Global Markets business.

We are evolving our business model to become an enterprise outsource provide while at the same time,
enhancing our investment servicing capabilities and client coverage, distinguishing us from our competitors.
We've also systematically reduced net expenses, ex notable items, which has helped us begin to close the margin
gap to our peers by about 2 percentage points. We remain confident in our ability to deliver ongoing strong
expense results.
In summary, though interest rates have impacted the timing of our medium term targets, I'm confident in the
direction of our business, and we will continue to innovate to meet our clients' needs and drive business growth,
while also focusing on improving productivity to achieve our goals.
And with that, operator, we can now open the call for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is
open.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So first, Eric, for you, maybe just to clarify some of the comments
you made around servicing fees. So you talked about $1.5 trillion in sort of annual client attrition. Is that a – that's
about 4%, I think, of your AUC [AUC/A]. Is that sort of what we should be thinking about as kind of like a gross
impact on revenues as well? And qualitatively, how does that compare to prior periods? Has anything changed
that sort of drives this churn higher?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Alex, it's Eric. Thanks for the question. We're trying to be real clear about our sales expectations for our business
because at the end of the day, that is part of what we do every day, and we do it across segments, across
regions, across client groups. And I think to kind of give you some perspective on that, we wanted to be clear that
to actually have to demonstrate net new business, right, so to be able to offset the nominal amount of attrition that
we always get, which is a few percentage points, and actually overcome that, plus deliver some amount of net
new business growth, we need about $1.5 trillion of gross new sales a year to accomplish that. And we think
that's what would really contribute to the rebound of growth that we like to see.
Now, in truth, we've not gotten there this year. This year, net new business was flat. And you saw our AUC/A wins
at about $800 billion. And so, it's just obviously an area of pretty intense focus. But I think it's the kind of area that
we feel like we can make a dent on. If you step back, we've made really good progress on our top 50 clients,
where we rolled out a coverage process and set of executives about two years ago. And we've seen the growth
there. We've seen it in a couple segments. And now, we need to broaden that and deepen that kind of coverage
intensity across the rest of franchise.

is facing in terms of reduction in funds, for example, or if you think about M&A, oftentimes that presents an
opportunity for us. So there's a small amount of attrition broadly defined. It's as much asset attrition as it is client
attrition. And what we're trying to be here is very clear on how we think about what we need to do from a sales
perspective and what we're doing about it.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. That clears it up a bit. Speaking of M&A, Ron, wanted to ask you a question around SSGA.
Obviously, there's been several headlines around potential strategic actions State Street could make around its
asset management business. And in the past, you also talked about the drive for scale in that business just like
what you're trying to provide to your clients.
So maybe you can update us in your latest kind of strategic thinking for SSGA when it comes to either
acquisitions or divestitures. Obviously, there was a JV headline out there as well. And as you think about sort of
these various avenues, what is the ultimate kind of financial and strategic goal you're trying to achieve for State
Street as a whole when it comes to SSGA? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Alex, I'm not going to comment on market rumors. But what I'm going to say is what I've said before; we
have a very strong franchise in SSGA. It's particularly strong in the ETF space, the cash space, the indexing
space. It's got a increasingly strong position in ESG. Having said that, as we've said before, we see the world
evolving and, therefore, we need to think about how to add capabilities, both product and distribution capabilities,
or distribution access to this.
So it's not new. Any time you ask us about this, I think I answer it more or less the same way that we're constantly
thinking about this. We've made some steps over the past several years in terms of organically adding really
important product capability; for example, fixed income ETFs, ESG capabilities. We launched the low-cost range
of funds. We created the distribution arrangement to help propel those low-cost funds.
So we will continue to look at those things, and we'll continue to look at inorganic activities if we think it's the best
outcome. And to answer the last part of your question, what we're looking to do is to best position SSGA for
growth. It's a remarkable asset. It's got a lot of potential, and we'll do what we need to do to best position it for
growth.

first quarter and how much premium [ph] AM (00:35:38) was in the quarter. And is that part of a rate of change
that you can see any type of – helped that stabilization or benefit thereafter? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Ken, it's Eric. Sure. Let me describe, first, maybe third quarter to fourth quarter to give you some context, and
then fourth quarter to first quarter, and then kind of what we see from there. Going into the fourth quarter, we have
the usual headwinds from the investment portfolio and actually higher premium amortization than we've had
previously. And that would cost us, sequentially, about $35 million. That's kind of the headwind. That will come
back because that headwind is attenuating each quarter, but that was a headwind.
Against that headwind, in the fourth quarter, we had some unusual benefits. We had the FX swap mark-to-market,
which was about $5. We had a surge in deposits, both in developed markets and in emerging markets.
Remember, they're valuable in emerging markets, worth about $10 as a tailwind. And then we built our investment
portfolio and added quite a bit of loans to the tune of about $20 million. And that was a larger build than usual, but
a remunerative one. And so, those are the kind of features that held us flat, in effect, from 3Q to 4Q.
I think if we go into first quarter, you kind of take each of those in pieces. The investment portfolio headwind, it's
probably going to be about $25 million instead of $35 million. So you see it attenuate. And part of that is that the
prepayment speeds are neutral, we think, from 4Q to 1Q. We have some tailwinds of deposits and loans and
investments, but that's probably worth about $10.
And then, we still have a couple headwinds. We have the unwind of that swap mark-to-market, which sequentially
it's worth $10 because you got to double up, the positive turns negative. And then you have day count worth
another $10 as a headwind. So that's kind of what gets us to the guide that we gave.
Once we get through the first quarter, I think what we expect to see is that stabilization. And what we're effectively
expecting is that investment portfolio headwind which was $35 million, becoming $25 million, is going to start to
trend down to $10 million a quarter. And why is that? Partly rates have been kind of working through the – on the
yield side and partly because prepayment speeds, we expect to start to attenuate as we see higher rates. And so,
we do expect some lesser headwinds.
And against that, we think that the actions that we take on a more traditional basis will be worth about plus $10
million. And so, we'll be roughly neutral and stable from 1Q to 2Q and 2Q to 3Q and so forth. Obviously, it will be
range bound. And, obviously, there's always a little bit of lumpiness that we get into. But that's our best estimate
of what we're seeing today based on the curves, the expectations of rates and so forth.

size that a little bit, recognizing your efforts to broaden and diversify the business, just in terms of the core of what
you've got right now, either maybe size it or talk about the impact that had on your 2021 guide. And also
interested in any interaction with the activities of the pricing committee there in terms of either structuring, pricing
or what have you, in order to better retain or win business. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Sure, Adam. It's Eric. Let me start. I think the way we think about our business on the servicing side is across
segments, right? We have asset managers, we have asset owners, we have insurers. And our business is more
geared to asset managers than the other segments. And so, we've historically built our franchise there but we've
actually had quite a bit of success in other – in those other segments as well.
Within asset managers, what we're starting to find is over the last year – last two years, the last year in particular,
we've actually secured more growth in the largest of the asset managers. They're obviously winning when you
look at the external data. And either less growth or, in some cases, decline in the mid-size and smaller asset
managers. And so what – and that gap can be – that gap in a particular quarter or a year could be a 2 percentage
point growth gap. It could be a 3 or 4 percentage point growth gap. It bounces around.
And so what we're finding is that, we really feel like we have the right coverage and intensity and kind of seniority
focused on the largest of our client. But our mid-sized clients are really an important part of our franchise. We built
our franchise on them. We provide really, I think, outstanding products and capabilities. And we're finding we
need to spend both senior time on the mid-sized clients as well as the time of our relationship managers and
client executives.
And so, this is really about intensifying our coverage of those groups and helping them see the strength and the
opportunities and the products and services that we can offer, and make sure we're top of mind, that we're
building on share of wallet. I've got share of wallet statistics for top 250 clients, and that includes the mid-sized
players, and really executing in that area, day in, day out, product 1, product 2, product 30, product 50, it's literally
down at that level of granularity where we're focused now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Adam Q. Beatty Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Excellent. That's helpful on the dynamics. Thank you. And then, just a quick follow-up on MBS prepays and I
appreciate the detail from before on that. Recognizing, of course, that interest rates will be the main driver there,
do you feel as though this past year 2020, there was any type of pull-forward in prepayments or refinancing such
that a reversal and downward tick in rates might not generate the same level of prepays as previously? Or is it
very much still linked to rates? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Adam, its Eric. I always like to hope that prepayments are burning through, that there's been a onetime pop and
then they're going to attenuate. But I've learned that hoping isn't a strategy, right? We just have to operate
through the environment. I think what we've seen is certainly a surge of prepayments starting in the end of 2Q,
right, once people figure out how to do the paperwork during COVID in 3Q and 4Q.
And our best estimate is informed by the various modeling providers. We subscribe to three or four of them
because we need that diversity of opinion, suggest that prepayment speeds should probably continue into the first

quarter and then will begin to edge down from there in the second quarter and the third quarter with some
stepwise improvement.
That said, I think we've got to live through time here and just – to see how it plays out and we'll know more. What
we're trying to do, though, is make sure that we're always taking the actions that we can on investment portfolio,
on deposit reinvestment, on loans, because that's something we can control, and we need to stay focused on
those actions.

Ryan Kenny Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So we saw the OCC stablecoin approval come through earlier this month. Just wondering if that has any impact
on State Street and how you're thinking about your blockchain strategy going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yes. Ryan, this is Ron. In terms of direct impact, first, the OCC doesn't regulate us. And secondly, it directly
impacts or, if you will, poses most challenge to the payments banks. For us, in general, it's probably neutral to
positive because anything that stimulates more interest in blockchain, and particularly more interest in digital
currency, is going to create a custody opportunity for us. And we have been investing fairly significantly in that
space.
As we've said in the past, blockchain itself is actually quite an important part of lots of things that we're doing in
custody and asset servicing. And increasingly, we see digital coins, cryptocurrency, as part of the holdings within
our client base, and we'll continue to invest in that. But the OCC's work itself is, I would say, not directly relevant
to us at this time.

Brian (sic) [Ryan], its Eric. A good part of it is in the run rate. I think we said about $3 million in 4Q. We do expect
it to tick up one more step, and we're now expecting about $5 million to $10 million a quarter in the coming year.
So I think we're much less exposed than others. We don't have retail money market funds. We don't have high net
worth funds with higher fees. So – but those are the figures.

Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Good morning, folks. Eric, maybe just to continue on the net interest income guide for 2021, just if you can
just talk about your earning asset assumptions for the year and deposit growth strategy, realizing, obviously, they
spiked up in 4Q. But as you're building your servicing business and you're trying to enhance some of the deposit
strategies, maybe if you could talk about that and your assumptions for 2021. And then, in fact, also on the
premium amortization, I think you said $35 million from 3Q to 4Q. So is that about a $170 million level? Just
wanted to fact check that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Brian, it's Eric. Let me do those in reverse order. I think the – the $35 million was the headwind we're seeing on a
quarterly basis from 3Q to 4Q in the investment portfolio. And that was a combination of the investment yield grind
down and actually higher premium amortization because we're still living through that wave. What I then said is
that 4Q to 1Q, we felt the combination of the investment portfolio headwind including premium amortization, would
be about a $25 million headwind.
And then I said starting in second quarter, we thought it would trend down even further to closer to $10 million,
$15 million, and $10 million in those out-quarters each quarter. So I think what we're starting to see is an
attenuation or have that expectation, which partly is the kind of [ph] tractor (00:50:04) of the investment portfolio
playing through and partly lower levels of premium amortization expected as speeds begin to edge downwards.
In terms of the deposit forecast and the earning asset strategy; on deposits, it's really hard to gauge. The Fed
continues to expand the money supply by, what, about $120 billion a month. We're 1% or 2% of the deposits, so
we pick up deposits just by being here every month. So there's some amount of tailwind. It's just really hard to
read, given lots of talk about stimulus bills, asset allocation and reallocation from risk-on to risk-off to barbelling.
So I think, right now, we're assuming that we're going to at least stay at these fourth quarter level of average
deposits with probably a little bit of edging up. And so, we're not at this point expecting yet another surge, but you
just don't know and I think we'll obviously respond if it happens.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
In terms of asset strategy, that's a tough one. I think it's tough for us and for every other bank because we can
certainly take some risk on the curve, but you don't get paid very much for it. And so, I think there's a balance that
we're making, which is how much dry powder you want to keep.
And so, then when you do see a spike of interest rates, you can edge or leg into that at a higher and better return
versus forsaking some income in the short-term. And our investors are always kind of carefully thinking about
that, trying to be opportunistic and will come and go.
And we'll do that in treasuries around the curve. MBS, you've seen us build up our MBS book over the last year
by a solid $10 billion. I think we want to just be careful there. We prefer some of the prepayment-protected
subsegments. We've done a little bit of credit. We want to be careful there, too, because credit is impacted during
the CCAR and SCB process. So it's a pretty diversified approach, I think, is the core of our strategy, looking for
opportunities. And I think as we see some of those, we'll act. And we'll certainly report on them to all of you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's great color. Thank you. And then just back to the $1.5 trillion that you mentioned of growth servicing
wins to offset some of the headwinds. Can you talk about the cross-sell portion of that? So this would be adding
different new services to existing clients, maybe how that's sort of tracking within that outlook? And then also the
importance of SSGA's indexing business as they cross-sell to asset servicing clients?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Brian, it's Ron. Cross-sell is a very big piece of this. I mean, if you think about what Eric said earlier, you
look at 2020 performance, it was largely the same in 2019. The fastest-growing segment or the segment that
accounted for the most growth was, in fact, our global client division, which is our largest client. So by definition,
we weren't adding many to that, if any. But what we were doing was growing substantially in there.
And that will be a key part of our growth going forward for both traditional asset servicing products as some of
these institutions continue to consolidate providers, but also for front-to-back Alpha activities as we either fully
install Alpha or even put Charles River in a situation where we have the middle and the back office, but not the
front. So that's a key part of it.
As we think about the numbers, certainly, the ability to have common clients where we're both the asset servicer
and the indexer is attractive. We always look for those opportunities. That's not in the assumption that Eric's
describing there. So what we really were trying to do here in response to many questions we've gotten is, more or
less, dimension of what we need to do to grow revenue. Obviously, that number, it's based on averages. So to the
extent to which, in a given year or a given quarter, we're bringing in higher fee kinds of assets, then obviously the
$1.5 trillion goes down. So that's the way to think about it.
You could never, at the end of any particular quarter say, well, if you're not a quarter of the way there, are you
making it or not making it. You've got to go one click down and say what was the nature of the kind of underlying
business, which you'll be able to understand from us.

Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning, guys.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Hi, Rob.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
You called out some reduced client activity is pressuring servicing fees in the fourth quarter. Just wondering how
that played out with respect to expectations? And then, more qualitatively, the level of client activity you're thinking
about into the outlooks for next year – well, this year, 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Rob, it's Eric. There are a number of features in how we quantify the growth, kind of headwinds, tailwinds of
our servicing business. Client activity is one of those that fluctuates and really represents some of the trading
volumes of our clients, because there's some tolling that we do for that. In particular, cash and derivative trades
tend to more likely have tolls than others just because they're a little more complicated, ETF creation, redeem,
that kind of stuff. So it's a part of our fee schedules that we try to quantify, but has a long list of kind of volumetric
elements.
I think on a year-on-year basis, 4Q 2020 versus a year ago, some of the client activity volumes actually trended
down. So servicing fees, it was worth about 1 percentage point of servicing fee headwinds. That's an example of
a time it hits against us. For full year 2020, it was actually a positive of almost 2 percentage points. So we saw
that as a tailwind. And obviously, all the activity in first quarter, or second quarter, in particular, was helpful. Next
year, we're going to have to lap ourselves on that. So it will probably be a 1% headwind.
So it's got that kind of effect. And what it does is it reminds us that everything matters in our business to drive
growth, right? If there's an equity market tailwind or headwind that matters, this client activity matters as well. Net
new business, right, in particular, I referenced kind of the importance of gross new sales matters. And then there's
always the normalized fee headwinds, and the good news on that last one is that those have normalized back to
something pretty close to historical levels.
