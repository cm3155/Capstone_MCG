Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Curtis Chatman Farmer
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. In 2022, we generated another year
of record earnings. And in many ways, it has been an inflection point for our company. Colleagues returned to the
office reinvigorated, ready to support our customers and reimagine the way we work. And we delivered results.
Strong, broad-based loan growth in management of loan and deposit pricing in a rising rate environment drove
revenue to an all-time high of $3.5 billion.
Prudent expense discipline generated an efficiency ratio of 56% and earnings per share increased to $8.47. Our
strategic investments and balance sheet management help produce superior returns and position us to maintain a
high-level of performance. Our refreshed logo and core values reinforce our commitment to being a leading bank
for business, complemented by strong Retail and Wealth Management solutions.
Investments in more collaborative workspace, digital tools, enhanced products and streamline processes better
enable our colleagues to put our customers first and create a more elevated experience. Striving to be a force for
good in our communities, we have achieved approximately 85% of our three-year goal to provide $5 billion in
small business loans and deployed unique solutions such as our Comerica Business HQ, which provides
collaborative space in the southern sector of Dallas.
Publishing our inaugural TCFD report was an important milestone in our corporate responsibility journey and
highlights our long-term commitment to sustainable business. The report outlines our climate strategy, including
supporting our customers, integrating climate issues into our business and reduction of our environmental
footprint.
As of year-end, green loans were $2.7 billion, a 60% increase over 2021, assisted by our renewable energy
business which has already exceeded expectations with almost $350 million in loans. Our commitment to
corporate responsibility was once again recognized as we were included for four consecutive year in Newsweek's
2023 List of America's Most Responsible Companies, and also included as one of the greatest workplaces for
diversity. Volunteerism remains a priority, and I'm incredibly proud of the over 66,000 hours our colleagues
committed to positively impacting their communities.
Slide 4 provides further detail on our full-year results. Relative to 2021, average loans increased $1.4 billion, or
3%, to over $50 billion. Putting aside PPP activities, loans were up $4 billion, or 8%, our highest organic growth
rate in well over a decade, with contributions from most businesses. Following growth of almost $13 billion in
2021, driven by government stimulus, deposits decreased $2.2 billion in 2022 as customers utilize excess cash
and we executed strategic pricing actions.
Revenue increased 19%, driven by higher interest rate and strong loan growth. Non-interest expenses reflected
from strategic investments, higher compensation in conjunction with favorable performance, and modernization
initiatives totaling $38 million. Credit metrics were excellent as driven by net charge-offs of only 3 basis points,
and problem assets remain well below our historical norm. In summary, a strong performance, with an ROE of
18.6% and an ROA of 1.32%.
In the fourth quarter, we generated earnings of $350 million or $2.50 per share, as outlined on slide 5. Our
financial results were excellent with all-time high revenue of over $1 billion, up 4% over the third quarter. Average
loans grew almost $1.3 billion, which includes a $329 million decrease in Mortgage Banker, where volume had
been impacted by higher rates.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Average deposits declined $2.6 billion. However, balance has stabilized at quarter end and we began to see
some positive trends. Credit quality was exceptional with net recoveries and our percentage of criticized loans
remains well below our historical average. We built reserves in conjunction with growth and a slightly more
negative economic outlook. Expenses reflected investments in our business and support our revenue-generating
activities.
It was a record quarter and a record year. We are excited about the investments we are making to not only
support our colleagues and customers, but also to sustain our strong performance as we move forward.
And I'll now turn the call over to Jim who will review the quarter in more detail.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 6, broad-based loan growth continued and exceeded
expectations with the average balances increasing $1.3 billion or 2.5%. Commitments, which can be a good
indicator of future loan growth, increased 5%, with contributions from most businesses. Utilization remained stable
at 45% and remained below historical averages as commitment growth outperformed the increase in borrowings.
Loans in our Commercial Real Estate business increased nearly $880 million as the pace of payoffs slowed and
we fund the construction projects already in the pipeline. Consistent with our selected strategy, nearly all of the
growth was in Class A multifamily or industrial projects built by large developers that we know well, providing
significant equity contributions typically averaging between 35% and 40% of costs.
Credit quality in this portfolio continues to be excellent. Criticized loans remain extremely low and we see no
meaningful signs of negative migration. With our bankers that average 20 years of experience, a proven
operational process, stringent underwriting and consistent credit monitoring, we believe our approach results in a
conservative portfolio, appropriately positioned to navigate the current environment.
National Dealer Services loans grew over $300 million as a result of new relationships and continued M&A activity
by our customers. We continue to see a slow rebound in inventory levels and with consumer auto demand
dampening and supply chain improving, the industry anticipates inventory levels to continue increasing throughout
2023.
Corporate Banking, Wealth Management and Entertainment also contributed significantly to our strong loan
growth. Elevated interest rates, lack of housing inventory and normal seasonality continue to pressure Mortgage
Banker as average loans declined $329 million for the quarter. MBA forecast showed volumes remaining at
depressed levels through the first quarter before potentially increasing. Loan yields increased 81 basis points to
5.45%, primarily reflecting the benefit from higher rates.
On slide 7, average deposits declined as customers continued to utilize funds in their business and seek higher
yield. However, balances ended the quarter better than we expected as we adjusted pricing in conjunction with
aggressive Fed rate hikes. The strategy worked as period-end interest-bearing deposits increased to $31.5 billion.
While we did see a modest uptick in noninterest-bearing deposits late in the year, we attribute it largely to
traditional seasonality with elevated business activities, such as customers preparing to make tax payments and
distributions in the first quarter. We continue to believe future FOMC monetary actions are key to the timing of
deposit stabilization.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Our overall mix remained favorable, with 56% of average noninterest-bearing deposits, largely in operational
accounts reflecting our commercial orientation. Our liquidity position was strong with the loan-to-deposit ratio of
75%, below our historical average. Beyond deposits, we have significant capacity to support loan growth,
including repayments in our securities portfolio and efficient borrowing channels such as broker deposits and
Federal Home Loan Bank lines.
Interest-bearing deposit costs averaged 97 basis points and reflected the pricing actions taken in the fourth
quarter. Our dynamic pricing strategy will continue to balance our funding needs with customers' objectives and
the rate environment.
Average balances in our securities portfolio on slide 8 declined $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting the full-quarter
effect in the third quarter's mark-to-market adjustments. In addition, we are not reinvesting pay-downs and are
instead repurposing those funds for loan growth. Relatively stable long-term rates resulted in a positive mark-to-
market adjustment of $73 million at period-end. Our total net unrealized pre-tax loss of $3.0 billion affects our
book value, but not our regulatory capital ratios.
While we maintain the portfolio as available for sale, mostly for liquidity purposes, we typically hold these
securities to maturity, in which case the unrealized losses should not impact income. Despite a reduction in the
overall portfolio size, securities income remained relatively stable due to higher-yielding MBS purchases in the
third quarter, replacing the paydown of lower yielding securities.
Turn to slide 9. Net interest income increased $35 million to a record $742 million, and the net interest margin
increased 24 basis points. The benefit from higher rates lifted loan income $102 million and added 52 basis points
to the margin. Loan growth added $19 million and 3 basis points. Other portfolio dynamics added $1 million or 1
basis point. And while the market remains competitive, we have successfully maintained our pricing discipline. As
I mentioned, securities income was relatively stable.
As far as deposits at the Fed, higher rates partly offset by lower balances added $5 million and 11 basis points to
the margin. Adjustments to deposit pricing reduced income by $63 million while lower balances added 1 basis
point. Higher rates on our floating rate wholesale debt in addition to our August subordinated debt offering had a
$29 billion impact. Altogether, the rise in rates provided a net benefit of $53 million in net interest income.
Credit quality remained excellent as outlined on slide 10, with $4 million in net recoveries, along with a reduction
in our already low criticized and nonaccrual loans. In fact, inflows to nonaccrual loans were only $16 million, one
of the lowest levels in recent history. Loan growth and the weakening economic forecast drove the provision
expense up to $33 million, and the allowance for credit losses increased modestly to 1.24%. With our consistent
disciplined approach, as well as our relationship model and diverse customer base, we believe we were well
positioned to manage through a recessionary environment.
Noninterest income on slide 11 was robust at $278 million and was impacted by volatility in the rate environment
and equity markets. Deferred comp, which is offset in expenses, increased $9 million, generating a $6 million
return for the quarter. Higher rates earned on funds associated with settling our internal derivative portfolio drove
risk management income of $8 million.
The quarterly variance in the Visa Class B total return swap, along with the increase in card and brokerage, all
contributed positively to the quarter. As expected, customer derivative volumes slowed from recent strong activity
and there was a $1 million favorable CVA adjustment, which is a $4 million reduction from the third quarter.
Deposit service charges reflected positive momentum in Treasury management, but they were more than offset
5

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
by higher earnings credit and lower fees associated with deposit balances. Fiduciary income was negatively
impacted by fees related to equity returns and BOLI had a seasonal decline of $2 million. Despite this quarter's
fluctuations, we have a solid core product set delivering a strong level of non-capital-consuming fee income with
promising growth potential.
Turning to expenses on slide 12, we made significant progress towards our modernization objectives,
consolidating banking centers, enhancing corporate facilities, and achieving an important milestone in migrating
our technology. In all, we incurred $18 million in expenses for the quarter, which is below the estimate we
previously provided due to better-than-expected severance and asset write-downs. Excluding modernization and
deferred compensation, which is fully offset, non-interest expenses increased $19 million. In support of our growth
initiatives, we successfully attracted talent and continue to invest in products, further elevating our customer
experience. Increases in T&E, legal and marketing were correlated with the strong business activity in the fourth
quarter and driving future revenue with initiatives such as Retail Reimagined.
Foundational investments in our infrastructure enhance controls and compliance in this evolving landscape, as
well as making us more nimble with regards to technology development. We have some inflationary pressures,
including salaries for new staff and recent merit increases, and saw seasonal increases in occupancy, marketing
and other related expenses. Overall, we successfully balanced investments and other pressures with accelerated
revenue growth, resulting in a solid efficiency ratio of 53%.
Slide 13 provides details on capital management. With record earnings, our strong capital generation outpaced
capital needed for loan growth, increasing our CET1 ratio to an estimated 10.02%. As always, our priority is to
use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive return to our shareholders.
We closely monitor loan growth, profitability and credit trends as we balance, maintaining our CET1 target of
approximately 10% with our dividend and share repurchase strategy. Our common equity increased 2%,
benefiting from strong profitability and the impact from OCI losses was minor. Excluding the AOCI losses, our
common equity per share increased over 3%. Also, note that our tangible common equity ratio was 4.89%.
However, excluding AOCI, it increased to 9.30%.
Our outlook for 2023 is on slide 14 and assumes no significant change in economic environment. We expect low
momentum to continue and produce another year of strong growth across all of our business lines, resulting in
average loans increasing 7% to 8%. The pace of growth should be relatively consistent at 1% to 2% each quarter.
We expect average deposits to decline 7% to 8% as customers continue deploying operational deposits or seek
higher yielding options. We anticipate a seasonal decline in the first quarter, followed by a partial rebound and
then stabilization as we move through the year.
Comparing fourth quarter year-over-year, deposits are projected to be down only 1% to 2%. As previously
mentioned, we continue to believe the timing and scale of deposit activity will be influenced by a FOMC monetary
policy and economic activity. With this uncertainty, forecasting deposit levels is very challenging.
As we look at mix, we project interest-bearing growth driven by strategic pricing actions. By year-end, we expect
to be closer to our historical 50/50 deposit mix still very favorable. As far as pricing, we expect the first quarter to
reflect the full quarter impact from rate actions we took in the fourth quarter and after that, rate adjustment should
be more modest as we continue to focus on customer relationships, competitive dynamics and our funding needs.
We project strong net interest income up 17% to 20% over our record 2022 level, which reflects the full-year
benefit from higher rates and we are assuming rates follow the 12/31 forward curve. First quarter will be impacted
by two fewer days, seasonal deposit outflows and continued deposit pricing actions. We expect net interest

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
income to increase through the year as we continue to benefit from rising rates and loan growth in conjunction
with expanding relationships and acquiring new customers.
Credit quality has been excellent and we expect it to remain strong. Therefore, we forecast net charge-offs at the
lower end of our normal range of 20 basis points to 40 basis points. Assuming the economy performs in line with
our expectations, we expect a gradual normalization in credit metrics and our reserve level. We expect non-
interest income to grow 5%. Customer-related income is projected to increase, particularly in card, due to our
payment strategy and fiduciary income, which benefits from investments on our Wealth Management platform.
Also, we forecast an increase in risk management income related to our internal hedging position. Note this
income will vary over time as rates move. Deferred comp was an $18 million [ph] upgrade (00:19:31) in 2022,
which we assume will not repeat. On the other hand, elevated volumes of customer derivatives that we saw in
2022 are not expected to continue. However, we believe they have stabilized at a strong level and are poised to
grow over time.
A reduction in our deposit service charges is expected due to an increase in commercial account ECA rates and
adjustments to our retail NSF fees. We also assume BOLI returns to a historical run rate of approximately $9
million to $10 million a quarter and the $7 million CVA benefit does not repeat. First quarter is expected to be
impacted by seasonality and syndication fees. And we assume deferred comp of $6 million in the fourth quarter
will not repeat. The second half of the year is expected to be stronger than the first as loan syndication activity,
card fees, derivatives and other products trend up.
Our 2023 expenses are expected to grow 7% or 4% on an adjusted basis, excluding the $64 million increase in
pension, a $19 million reduction in modernization charges and assuming the $18 million in deferred comp benefit
does not repeat. Drivers of the 4% include the annual merit increase and other inflationary pressures as well as
additional growth in cost tied to revenue-generating activity such as higher staff levels and outside processing
related to card. Further, we estimate a $15 million increase in FDIC expenses and higher software costs. We
expect these headwinds to be partly offset by resetting performance comps to normal levels.
First quarter expenses are expected to be lower, with the decline in performance comp, seasonal declines in
advertising and staff insurance as well as other items that are expected to decline from an elevated fourth quarter
level such as modernization expenses, deferred comp and legal costs. Annual stock compensation is expected to
partly offset these reductions. Remaining modernization expenses are expected to be weighted more towards the
second half of 2023. We remain committed to prudent expense management, including investments we are
making to increase revenue and enhance efficiency, evidenced by an efficiency ratio forecasted below 55% for
2023.
In summary, we drove robust loan growth and fee generation in 2022. In addition, we benefited from higher rates
while executing our hedging strategy and manage deposits, credit and expenses. We generated record revenue
and EPS, reduced our efficiency ratio, and delivered strong returns. Our fourth quarter has positioned us well for a
strong 2023.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.

enhance our ability to continue to exceed our customers' expectations. Modernizing our operations and further
securing our foundation creates a stable but agile platform, enabling us to better address evolving needs.
Enhancing our capabilities based on the voice of our customers allows us to invest efficiently, driving fee income,
retention and new acquisition. Selectively exporting our business model to high growth markets, capitalizing on
our expertise and relationships to broaden our reach, as we strive to grow at a faster pace in the economy. The
calibration of our products, markets and delivery is critical to sustaining our legacy while achieving our vision for
the future.
Slide 16 highlights our compelling story. Our business demonstrated ability to deliver broad-based revenue
growth, and our pipeline commitment and product innovation create further momentum. As a leading bank for
business, complemented by strong retail and wealth management capabilities, we feel our size, business mix and
market strategy create a unique relationship banking model. Tenure of our colleagues and customer relationship
is evident in success of that strategy. Credit expertise allows us to not only minimize risk, but also serves the
customer acquisition tool, demonstrating our understanding of the business and needs.
Looking into 2023, we expect another year of exceptional results. While we continue to make critical investments,
which project positive operating leverage, maintaining strong profitability metrics, we've got a unique position in
growth markets with a proven reputation for credit, expense and interest rate management, combined to create a
powerful investment thesis for our shareholders.
Thank you for your time. And now, we'd be happy to take some questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia from Morgan
Stanley. Please go ahead.

Manan, good morning.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering, for 2023, can you help us with how you
expect your funding mix to evolve through the year? And as you mentioned, it's difficult to forecast deposit growth
given the Fed actions and the overall environment. So if you could help us with any updated thoughts where you
might be okay with your loan-to-deposit ratio going and how much flexibility you have there. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Manan. It's Jim. I will answer that question. Starting with the funding mix, it's really important to us
to stay diversified, so we're using a variety of efficient funding mechanisms while keeping some dry powder for
future loan growth. And so when we look at what we plan to do in 2023, first and foremost, we are funding much
the loan growth. And to the extent we have deposit runoff, we're funding that with securities that we are allowing
8


Comerica, Inc.
(CMA) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
to mature. That includes both MBS securities that matured in somewhat predictable rate, as well as some lumpy
treasury maturities that we have.
Beyond that, we are getting a little bit more competitive with our deposit pricing, both in terms of retaining deposits
and attracting deposits that might not be currently on our balance sheet. And then beyond that, we do have
efficient lines to the FHLB, which we plan on using to some extent. We do plan on adding some broker deposits,
not a lot, but we will add a modest amount likely at some point here in the year. And so, we will use a variety of
sources. We will keep a lot of dry powder on the sidelines to make sure that we can fund ourselves very efficiently
going forward.
In terms of loan to deposit ratio, it is currently well below historical levels at 75%. We expect it to continue to be
below historical levels as we look out in the future, certainly for 2023. So no concerns from that standpoint and we
feel really solid in terms of our ability to fund this loan growth and fund any deposits that might run off.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
That's really helpful. So for the securities paydowns, I know you mentioned is about $1 billion – a little bit over $1
billion for next quarter. Can you help us with how that evolves through the year? Are there any other
[indiscernible] (00:27:02) maturities coming through in the second half?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. We would expect the MBS securities to continue to mature at a rate of about $450 million a quarter. We do
have a $700 million of treasuries that mature in the first quarter, and then we have another $300 million in the
second quarter of this year. And then we have a very small tranche I believe in December that won't be a big
factor for 2023. But we should get somewhat of a boost from those maturing securities as they occur through the
year.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning. I want to start, so the guidance implies NIM expansion [ph] on top (00:27:55) again for the first
quarter. And we know it's a very fluid situation. But from a big picture view as we sit here today, how do you guys
see the NIM trending beyond the first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Steve. It's Jim. As you know, we typically don't like to focus on NIM just because of our business
model and it does tend to be a little bit more lumpy than other banks. We like to focus on net interest income. But
to answer your question, we do expect NIM to be relatively stable in the range that it was in the fourth quarter. It
may tick up by a few bps as we see securities run off with those lower-yielding securities, but I think where we're
at right now in the fourth quarter is kind of the area that we will likely hover in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And, Jim, what's the deposit beta you're assuming in this guidance by year-end 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Deposit beta is moving as well as, of course, the overall rate environment. We were about at 26% beta in
the fourth quarter. Rates did continue to move to the fourth quarter. So, I would say we were approaching 30%
beta by the time you got to the month of December.
We do think, in the first quarter, we will start moving and eventually reach about a 35% beta. And for the full
quarter average in the first quarter, I do think it will be in that low to mid-30s, pushing up to 35%. And then, as we
move through the second quarter, I do have us moving into the upper-30s. That does include going after some
higher-priced deposits to make sure that we can fund our loan growth in an efficient way.
And then, once we get through the second quarter, as we hover in that upper-30s, if we had some broker
deposits, it could push towards about 40%. I would then expect it to kind of hold there and that's about the time
that rates peak also. So, that's kind of the trajectory we're assuming and that I see for deposit betas.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's very helpful. And then, maybe for my final question, just diving a bit deeper into the decline in non-
interest bearing, you guys are citing customers investing in their business. But I'm curious how much is your
customers chasing higher rate alternatives. And along those lines, up until this quarter, what we had heard from
many of the regional banks was that treasuries were the key competitors. But what's coming up this quarter is that
the regional banks themselves are really stepping up competition for deposits. So, how much are your customers
chasing and can you talk about the competitive environment right now, particularly from peer regionals? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I mean if I understood the question, you were dipping a little bit out in terms of volume there, but our
customers, when they do look at the higher yielding options, they are looking at off-balance sheet, money market
10


Comerica, Inc.
(CMA) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
funds and we are increasingly becoming competitive to make sure we can compete from that standpoint. And we
think that's an efficient way to go. It's certainly better than wholesale borrowings for us.
In terms of where the leakage is occurring, we do some surge deposits still in the DDA. And as we talk to
customers and look at what's happening in the flows, it does seem like, probably 40% of them, to the extent 40%
of the deposits that have gone off the balance sheet are due to rate. And then, the remainder is kind of due to
funding CapEx, operations and maybe a variety of other things.
So, certainly, a mixture. We do think to the extent customers are using deposits to fund their operations, we view
that as a very positive sign. It is consistent with the loan story, when you look at the strong loan growth that we've
seen and we've forecasted. But we are increasingly becoming competitive with money market funds where we
feel we need to.

Hey, good morning. Just kind of a follow-up there, Jim. Are you seeing any cresting in deposit pricing pressures?
Is it decelerating at all?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
I wouldn't say it's decelerating. I wouldn't say it's accelerating either. It kind of feels like it hit a certain pace in
November and December. And the more price sensitive customers have already asked to be re-priced, so from
that standpoint, you could see the pressure start to step back a little bit. And some of these things – some of

these are discussions that go on for several weeks. So, it's really hard to pinpoint exactly what it's cresting, but it's
certainly not accelerating.
But I do see that momentum continuing probably through the first quarter in terms of exception pricing. In terms of
what we need to do with standard pricing, it does feel like that maybe is abating a little bit. But there are always
those exception customers that are out there and I don't expect those to take a big step back over the next
quarter.

And we'll likely get more competitive intentionally in terms of just going after customers that perhaps have moved
their balances off balance sheet over the course of the last nine months.

Okay. And I know you just said you don't like to talk about the NIM, but I'll ask you about that anyway. You're up
170 basis points year-over-year, and you're talking about stability. What kind of threats do you see to that NIM
level? I know you've done a lot of hedging, but do you feel like that's a sustainable NIM level in kind of varying up
and down rate environments?

I think the key to that is going to be DDA. That is really the wildcard and it really has the ability to move net
interest income a lot. You think about just $1 billion of DDA movement could create a $55 million drag in this
forward curve environment. So, that is going to be the wildcard. So, we think we can hover kind of in the upper 3s,
call it the low to upper 3s, or I'm sorry, mid to upper 3s, but more weighted towards the upper 3s. But I do think
that DDA is going to be the key to that assumption and that outcome.

Okay. Good. And then just one quick one to Melinda. Expected reserve build, how would you like us to think
about that? It seems like credit is very clean. And obviously, you're talking about the lower end of charge-offs. So,
how do you want us to think about the reserve build?

Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Jon, good morning. I would say that consistent with what we said last time, that if the economic forecast
stays relatively stable, you're going to see continued loan or reserve build that's really consistent with our loan
growth. So the reserve right now we feel is conservatively positioned. We feel really good about it. And assuming
no material deterioration in the economic forecast, I think that reserve build will approximate what we have going
on from a balance sheet growth perspective. And the current assumptions on the reserve build is for – our

baseline is mild recession. So, I think we've adequately factored in what the current economic forecast is, looks
like.
