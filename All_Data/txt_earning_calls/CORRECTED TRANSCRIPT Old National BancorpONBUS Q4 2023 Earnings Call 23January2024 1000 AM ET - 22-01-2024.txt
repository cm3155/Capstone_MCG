Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Good morning. Old National reported strong fourth quarter and record full year results earlier this morning. During
2023, we successfully navigated a challenging interest rate environment along with industry-wide liquidity
pressures earlier in the year. At Old National, executing our basic banking strategy has served us well. In fact, our

2023 adjusted EPS, return on average tangible common equity and efficiency ratio were the best in our nearly
190 year history.
Tangible book value per share also grew by 17% year-over-year, combined with our roughly 3.7% average
dividend yield gave shareholders a strong return for the year. Our peer-leading deposit franchise, disciplined loan
growth, strong credit quality and well-managed expenses, and dedicated team members who are committed to
our clients and communities drove these outstanding results.
While many in our industry spent the year on defense, we remain on the offense by continuing to invest in new
client-facing and key support talent and being ready and opportunistic for acquisitions, as evidenced by our
recently announced CapStar Bank partnership, which will expand our franchise to the highly dynamic markets of
Nashville, broader Tennessee, and Asheville, North Carolina. I will share more details about our progress with the
strategic partnership later in my comments.
Starting on slide 5, GAAP earnings for the year were $1.94 and adjusted EPS was a record $2.05 per common
share, representing a 5% increase year-over-year. Our adjusted return on average tangible common equity and
efficiency ratio were records at 21.3% and 50.4% respectively. Adjusted ROA was a strong 1.28%.
Moving to slide 6, we reported GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.44 per common share. Our adjusted
EPS was $0.46 per common share and our adjusted results included higher than run rate cost related to a true-up
of the accrual for the annual short-term incentive plan and additional tax credit amortization for the quarter, when
combined, resulted in an after-tax adjustment of approximately $7 million or $0.02 of earnings per share impact.
Returning to our CapStar partnership, we have filed our regulatory application and announced an additional $1.2
billion investment in Tennessee as a part of our existing community growth plan. As we spend time with our new
team members, we are even more excited about our partnership. Our existing team in Nashville was already off to
a great start and we're seeing many new client acquisition opportunities from that team, which will only build as
we close on our partnership. We still expect to close in the first half of the year.
In summary, our 2023 EPS results prove more durable than most peers in a challenging year due to relentless
focus on the basics, growing core deposits, consistent strong underwriting, disciplined expense management and
ample capital. Brendon will provide you with our official 2024 outlook at the end of his prepared remarks. But as I
look forward, it's difficult to predict what the year will bring. Predictions range from a few rate cuts to more than a
handful, from a soft landing to something more severe. Regardless of what transpires, we have entered 2024 in a
strong position by continuing to execute on our basic banking strategy and we are set up to be successful in
whatever comes our way as we have for the past 190 years.
I would like to recognize Mike Scudder. As planned, Michael retired as Executive Chairman of Old National
Bancorp at the end of January. I want to thank Mike for his combined 38 years of outstanding leadership and
dedication to First Midwest and Old National. His contributions to the board and me personally were invaluable as
we completed our transformational partnership and successfully navigated the last two years.
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Brendon to cover the quarterly results in more detail.

Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thanks, Jim. Beginning on slide 7, we present our fourth quarter balance sheet, which highlights improvements in
both liquidity and capital positions. Our fourth quarter core deposit growth has allowed us to organically fund loan

growth and continue to reduce wholesale borrowings and brokered deposits. We ended the year with a strong
CET1 ratio of 10.7% and we continue to accrete capital at a faster pace than most through the combination of our
better than peer return profile and our at-peer payout ratio.
Tangible book value per share grew 11% quarter-over-quarter and 17% year-over-year, due to strong earnings
and a 24% improvement in AOCI. Overall, improvements in our liquidity and capital levels allowed us to stay on
the offense in 2023, and our Q4 performance only strengthens our position as we begin 2024.
On slide 8, we present the trend in total loan growth and portfolio yields. Total loans grew in line with our
expectations, and we remain focused on full relationships and structure at a price that meets our risk-adjusted
return requirements. The investment portfolio increased during the quarter, largely due to changes in fair values.
Please note that we did execute a small loss trade on $41 million of securities with an earnback inside of one
year.
Moving to slide 9, we show our trend in total deposits, which were stable quarter-over-quarter, including $340
million of normal seasonal public fund outflows and a $164 million decrease in brokered deposits. Our brokered
deposit as a percentage of total deposits is now 2.7%, which is well below peers. We experienced strong growth
in both personal and business accounts, largely through CD and money market promotions.
New checking account acquisition was strong and continues to outpace attrition. However, migration to higher
yielding products continues to impact the growth in this category. We are still experiencing upward pressure on
deposit rates, but we have seen a marked deceleration in deposit costs in the quarter and into January. Total
deposit cost for the month of December was 190 basis points, only 5 basis points higher than our Q4 average.
Overall, we are exceptionally pleased with the execution of our deposit strategy that has led to above peer deposit
growth at below peer costs.
Slide 10 provides our quarter-end income statement. We reported GAAP net income applicable to common
shares of a $128 million or $0.44 per share. Reported earnings include the following pre-tax items, a $21.6 million
gain on the sale of Visa Class B shares, as well as a $19.1 million charge for the FDIC special assessment, $6
million in merger-related charges, and a $4 million contract termination charge. Excluding these items, our
adjusted earnings per share was $0.46.
Moving on to slide 11, we present details of our net interest income and margin. As expected, deposit repricing
led to modest declines in both net interest income and margin. New loan production rates of 7.72% and marginal
funding costs in the low 4% range support our expectation, that net interest income should bottom out in Q1.
Slide 12 shows trends in adjusted noninterest income, which was $79 million for the quarter. All of our primary fee
businesses performed as expected with seasonally lower mortgage revenue.
Continuing to slide 13, we show the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses, which were generally in line with our
Q3 guidance, excluding $10 million of year-to-date performance-driven incentive accrual true-up and $5 million in
higher amortization of tax credit investments. Our 2023 incentive plan was tied to deposit costs and growth
relative to our midsized peers.
Our outperformance in both these categories was critical to our record year and ultimately drove the higher
incentive. The tax credit amortization charge was due to timing of project completion with the corresponding offset
in tax expense. While both these items are within core earnings, we obviously do not expect them to run rate into
first quarter.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
On slide 14, we present our credit trends, which remained stable, reflecting the quality of both our commercial and
consumer portfolios. Delinquency and nonperforming loan ratios are largely unchanged. Non-PCD net charge-offs
were a low 3 basis points, with PCD charge-offs of 9 basis points. Our fourth quarter allowance, including reserve
for unfunded commitments, was unchanged at a 103 basis points and there were no material changes to our
model assumptions and the weighting on the Moody's S-3 scenario remains at 100%.
On slide 15, we provide a comprehensive overview of our capital position at the end of the quarter. We observed
improvements in all regulatory capital ratios and an 11% increase in our TCE ratio, driven by strong earnings and
assisted by improvements in AOCI. Following our 24% recovery in Q4, we anticipate an additional 20% of our
outstanding AOCI to accrete to capital by the end of 2024.
In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year performance in what was a challenging year
for our industry. 2023 proved to be a record year in a number of critical performance metrics, including adjusted
EPS, return on tangible common equity and efficiency ratio. We have improved the efficiency of our balance sheet
with strong core deposit growth, which has led to better funding mix and better than expected net interest income.
We continue to demonstrate our ability to expand our customer base, while maintaining peer-leading deposit
costs. Our strong liquidity also positions us well to take advantage of new lending opportunities. The credit
portfolio remained stable and our disciplined approach to managing expenses is evident in our full year adjusted
efficiency ratio of 50.4%.
Slide 16 includes additional detail on our rate risk position and net interest income guidance. NII is expected to fall
approximately 2% in Q1, remain flat in Q2, and then begin to increase in the back half of the year. The
assumptions are all listed on the slide, but I would highlight a few of the primary drivers.
First, we assumed three rate cuts in the back half consistent with the Fed guidance. Second, we are anticipating
additional late cycle deposit repricing that will give us a terminal beta of 39% by midyear and a noninterest
bearing deposit mix that falls to 24% by year-end.
Lastly, we assume the closing of our CapStar partnership at the end of Q2. We believe we have positioned the
balance sheet well as we approach the end of this rate cycle with most of the work to achieve a neutral rate risk
position behind us. Also, we did run a forward curve scenario, including six rate cuts, and the result was not
materially different from our three rate cut scenario.
Slide 17 includes thoughts on our outlook for the remaining items for the first quarter and full year 2024. And all
guidance assumes CapStar closes at the end of Q2. We believe our current loan pipeline should support first
quarter growth in the 1% to 2% range and full year growth of 12% to 13%. We anticipate continued success in the
execution of our deposit strategy and expect to meet or exceed the industry growth in 2024.
We expect Q1 noninterest income to be consistent with Q4 with the full year up 6% to 7%, with the typical
seasonal patterns. Our expense outlook for the first quarter should be approximately $248 million, modestly
higher than our Q4 base of $240 million, which excludes the incentive true-up and tax credit impact.
For the full year, we expect expenses just over $1 billion. Net charge-offs are expected to range between 15 basis
points to 20 basis points and provision expense should be approximately $80 million to $85 million for the full year
of 2024. This excludes the day one non-PCD double count associated with the acquisition. Turning to taxes, we

expect both a first quarter and full year effective tax rate of approximately 25% on a core FTE basis and 22% on a
GAAP basis.

Mark Sander, Jim Sandgren, and John Moran.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Scott. Good to hear from you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
You too, you too. Thank you. Brendon, I wanted to ask you about some of the nuance in the NII. So it looks like
NII should drop in the first quarter which is great. Maybe, I was hoping you could discuss some of the puts and
takes. Obviously, day count becomes a factor in the first quarter, but maybe sort of the interplay with how the
margin fits in there. And then I think that you said margin might expand in the second half, if I heard that correctly.
Maybe just some thoughts as we go forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Sure, Scott. Yeah. So we're looking at approximately a 10 basis point decline in net interest margin into Q1 levels
off from there and probably growth a little in the back half. Obviously, as we get three rate cuts since we position
the balance sheet accordingly, we don't think we'll get a lot of impact from – or negative impact from rate cuts in
the back half. And then we get the benefit of all the fixed asset repricing and the growth both organic and from
CapStar in the back half of 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. And then I guess along the lines of sort of underlying loan growth, you've kept the 4% to 6% expectation.
Maybe just some thoughts on how that evolves through the year. And industry trends have, of course been pretty
soft. But I think you guys have gotten, at least your fair share, if not a little more of any opportunities that are out
there. So maybe just sort of your thoughts on how things trend, including demand through the year?

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
I think you summarized it well, Scott. I mean, as much as loan demand has slowed somewhat, customers are still
feeling okay. C&I clients are, I would say, cautiously optimistic for 2024, financials are holding up well.
Employment levels are keeping consumer spending at solid levels. And – but again I think that most of them think
growth is going to slow a little bit in 2024. And CRE activity, of course slowed in the last year as expected as we
got into. But it's begun to pick up a little bit. Competitors are getting more active. And as much as – that still has to
play out. There's a – rents are holding up well in the segments that we're active in, in multifamily and industrial.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Hi, Terry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Maybe first question – hi. Could you maybe expand on the $5 billion of time deposits repricing over the next year?
I'm seeing kind of brokered CDs were over $5 billion; other times, were just below $4 billion, and it looks like the
seven-month promo is about $4.75 billion. So, what are your underlying assumptions there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. So a lot of these CDs [indiscernible] (00:17:01) not almost, but exactly 87% of our time deposits will mature
within the next 12 months. I think you have the weighted average rate really close in that four handle. And so we'll
have the opportunity to reprice a bulk of these CDs lower throughout the year. In fact the repricing characteristic
actually gives an opportunity to reprice those, most of those early in the first half of 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then maybe just stepping out of the model for a bit, Jim, we're hearing the word scale more and more from
banks with assets, call it over a $100 billion or over $250 billion. So my question is, how are you thinking about
scale as a $50 billion bank and your ability to compete with community banks as well as the larger banks?

James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Terry, I really think we're in a sweet spot. We're big enough [ph] to be relevant and compete (00:17:49) for almost
any client situation in the markets we serve. We're not so big that we get in our own way sometimes. As you get
bigger, we know that happens. We're close to our clients. We're nimble, we're fast, we're opportunistic. We can
reach out and touch our clients and touch our team members on a regular basis. I really like the size we're at
today. And given where we're operating on an efficiency ratio basis, I think we're operating fairly efficiently. So I'm
really happy where we're at and don't see any need to do anything dramatically different than we're at today.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Maybe a question on credit. You still have a 5% PCD mark for First Midwest. How should we be thinking about,
portfolios that you're maybe watching a little bit more closely going into 2024? Any de-risking or exits or tweaking
that needs to happen and just kind of broader credit commentary? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, we feel good about where we are with credit, certainly, Chris. This is Mark. We saw a little further modest
risk rating migration in Q4, but consistent with a little bit of a slowdown and a more limited growth. I mean, we feel
good about where our portfolio is at. There's certainly areas we're watching more closely. Obviously, CRE Office,
like everyone, and that'll remain to be play out. Senior housing is something that is slowly recovering, but is – the
portfolio quality there we feel really good about. So no real changes in our underwriting and feel real good about
where we're at.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
Great. Thanks. And then maybe, Brendon, a question just on the balance sheet. How do we think about maybe
adding bonds at this point to reduce more rate sensitivity, just overall size of earning assets for 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, yeah, yeah, great question. So I think there's some – I think there's some opportunity, some work to do on
a rate risk position. That will include likely some reinvestment of cash flows in the invest portfolio and probably
adding some floating rate debt to offset. So I think that would enhance our rate risk position and not have a
negative impact on net interest income.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. But just beyond the maturing cash flows of the bond book, will the bond book grow in an absolute basis or
just...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A

No, no. Not expected to grow, but I do think we'll start to replace it and hold it at approximately at these levels.

I just wanted to ask on the running on the nuances of the deposit beta commentary. So, we're going to peak at
39%. Is that happening in 1Q? And then the declining to a total beta of the low-20s by 4Q 2024 feels a bit more

conservative than what some of your larger peers have kind of outlined in terms of talking about pretty aggressive
down betas within their NII guide. And I guess what makes you feel more conservative when you talk about your
beta?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, sure. I'll answer the first part of that first. So, we think our deposit beta peaks on the upcycle, not so 2Q,
although kind of a very slight modest kind of quarter-over-quarter impact to total deposit costs from 1Q to 2Q in
our model. On the back half, we didn't go up as high. We have 35% of our book as exception price. We think we
can drive a really strong beta down on that side. But I also think deposits are still really valuable and we got to be
pay attention to maintaining, continuing to grow deposits, to continue to take advantage of lending opportunities.
And I think that probably informs the more conservative guide on the way down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And I wanted just to also ask on the securities. Could you remind us – I think you have over a $1
billion in securities that are set to mature and reprice in 2024. Would you plan on kind of running those down and
using it to fund the good loan growth that you've talked about in the guidance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
I think a little bit of a mix, Brody. Certainly, we will start to reinvest some of the cash flows off of that book and
that'll come at a positive spread about 150 basis points. And we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. And a lot
of that is dependent on our ability to continue to grow deposits well and then ultimately loan demand.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And if I could just sneak one more in, the $2.5 billion of balance sheet hedges that you have, are – can you
just clarify? Are those – is that just on the loan book? And then do you have any maturities of swaps occurring in
2024 or 2025 that are meaningful that we need to be aware about?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. So it's a mix on both the invest portfolio and our – on our loans. I think we don't have a ton maturing. We
actually had the duration of these pretty, pretty far out as we are trying to – we didn't want to be too precise on the
timing expectation around rate cuts, so we have [ph] some cuts (00:23:39). No major maturities or anything rolling
off of significance there and probably some more work to do before we're done with the year.

A couple of follow-ups. By the way, slide 16 is really good. That's a great slide. Terry took one of the questions on
CD repricing, but you talk about exception pricing on 30% of your deposits. Has that eased at all? Is that just a
product over last spring or early summer is that persistent?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
That's been fairly persistent. We continue to go out there. We've been unapologetically aggressive in gathering
new deposits. And so that's creeped up a little bit every quarter. And we'll continue to be aggressive, although we
could do that at marginally lower rates in this environment than we have for the last couple of quarters. So we
think that exception price or marginal cost will be a little lower than it has been. But that – yeah that's been a big
part of our success this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, okay. Slide 19, you talk about your commercial real estate maturing inside of 18 months. And just a small
bit of it is – you've got that 4% demarcation line, I understand that. But what is the message here on credit? Is it
that we're going to see some incremental NPLs as this stuff gets repriced and reworked or you're just – you're not
seeing that at this point in time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
We're not seeing this that at this point – at this point in time. I think, again, the CRE office still has some time to
play out. So could you see some go to criticized and classified? Could you see that increase a little bit? Yes, but
we don't – we think we're ahead of identifying. We like to identify early and aggressively take action. I think that's
what we continue to do. So we're just trying to size up kind of where some of the risks are. We think they're very
manageable.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Good. And then if I can add one more, just, Jim, anything on CapStar, anything new to report or
updates? And just you put out a date. I know that's difficult, but just confidence level and putting that date out for a
close? Thanks.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
James A. Sandgren A
Chief Executive Officer-Commercial Banking, Old National Bancorp
We feel really good where we stand today, both in terms of the people and the client opportunities. I mean, every
time we're with our team members, both the existing team members and our new team members, we just feel
really good about the opportunities. And I do think some of that growth we're going to experience is going to come
out of places like Nashville, Detroit, Kansas City, St. Louis. We've got new team members that we've hired in the
last handful of years just to continue to execute and create new opportunities for us that just weren't available to
us in the past.
With respect to the regulatory applications, we're really good about that. We're in constant dialogue with the
regulators. We obviously announced our addendum to our existing community growth plan, which we thought was
an important step as a part of the process to get to the finish line here. So, I mean, it's hard to always predict
exactly when you're going to get approval for these things. But nonetheless, we feel really good about where we
stand at this point in time. And more importantly, I just think Nashville, Tennessee, the Asheville location will
continue to represent a great opportunity for us to grow and probably contribute in the future in a much more
meaningful level than even a typical partnership of that size would contribute.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. You've got some new Investor Day potential locations as well.
