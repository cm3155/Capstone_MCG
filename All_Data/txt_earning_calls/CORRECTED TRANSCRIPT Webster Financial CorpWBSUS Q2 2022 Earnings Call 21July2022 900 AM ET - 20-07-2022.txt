Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
I'm on slide 2. As I mentioned just a moment ago, the second quarter is a great reflection of Webster's potential.
The earnings power of our new company is materializing in the first full quarter following the close of our merger
with Sterling. We exhibited strong and diverse loan growth, the quality of our core deposit franchise led by HSA
Bank and our consumer banking team with a rising rate environment and we maintained an advantageous capital
position.
On an adjusted basis, eliminating one-time merger related costs, we generated EPS of $1.29 with a return on
assets of 1.41% and a return on tangible common equity of 18.5%. Our efficiency ratio was 45%, as we continue
to execute on the synergies our merger provides and leverage the diverse competencies of our company.
Our loans and total assets grew 4.8% and 3.8%, respectively, in the quarter. Loan growth was generated across
broad industry sectors, business lines, geographies and asset classes. And our asset quality metrics remain
favorable. With an expanded geography and a growing number of industry verticals, our talented colleagues can
continue to safely and prudently grow loans.
The rationale behind this merger of equals was and is relatively straightforward, as I stated several times. We
have created a company with an incredibly diverse funding profile, including our HSA Bank franchise. We have a
proven track record of growing loans across a broad set of asset classes and geographies at or above market
growth rates. With a bigger balance sheet to deepen our relationships with existing sponsors and businesses, we
materially improve our ability to drive net interest income, capital markets revenue and swap and cash
management fees. In 2Q, we saw early proof points validating the power of combining the two companies.
On slide 3, while we continue with key milestones and the integration, our colleagues also remain laser focused
on our clients and maintaining the day to day operations of the bank and revenue momentum. Our ability to do
both was evident in this quarter. We remain confident in our ability to achieve or exceed the key merger financial
metrics we set forth at the announcement over a year ago, including 8% to 10% annual loan growth, $120 million
in expense saves over the first two years and completion of our technology conversion by mid-2023.
While we continue to manage expenses and look for synergistic opportunities, we remain focused on profitable
growth and will not shy away from investments in our differentiated, high return businesses that will add franchise
value and economic profit over time. We continue to see opportunities to attract key talent and launch initiatives
across all of our high performing business lines. In the second quarter, we began to consolidate several back
office systems, including mortgage servicing, treasury management and payroll. We finalized the structure of our
executive management team and we're making great progress on the corporate office consolidations we outlined
last quarter.
Finally, given our increased scale, we have been able to formally establish an Office of Corporate Responsibility
to oversee the company's community investments, philanthropy efforts and sustainability work. Collectively, we
have the ability to provide more for our communities. In the quarter, we announced a $6.5 billion three-year
community investment program that includes investment in affordable housing and community development,
small business lending, and other philanthropic and community engagement efforts.
With that, I'm going to turn over to Glenn to review our financial performance for the quarter.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I will start with the reconciliation of core earnings on slide 4. We've
reported GAAP net income to common shareholders of $178 million with EPS of $1. As John noted, on an
adjusted basis, we reported net income to common shareholders of $229 million, an EPS of a $1.29, which
excluded one-time after tax expenses of $50 million. The one-time charges were related to real estate
consolidation, severance and other merger and integration charges.
Next I'll review the balance sheet trends before moving on to the income statement. On slide 5, our total assets
were $67.6 billion, with total loans of $45.6 billion and total deposits of $53.1 billion. As you see, we delivered
strong loan growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis in commercial and consumer categories. The linked quarter
decline in deposits was primarily due to seasonal effects of public funds, which I'll cover in more detail on a later
slide.
On slide 6, we highlight the diversity of our loan growth, which is an illustration of the potential of Webster's post-
merger business mix. In total, we grew loans $2.1 billion or 4.8% on a linked quarter basis. By category, the
largest contributors to the increase were C&I with $603 million, commercial real estate with $557 million and
residential mortgages with $426 million.
Switching to the deposits on slide 7, total deposit balances declined by $1.3 billion or 2.4% relative to prior
quarter. The primary driver was a seasonal decline in public funds, with balances down $1.2 billion. We expect to
see a reversal in the third quarter as tax collections drive higher liquidity at public entities. Short-term borrowings
were leveraged to fund growth in the quarter. A portion of the borrowings will be paid down as public funds
rebuild, and we continue to gather new deposits. HSA deposits were effectively flat on a quarter and up 6.2%
year-over-year. Excluding third-party administrative accounts, deposits increased 8.4% year-over-year. The
impact of TPA run off and an overall growth is becoming much less significant, as that book nears an end state.
Additional detail for the HSA Bank is on slide 19 in the appendix.
Beginning on slide 8, I'll review the details of our income statement. We provided our reported to adjusted income
statement by line item and compared our adjusted earnings to pro forma first quarter earnings. Notably, on an
adjusted basis each of the major line items of our income statement exhibited improvement on a quarter-over-
quarter basis when compared to the aggregated results of Sterling and Webster last quarter. I'll cover the
individual line items in more detail in subsequent slides. Our pre-provision net revenue on adjusted basis was
$316 million, up $39 million when compared to the combined first quarter results. Net interest margin was 3.28%
on a reported basis and our combined efficiency ratio is now 45%.
On slide 9, net interest income grew by $22.8 million relative to the pro forma first quarter. Adjusting for accretion
in both periods, net interest income was up $29.9 million quarter-over-quarter. Net interest margin excluding
accretion income increased 11 basis points to 3.09%. Given the current forward curve, we expect further
expansion to our core net interest margin throughout the year. As illustrated on an earlier slide, the cost of
deposits increased 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We expect deposit pricing in certain categories will start to
move more materially in the future quarters with subsequent Fed actions. On a year-over-year basis, deposit
costs were flat.
On slide 10, we show our fee income for the quarter and on a year-over-year basis. Fees were up $6 million
linked quarter and $18 million year-over-year. The improvement in fee income was driven primarily by customer
interest rate hedging activity in the commercial bank. Year-over-year improvement was also driven by increased
deposit related fees as transaction activity increased relative to pandemic impacted periods.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Slide 11 summarizes non-interest expense. We reported adjusted expense of $292 million relative to $302 million
on adjusted pro forma expense last quarter. The decline is driven by the initiatives John outlined in his integration
updates, including the finalization of the board structure, corporate real estate consolidation, and the elimination
of duplicate systems and vendors.
Slide 12 highlights our allowance for credit losses, where we reported provision expense of $12 million and a $2
million increase in our allowance, driven by loan growth. The provision expense also reflects an improvement in
individual credit performance and loan mix, which was partially offset by a modestly lower outlook on
macroeconomic variables. As a result, the allowance coverage ratio fell as a percent of loans to 1.25%.
As highlighted on slide 13, you can see the underlying credit metrics remained strong. We reported linked quarter
declines in both non-performing assets and classified loans, down $1 million and $41 million, respectively. I would
also note our delinquencies declined to $52 million from $71 million last quarter. Net charge-offs of 9 basis points
declined 1 basis point from last quarter and remained at low levels.
Slide 14 highlights our strong capital levels. All capital ratios remained well in excess of regulatory and internal
targets. Consistent with our previously stated capital targets, we repurchased over 2 million shares in the quarter
and we'll continue to be opportunistic with repurchases going forward. The net of all capital effects this quarter
resulted in a slight decline in our tangible book value per share, which decreased to $28.31 primarily driven by
AOCI losses, the share repurchases, partially offset by our strong earnings.
Our common equity Tier 1 ratio remained strong at 11.04%, it's still well above our minimum term operating target
of 10.5%. We anticipate we will prudently and opportunistically return capital to shareholders, given the strong
internal capital generation from improving profitability, sound underwriting credit metrics and the ample reserve on
our marked and well diligenced loan portfolio.
I'll wrap up my comments with a refresh on our outlook for the full year 2022. We are increasing our guidance on
net interest income to $1.9 billion, driven by our projections for the rate environment and strong loan growth. This
full year outlook excludes $90 million of realized and scheduled purchase accounting accretion, the details of
which can be found on slide 28 in the appendix. Our projections assume the Fed funds rate ends the year at
3.25%, implying another 150 basis points of rate increases. And as a reminder, our interest income outlook is on
a non-FTE basis.
We now expect loan growth to be near the top end of our 8% to 10% range. Fee should be in the range of $430
million to $450 million. We continue to feel confident in achieving our full year adjusted expense target of $1.1
billion to $1.12 billion. That being said, we will continue to monitor inflationary headwinds and of course, continue
to invest in our businesses. And we are forecasting an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%.
With that, I'll turn things back over to John for closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Glenn. Five months after closing our merger, we've made material progress. While we have a ton of work
in front of us bringing systems, products and processes together, we are operating as one organization, and the
strategic merits of bringing the two companies together is reflected in our accomplishments so far this year.
We've created a bank with growth capabilities and unique asset classes. Our commercial loan portfolio has grown
12% year-to-date on an annualized basis. We have a bank with a unique funding engine, our deposit cost

increased 2 basis points this quarter, at the same time, the Fed is increasing short-term rates at a fast pace.
We've created a bank with superior capital generation capability. The adjusted return on tangible common equity
of over 18% this quarter illustrates the potential we have to deliver outsized returns. And we have repurchased
over $200 million in Webster shares since the transaction closed, all while maintaining capital levels that provide
us with significant flexibility as we move forward.
Finally, I do want to address the operating environment and our preparedness. As many of our peers have
remarked, things feel good on the ground today, despite tangible macro headwinds and an increased risk of
recession. We have maintained a consistent and prudent risk management framework that will serve us well in
any economic environment. Specifically, as it relates to credit, our loan portfolio is diverse with the merger actually
serving to eliminate concentrations in asset classes, businesses and geographies. I'm very pleased with how
quickly we have been able to consolidate and harmonize portfolio management practices across the new
organization. And in fact, we plan to consolidate our credit risk management tech platform in the third quarter.
We have a robust allowance for loan losses with coverage in the top quartile of our proxy peer group. We have
benefited from internal and third-party diligence on our loan portfolio associated with merger work last year. We
incurred purchase accounting marks on the loan book. We have significant buffers in our capital ratios well above
regulatory minimums and our company should continue to generate substantial excess capital moving forward.
We believe that this provides us significant flexibility to adapt to the constantly changing operating environment.
In short, we believe our strength position the company to operate through macro cycle and generate solid returns
to shareholders in both the near- and long-term. We believe this was a very strong quarter for us Webster and it's
a direct result of the hard work and great execution of our colleagues, all during the challenging process of
integrating in MOE. I want to give a big thanks to all of our colleagues and their tremendous efforts.
Operator, Glenn and I will now take questions.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris McGratty with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh. Hey, good morning. Glenn, maybe I just start with you on the balance sheet, I appreciate the comments on
the public forums. I guess a trend that we've all noticed this quarter is just the challenge of growing deposits. And
I'm interested in kind of outlook commentary about retention of deposits, what you might see in the portfolio that
could be at risk and how we should be thinking about funding improved growth? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Great. Good question, Chris. So, here's how we're thinking about it, so we're up [ph] $53.1 billion
(00:16:51) in deposits. We mentioned the public funds, which are about $1.2 billion, we think that's seasonality, so
that will come back to us. But as we talked about in the past, I mean, we have multiple levers to pull on the
funding side, whether it's digital or commercial. And so, we think that will begin to attract new funds in those two
channels and some of that will be partially off. If you look at things like our DDA balance as a percent of total
deposits are elevated, because of all the liquidity. We're factoring some of that coming down, but at the end of the
day, we think, if you put it all together, we're still targeting a loan to deposit ratio somewhere around 85%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And in terms of the investment portfolio, is it fair to assume that kind of gradually works lower, as you kind
of find more profitable ways to...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, $15 billion, it's about 25% of our earning assets. And so, over time, over the course of time, primarily
through prepayments and cash flow, we think that it probably drift down to like a 20% level, but that's probably
going to take some time to get there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Maybe just the last one I'll hop back, the abated, can you just remind me what you're assuming for through
the cycle betas on the combined company?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So, look I think over the next four quarters, we would think are effective data on a full, full deposit base would be
closer to 30%. And that takes into effect the fact that we're capturing new deposits from the various channels that
we have. So, that's how we're thinking of it. You'll recall last quarter, we were about 21%. We now have another
quarter underneath us. And so, we're thinking that over a four-quarter process, it'll probably be close to 30%.

Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Mark. How you're doing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good. Thanks. I wondered if you could first share with us your commercial line utilization rates, what those look
like right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. They're improving marginally, so up – in March, they were up about 2%, in June they were up about 8%.
So, we're seeing from June – from last June, they're up about 8%. From the prior quarter they're up about 3%. So,
we're seeing that across the board. I think that's kind of consistent with industry and we're seeing it in ABL, where
we kind of see the best sign of working capital changes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then, secondly, John we saw a small HAS bucket sold to a competitor recently. I'm curious if these
kinds of deals continue to be a priority for Webster. And whether you think, it's likely in the quarters ahead we'll
see some of these kinds of transactions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, Mark, I think that's a great question and we've been pretty transparent about it. Obviously, as a top five
player and you know that top five own 65% of the market. We obviously see all the transactions, the pricing and
the value on many of these transactions are pretty steep. So, I would say, yes, it's a priority to us. You saw us do
the Bend acquisition, which was a combination of a portfolio and technology that we can lever. But we're also
trying to be disciplined with respect to tangible book value dilution and balancing it against the cost of acquiring
other deposits. So, the answer is, yes, it is a significant priority. You've seen deals go up in the market and price
has generally been the reason we haven't won some of those transactions.

Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then lastly, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about your franchise footprint and maybe which
geographies you see us having the best growth potential and maybe areas where you might look to prune?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure, Mark. This always sounds like a punk answer, but the truth is, I felt this quarter was really, really
evidenced of all lenders kind of working at the same time. And so, you think about the concentrations legacy
Sterling in New York City, Sponsor & Specialty at Webster, commercial real estate in some areas, and so, this
was a broad quarter of loan growth and we're seeing strength in activity in all areas. So, what I would say is,
geographically, both in our core retail footprint, core middle market footprint, in more of our regional businesses
like commercial real estate, or even national businesses like public sector finance, or Sponsor & Specialty, we
see real opportunity and we don't see any geographic areas where we're concerned or looking to pull back.
I would say, it's more in the asset classes where we're being a little bit more careful. Cyclical businesses,
businesses that are potentially at risk to higher energy prices, cyclicality, supply chain disruption, office, right,
we're obviously looking keenly as to whether or not there's a real paradigm shift going on there with the way
people work. So, I would say, it's more industry sector, more borrower specific than any geography. And right
now, beside a couple of those areas where we're keeping an eye on and probably reducing new origination in
office, in some of the more cyclical businesses, all of our geographies are still robust and healthy.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
You're saying you have a more diverse deposit base which is fine, but which categories should we expect going
forward to support and fund loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, I think it's a mix, Steven. And so, you get some of the texture we've gone from like a loan to deposit
ratio of 80% to 86% this quarter and about 4% of that was driven by the loan growth, 2% from the decline in
municipal deposits of public funds, and we do expect that to come back and pretty strong for the back part of the
year. I think the key channels for us are going to be on digital and they're going to be in the commercial business,
whether it's treasury management or whether it's transactional type of accounts.
We will have the natural – over the course of the four quarters, we'll have HSA coming in too, as we get into the
enrollment season. And so, I have a lot of pluses coming in from the multiple channels, but I also have an offset in
DDA, because I think it's sort of elevated right now. With the combination of all those, I think, it's what's going to
bring us today 85% loan to deposit ratio.
That being said, as you can see from the first quarter, I mean, we did raise or increase what we think our
forecasted deposit beta is going to be over four quarters. So, now when we thought last quarter was going to be
21%, we're starting to see things heat up a little bit more, but that doesn't mean that this is an expensive source of
funding on the deposit side. But we've moved that 21% closer to 30% over a four-quarter cycle. So, that's how
we're thinking about it right now. And it's all to fund the loan growth, which we feel, as you saw in this quarter, we
feel really confident about where we are and operating at the top end of our stated range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Steve, I'll just put context from a business perspective as well. As Glenn mentioned, the vast majority of the
reduction in deposits was seasonal outflows from public sector and government deposits. We're adding, as you
can see, 4.8% loan growth, also a lot of new logos, a lot of new companies, a lot of new relationships in business
banking and commercial and we really require our teams out there to make sure those are full relationships with
deposits and cash management.
So, you'll see more deposits roll in and have a natural growth in commercial, because of the number of
relationships, maybe not because of what's going on in the macro environment from a liquidity perspective. But
Chris Motl is out there right now, making sure that his folks are focused on deposits and we can refine our pricing
a bit to make sure that we're able to continue to raise deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. And the last thing I would add, Steve, is that our investment portfolio as you know is elevated right now,
25%. We think the more natural level, more investment [ph] for growth (00:25:48) is probably closer to 20%. And
so, as we'll get the cash flow out of the investment portfolio, which is running about $350 million a quarter, that's
going to go into the fund to loan growth as well. And so that will take some time to come off, but we're basically
picking up 140 basis points, 150 basis points on that trade as it flows more into the loan book.

Okay. That's helpful. I'd like to shift direction and talk about HSA Bank for a minute. So, if I look at the year-over-
year growth metrics, this basically went from one of your fastest growing segments, if not the fastest growing
segment to one of the slowest, even after I adjust for the third-party administration stuff. How much of the
downshift do you see as structural versus cyclical? And what's the environment we need to transform this again
into a growth engine for the company?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I think that's a great question, Steve, and you know that we're focused on it because we think it's a terrific asset.
So, I think if you cut through, we're really pleased with the performance in terms of on the ground execution in
winning RFPs and going after direct to employer relationships. And the data that we show say that we do a really
good job there kind of at market. Some of our bigger relationships with healthcare providers have grown a little bit
slower than market. So, the net result of all of that is the whole market, the HSA industry has slowed, obviously,
from kind of that 20% growth rate, more towards high single digits, low teens and we've been trailing that by a
couple of percentage points, given the mix of our business.
So, it has slowed. I think the drivers are much more industry world-wide and we're obviously growing the deposit
at 8% year-over-year is still a wonderful thing, particularly with the characteristics of the long duration and low
cost nature of those deposits. So, one of the things we're doing, Steve, the Bend acquisition, we are right now
integrating that technology with our own customer portal and we're rolling that out to clients as we speak over the
next six months and in beta testing, our customers and our employees really like that. We think that will increase
participation and increase funding amount, providing the great digital experience and education to our existing 3
million plus account holders about why they should be savers and not spenders. And we think that there will be a
material uplift in average deposits.
So, we're kind of working everything. We're working transparency tools, products, we're working better technology
experience, we're focused on sales and so, our goal is to be able to come to the market and say we're growing at
market rates. And as it relates to the market, we do think coming out of the pandemic that we'll see a
strengthening of that kind of market industry growth rate as well. So, we want to make sure when that happens
that we can be a strong participant.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And if I could ask one final one, John, big picture question. Talk to us about how the
integration of the two cultures is going, what's going well, what needs more attention, I know you haven't done the
system conversion yet, but how has the customer experience been thus far? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. I'll start with your last question. The customer experience has been really, really good, because we haven't
disrupted anything really from an operational perspective. So, because this deal was so complementary, all of our
frontline folks are here, all of our customers are dealing with the same people they were dealing with and I think
that's one of the reasons we were able to kind of beat market growth on loan. So, customer experience so far
good. One of the reasons why we are having our technology conversion in mid-2023 is because we are
determined not to disrupt our customers. And I think that's why we're taking a slower and more deliberate
approach.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
As it relates to culture, if I sat here right now five months after closing at a transaction, I give us kind of in A, A-
minus, and I'm really happy. I can't believe we would be better off, with respect to alignment at the top with the
management team, the way we're cascading messaging down. All that being said, an MOE is hard, and so the
idea of making sure that every last one of our 4,000 colleagues feels as if they're part of one singular team, takes
a lot of hard work, a lot of purposeful training, but it also takes time. And so, I'd be lying to you if I told you that if
you walked around our entire organization, everyone would feel like this was the place they worked in for the last
20 years.
So, we're working really hard at that, and so far it's worked really well, we've got great alignment. People are
executing, our risk framework is great, our relationships, the regulators are great. We have not seen attrition in
key areas. So, I couldn't be more pleased. But I'm also, I don't have my head in the sand and I know that it's a
long road to get to the perfect spot.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Just thinking about the loan growth guide versus what you've already accomplished year-to-date. Is the 8% to
10% growth range, is that a safe annualized rate from here or should we incorporate, the tremendous amount of
growth you've already seen?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Well, I mean, we're looking at it incorporating the growth. I'm not sure we can put up another 4.8% organic growth
rate. So, look, Glenn guided to the high end of that range. There's a chance we could outperform it, if the
environment stays strong. The reason we've always talked about that 8% to 10% and we go back and forth on
12

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
people telling us, we'll never make it and then telling us it's too much and then figuring out whether or not we're
going to go above that is I think we've been able to sustainably grow our loans, particularly on the commercial
side. And now, we're getting good traction on the consumer side as well in that 8% to 10% range.
So, I think what you can do, Matt, is push that out into 2023 as well. So, I think, we're looking every quarter to try
and post an 8% to 10% annualized growth rate. Some quarters will be higher and lower depending on
prepayments and certain origination characteristics. But we're not saying we're going to grow loans another 10%
in the next six months. We're saying that we're sticking to our 8% to 10% loan growth range for the year, but
obviously, we have an opportunity to be at the high end of the range or outperform.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. And the way the pipeline looks, does it seem like growth can be as diverse as it was this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
You know it does right now and I kind of say that with a smile. Yeah. I'm thrilled, because it appears that the
teams across this franchise and the different asset classes have a lot of energy and their pipelines are healthy.
And I think we're being really disciplined, Matt, on risk selection as well, I think we're understanding pockets of
asset classes that could be vulnerable to a downturn and I think we're being disciplined in making sure we're not
reaching too far from the bottom in any one area. So, we still see broad growth. We had broad growth in
commercial real estate, middle market, Sponsor & Specialty, public sector finance, ABL and all of our mortgage
and consumer lending, all really kind of in that 4% plus area. So, it was really nice to see the granular growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. And then, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the banking-as-a-service effort at Webster and what
was brought over from legacy Sterling, what that entails. Curious, the amount of deposits it's important to the
overall funding effort and the outlook for growth. I guess I didn't fully appreciate how important that was towards
the end days of Sterling, and I'm curious if that's going to be one of the primary drivers of deposit growth as we
head deeper into this rate hike cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
It's a great question. And as you can tell probably from Glenn's earlier response on deposits we are not sort of
factoring that in as a major driver in the next couple of quarters, although we do see a clear path to $1 billion
pipeline in that area of relatively low cost deposits with existing relationships that we're working with. So, what I'd
say is, that's kind of gravy on our plate. It is what we believe to be another strategic lever that hopefully will kind of
have operational for a period of time. And so, I think that what we're saying is, it's not a major driver of deposit
growth over the next quarter or two, but it could be significant.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then my last one, I noticed that ABL NPAs increased a bit quarter-over-quarter. Looks like some of it
transitioned from 30- to 89-day, obviously not a huge number, but I am focused on equipment lending near-term
as an area that could see some stress across the industry. So, I'm just curious, could you give us some
background on the combined equipment book, the exposures, the types of equipment you underwrite, historical
13

losses? And then just an overall sense for how that book is shaping up from a stress perspective in this
environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think we're not too concerned right now, because we've got pretty good collateral coverage. It's an
interesting, bringing these two equipment finance businesses together, there's almost everything there, Matt. So,
there's granular low ticket stuff that's volume-based. There's also participations in larger banks, larger
transactions and equipment finance. So, I think some more cyclical businesses, as you can imagine. There's
nothing in there from a kind of a systemic perspective that scares us with respect to kind of credit performance
right now.
And as you can see, we really haven't grown the business. We're kind of putting over a new framework on how
we're going to attack the market and we've kind of been slowly trying to build back up originations in profitable
and granular areas. So, all I can say right now, it hasn't been a big driver of growth. We're not particularly
concerned, given the collateralized nature of the business and kind of outsized loss in the portfolio and more to
come on kind of strategically how we move forward with that combined business.

Question if – it's sort of a bigger question, if we could say on loan and credit here. Can you give us a refresh on
your leverage loan book? And then, how much of that is in the Sponsor & Specialty areas, just with respect to
balanced credit charge-offs and more importantly, with the warning signals starting to flash how you're thinking
about that? And just remind us how it's different versus where you sat during the GFC?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
How much time do we have, Laurie? No, I'm only kidding. Good question. So, I'll give you the kind of the fun facts.
So, our leveraged loans, end of period balances were around $3 billion, representing 6.5% of total loans and
about 8% of commercial loans as of June 30, which is roughly in line from a percentage perspective with what it's
historically been. And as you know, when we talked about merger, one of the wonderful things is, it reduced the
overall concentration in the numbers with a bigger balance sheet and bigger loans.
I will tell you that the portfolio of leverage loans is about 85% to 90% in the Sponsor & Specialty world, which is
good news, because it's in industries and sectors that have repeatable, protectable, sustainable cash flows.
Those are tech and infrastructure, healthcare services, stuff that we've been doing for a long time with sponsors
we've known for 15 or 20 years. The portfolio continues to perform at or around the overall performance level of
the rest of the commercial banks, which had been the case through both the Great Recession and the pandemic.
There is a little bit more volatility in the risk ratings in the leverage book, because obviously those risk ratings start
a little bit lower and with leverage, there can be a little more variability in risk rating, however, the strength of the
financial sponsors behind the deals have continued to have that not result in higher levels of non-accruals or
losses. The other thing I'll say about the book is, it's more granular. So, if you think about the leveraged loans
making up 8% of the commercial loan book, they only make up about 3.5% of our aggregate exposure in top 100
exposures and names.
So, if you think about that, our leverage loans tend not to be the highest commitments in single point exposures in
the organization and that's obviously intentional. So, we'll keep you posted. But so far our premise has worked
really well and we've also been disciplined about where we do that activity, about the people who we allow to do
that activity and how much of that activity is in the organization as a percentage of Tier 1 capital plus reserves for
the overall portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Great. Thanks. And do you have what your balance of non-performers is relative to that $3 billion book and what
charge-offs are? And then I just have one more quick follow up. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I don't have those numbers off base, but little to no loss in that book I know over the last five years. But we
can reach back out to you over that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Great. Thanks. And then just one last question, office, can you remind us what is the balance that you have in
office and how much of that is in New York City? [ph] Thanks. That's all (00:40:03) my question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. We have about $2.2 billion in office exposure all around. If you take $550,000, $600,000 of office, medical
related office, which has a completely different characteristic, you're about down to $1.6 billion or so, split half
between Class A and Class B and C, underwritten at 50% LTVs, obviously, those are at underwriting. So, those
LTVs have probably moved up a bit depending on what your view of value is there with a 1.7 times average debt
service coverage. About $522 million of that exposure is in New York City in the five boroughs. If you take out
15

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
medical office again, it's about $400 million in traditional office in the five boroughs, and it is performing from a
classified watch and ward to non-performer, similar to the office exposure across the rest of our footprint, which I
would say is slightly worse than the overall commercial weighted average risk rating and levels of classified and
criticized.
So, that's where we are. It's a relatively small portion. We spend a lot of time on it, as you can imagine. The other
good news there is, we have less than 10% of rent rolls rolling off in each of the next two years, which means that
there's probably sometime before real issues, if there really is a permanent paradigm shift arise and it gives us
some time to work with the borrowers on those properties.

Operator: Our next question comes from Bernie Horn with Polaris Capital Management. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard R. Horn Q
Analyst, Polaris Capital Management, LLC
Hi. Good morning. I had a quick question on just general tone of the portfolio or the behavior of borrowers. We've
heard from some sectors, companies that we're speaking to and even some borrowers in the PE space that some
of their borrowers are getting very cautious about the future of the economy to the point where they're actually
trying to sell off some assets to pay down debt. So, I guess the question is, are you seeing – it seems like you're
going in a very heavy into the growth mode potentially before a big economic crisis? I'm not saying it's huge, but I
guess the point is that some borrowers are out there getting more conservative, are you seeing any of that type of
behavior in new borrowers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Bernie, I think in some sectors we are, absolutely. And as portfolio managers, we're doing the same thing.
If we have opportunities because there's still a lot of private liquidity out there to lower areas in our loan book that
we think might be vulnerable in the long-term, we're taking actions as well. So, I don't want you to get the sense
that we're not in full preparedness mode, the potential number of outcomes here is wide. Our base case is still, if
there is a recession, it's relatively mild in terms of impact on broad credit. But we obviously know that there could
be a worse downturn.
So, as I said earlier, all of our origination, we're not pedal down, meaning that it's loan growth at all costs. We're
taking care of our borrowers in the geographies and sectors in our existing relationships, and opportunities we
should, but we're trying to avoid like in real estate, we're cautious in hotel, we're cautious and really not doing
anything in the office right now. And so, there are property types we're focused on where our growth is,
multifamily, industrial distribution, which is still pretty healthy. And in C&I, I'd say, we're really careful about
cyclical contractors, we're careful about folks that are exposed to energy costs, transportation costs who've been
significantly impacted by supply chain disruption who've been impacted actually by labor shortages and with tight
labor markets.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
So, what we do is, we don't put a blanket on everything and put out the red light or the yellow light. But our credit
folks who are just terrific, Jason Soto, our Chief Credit Officer and his team, they're well aware of where there is
more vulnerability. And it's coming through, I think, in our risk selection, which is why a little bit we're not
projecting the same level of loan growth for the balance of the year. We still think there will be decent loan
demand, but we think as we move closer to whatever this cycle is, that there'll be less demand because our
borrowers will be more cautious, and so are we.

where you're being cautious with. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
