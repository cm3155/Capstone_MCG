Phillip D. Green
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, A.B. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review fourth quarter results for
Cullen/Frost and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, will also provide additional comments before we open
it up to your questions.
In the fourth quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $88.3 million or $1.38 a share compared with earnings of $101.7 million
or $1.60 a share reported in the same quarter last year, and $95.1 million or $1.50 a share in the third quarter of
2020. For the full-year 2020, Cullen/Frost earned $323.6 million or $5.10 a share compared with earnings of
$435.5 million or $6.84 a share reported for 2019.
Our team continues to manage expenses while, at the same time, pursuing the expansion of market share and
investing for long-term growth. Overall, average loans in the fourth quarter were $17.9 billion, an increase of 22%
compared with $14.7 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. But excluding PPP loans, fourth quarter average
loans of $15 billion represented a 2.3% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
Average deposits in the fourth quarter were $34 billion, an increase of 25% compared with the $27 billion in the
fourth quarter of last year. For the second consecutive quarter, we've seen the highest quarterly average deposits
in our history. This growth reflects that Frost has always been a safe haven for customers in times of uncertainty
and also our success in building new relationships.
Our return on average assets and average common equity in the fourth quarter was 86 basis points and 8.55%,
respectively. We saw a reduction in our credit loss expense to $13.8 million in the fourth quarter, down from $20.3
million in the third quarter of 2020, and this compared to $8.4 million in the fourth quarter of last year.
Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were $13.6 million compared with $10.2 million in the third quarter.
Annualized net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were 30 basis points of average loans. Non-performing assets
were only $62.3 million at year-end, down 35% from the $96.4 million at the end of the third quarter. A year ago,
non-performers stood at $109.5 million.
Overall delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the fourth quarter were $103 million or 59 basis points of
period-end loans. Those numbers will remain within our standards and comparable to what we've experienced in
the last several years.
Regarding payment deferrals, in total, we've granted 90-day deferrals to more than 2,500 customers for loans
totaling $2.2 billion. And at the end of the fourth quarter, only about $46 million remained in deferment. Total
problem loans, which we define as risk grade 10 and higher, were $812 million at the end of the fourth quarter, in
line with the $803 million at the end of the third.
Energy-related problem loans were $133.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter compared to $203.7 million for
the previous quarter and $132.4 million for the fourth quarter of last year. To put that in perspective, total problem
energy loans peaked at nearly $600 million early in 2016. Energy loans continue to decline as a percentage of our
portfolio, falling to 8.2% of our non-PPP portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter. As a reminder, that figure was
9.1% at the end of the third quarter and the peak was 16% back in 2015. We continue to work hard to rationalize
our company's exposure to the energy segment to appropriate levels.
Throughout 2020, the pandemic's economic impacts on our portfolio were negative but manageable, and our
overall outlook for credit quality is stable to improving. In the second half of 2020, we discussed the non-energy
3

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
portfolio segments that have had an increased impact from the economic dislocations brought on by the
pandemic; restaurants, hotels, entertainment and sports, and retail. A total of these portfolio segments, excluding
PPP loans, represented just under $1.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and our loan loss reserve for these
segments was 4.55%.
We saw the largest reserve increases in hotels and restaurants, where our allocated allowances as a percentage
of outstanding balances are now 9.1% and 7.4%, respectively. We continue to monitor credit in these areas
closely and we will have a good â€“ and we have a good handle on our risk. And as a reminder, hotels and lodging
represent approximately 1.9% of our total loans and restaurants represent approximately 1.8% of our total loans.
To me, a really bright spot is the growth in our commercial relationships in 2020. They were up by 31% compared
to a year ago. We're great at building relationships. It's what we do. It's in our mission statement. But clearly, for
us, national recognition with success in going above and beyond to obtain PPP loans for its customers had a
positive impact in the market.
In addition, our Houston expansion is also contributing to our success here. New commercial relationships in
Houston grew 49% in 2020 and represented 39% of the new commercial relationships company-wide during the
year.
For the year, our loan commitments booked were down 65% compared to the prior year and reflected the impact
of the pandemic. Regarding new loan commitments booked, the balance between these relationships has stayed
steady at 53% larger and 47% core at the end of 2020. The market remains very competitive.
The percentage of deals lost to structure increased from 61% this time last year to 67% this year. Our weighted
current active loan pipeline in the fourth quarter dropped by about 2% compared with the end of the third quarter,
reflecting the continued impact of the pandemic on business activity.
Consumer banking continues to see good growth. Overall, our net new customer growth for the fourth quarter was
up 57% compared to the pre-COVID fourth quarter of 2019. Same-store sales is measured by account openings
or branches opened less than a year were up by 2.2% though the end of the fourth quarter when compared to the
fourth quarter 2019, and up 8.2% compared to the prior quarter.
Here, again, our Houston expansion is helping this growth. For example, despite currently representing only about
16% of our total consumer households, Houston contributed 34% of fourth quarter total company consumer
household growth. In the fourth quarter, 41% of our account openings came from our online channel, including
our Frost mobile app. Online account openings were 39.5% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The
consumer loan portfolio was up $1.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up by 7.2% compared to the fourth
quarter last year.
Our Houston expansion is nearing completion, with two new financial centers opened in the fourth quarter, for a
total of 22 of the 25 planned new financial centers. COVID has had an impact on our rollout, but we expect to
open the remaining three in the first half of this year. Overall, the new financial centers are exceeding our
expectations and the new locations were well-placed and well-timed to leverage our success in obtaining PPP
loans for the market.
The fourth quarter also saw the opening of our new financial center in College Station, with a second financial
center to open in nearby Bryan later this quarter. So far, in January, our newest location in Dallas, the Red Bird
Financial Center location, also opened for business. We remain committed to consistent, sustainable, above

average organic growth. We also remain committed to managing cost and operating as efficiently as possible.
This month, we took the difficult step of eliminating 68 positions across the company where business needs have
changed, where technology could be better utilized, and where responsibilities could be consolidated. This, along
with broadly successful efforts to improve efficiency, which Jerry will discuss, positioned us well as we move into
2021.
I talk often about the dedication skill of Frost Bankers and about their commitment to the Frost philosophy and
culture. Throughout a difficult 2020 and now into a new year that promises to be challenging in its own way, the
people of Frost have been and will be ready to provide the level of world-class customer service Frost is known
for. I'm thankful for them. I'm proud of what we've accomplished, and I'm optimistic about the long-term well-being
of the company and the communities we serve.
Now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas for some additional comments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. Looking first at our net interest margin. Our net interest margin percentage for the fourth quarter
was 2.82%, down 13 basis points from the 2.95% reported last quarter. The decrease was almost all a result of a
higher proportion of earning assets being invested in lower-yielding balances at the Fed in the fourth quarter as
compared to the third quarter. Interest-bearing deposits at the Fed earning 10 basis points averaged $7.7 billion
or 20% of our earning assets in the fourth quarter, up from $5.9 billion or 16% of earning assets in the third
quarter.
The taxable equivalent loan yield for the fourth quarter was 3.74%, up 1 basis point from the previous quarter.
Average loan volumes in the fourth quarter of $17.9 billion were down $205 million from the third quarter average
of $18.1 billion. The decrease was driven by a decrease of $296 million and average PPP loans as a result of
those balances being forgiven. Excluding PPP loans, average loans in the fourth quarter were up about $92
million or 2.4% on an annualized basis from last quarter.
Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged $12.6 billion during the fourth quarter,
down about $98 million from the third quarter average of $12.7 billion. The taxable equivalent yield on the
investment portfolio was 3.41% in the fourth quarter, down 3 basis points from the third quarter. The lower
portfolio yield was driven by a decrease in the yield in our taxable portfolio. The yield on that portfolio, which
averaged $4.2 billion during the quarter, was down 9 basis points from the third quarter to 2.12% as a result of
higher premium amortization associated with our agency MBS securities given faster prepayment speeds and
lower yields associated with recent purchases.
Our municipal portfolio averaged about $8.4 billion during the fourth quarter, down $95 million from the third
quarter, with a taxable equivalent yield of 4.09%, up 1 basis point from the prior quarter. At the end of the fourth
quarter, 78% of the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF-insured. The duration of the investment portfolio
at the end of fourth quarter was 4.4 years compared to 4.5 years last quarter.
During the fourth quarter, our investment purchases were less than $100 million and consistent primarily of MBS
securities. As we look out into 2021, we currently are not expecting to make a significant amount of investment
purchases in this market.
We are currently only expecting to make purchases in the neighborhood of about $1 billion which will help to
offset a portion of our maturities and expected prepayments in calls.

Regarding non-interest expense: for the fourth quarter, I'll point out that non-interest expense includes about $7.1
million in one-time restructuring costs with $5.2 million of that related to severance impacted by the eliminated
positions Phil noted.
As we mentioned last quarter, and as Phil mentioned in his comments, in this environment, we continue to focus
on managing our discretionary spending and looking for ways to operate more efficiently. We have worked and
continue to work in a collaborative manner across our organization to look for ways to operate more efficiently
without affecting our customer experience.
We challenged ourselves to eliminate open positions where possible and reorganized operating areas including
using technology where it makes sense to further automate processes. We use a thoughtful process to reorganize
positions where the business needs have changed, where technology could be better utilized, and where
responsibilities could be consolidated.
We asked our teammates to question discretionary spending and visited with vendor relationships to reduce costs
where we could. All this was done without losing sight of our core values of integrity, caring and excellence. We
believe that we have always been prudent in managing expenses. But in this zero rate environment, our approach
has become even more focused. We began this process in the.
second quarter of last year as we began to deal with the challenges of the pandemic and a zero interest rate
environment. Our initial guidance for expense growth for 2020 was around 10.5% and we actually ended up with
a growth rate of under 2% on reported non-interest expenses to 2020 over 2019. Obviously, the changes resulting
from the operating environment and lower incentives affected the decrease somewhat. But overall, it shows our
team's commitment to managing expenses in this environment.
Now, looking forward into to 2021, we expect an annual expense growth of something around the 4% to 4.5%
range growth off of our 2020 total reported non-interest expenses. Regarding income taxes, we currently expect
our effective tax rate for 2021 to be a little higher than our 2020 effective tax rate of 5.7%. Just as a reminder,
2020 income tax expense included a discrete one-time credit of $2.6 million. Regarding the estimates for full-year
2021 earnings, we currently believe that the current mean of analyst estimates of $4.72 is a little low. This
assumes a steady operating environment with no unexpected credit event.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brady Gailey with KBW. Your line is
now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Brady.

Hey, Brady.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So I wanted to start with the PPP loans. I know some of those got forgiven in the fourth quarter. What was the
dollar amount of spread income impact from PPP in the fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Give me a second here. I'll say that, the fee portion I know was around â€“ let me grab it here just so I don't
have to give you any false information â€“ it was about $19 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And I know you guys were pretty successful in round 1 of the PPP. There's over $100 million of earnings, if
I remember right. What about round 2? I know it's early, but any idea how big that could be at across round 2 of
PPP?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Brady, we're seeing really good volume. Our people worked around the clock once the SBA gave us the
information about how we'd be integrating with them. And it was a new system front-end. I think we have about 10
days to stand up our portal and our processes. And it was â€“ we have so far gotten, well, let's see, it's the â€“ the
piece paper I have right now has over 7,000 applications. I think earlier today I got one, maybe 7,500 or so. And
we got around 2,500 applications approved by the SBA back to us.
So the process is working really well. It's an automated process. We've seen good application volume. The â€“ this
number that I was looking at that I told you about, was, let's see, the 27 which in PPP it used to be an eon. But
let's say, it's pretty good. And that was close to $1 billion worth of volume. So we've seen bit lower average loan
7


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
size than we did in the first round. I think our first round had a number that was, I will say, 180,000-ish number.
This time, so far, it's been about 144,000 average size. I will say that we've seen a volume slow more recently. It
looks like the people that needed this money were lined up to really get in line. And we've seen that 90% of the
numbers that are coming in are from first time PPP borrower â€“ or excuse me, second time PPP borrowers. So
we've seen good activity there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's good color. And then, finally for me, it's uncommon to hear about Cullen/Frost going to lay off. I
think the last time you all did that might have been a couple of decades ago. I know those times are tough
especially with this yield curve. Those layoffs, I think they're about 1.5% of your staff. Is that a one-and-done deal
or will you continue to look not just at the workforce but elsewhere as far as expense reductions this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Brady, you're right. It was a tough thing to do. And it was â€“ one of the first thing we started really was the
last thing. And as Jerry has kind of been reporting, he's modestly been trimming that 10% number he got
[indiscernible] (00:23:19) first of the year down to I think it was under 1% or so down, 1% to 2%, right, for the year.
So there were so many different things that we did.
We got a fair amount of visibility when we â€“ as an executive team, we cut our salaries 10%. And in our last
quarter call, I told you about how our board was â€“ they immediately, in their private session, decided to cut their
compensation 10%, just a vary Frost thing do. It's â€“ so we started with those kind of things and everything that's
discretionary. When we got down to the end of it, we did need to reduce some of these positions because it was
the right thing to do.
We didn't take out a hatchet and made the reductions. They were very thoughtful. I think one thing though that we
decided to do is, reduce the amount of open positions. I mean, we'd much rather reduce a position for someone
we don't know and haven't hired yet than doing that for someone we have hired. And so, there were many more
positions that were open that were reduced than there were reduced recurrent staff.
So no, it's not something that we're planning on doing. And it's not in our outlook right now. It's also true, though,
all banks have been reducing expenses on staffing related to business activity for years, right. I mean, I can go
back and look at, I think it was pre-financial crisis, I was looking at our average assets per employee, it was
something around $3 million each. And then, I think, if you just go back to a couple of years ago, it was literally
double that level.
So we've been using technology more effectively and efficiently. I think we're using it smarter and we're giving
better customer experiences with it. And so, that will have an impact on our growth and people which we wanted
to and expect that to be the case. But no, we're not anticipating anything similar to what we did in January.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Brady, this is Jerry. The one thing I will say, though, is that we're not shifting our focus away from expense
management. So I think Phil is right that the layoffs were tough to do and were the last thing to do. But we
continue to work with the executive team and really the whole organization, looking to them to continue to
participate in trying to save expenses where we can, to be smarter about the things we do and try to find more

efficiency. So, hopefully, in this environment, that's something that our staff will continue to hear us talking about
and hopefully continue to focus on.

your line is now open.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

Good afternoon.

Hey, Ebrahim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. First, if I could just follow up, Jerry, on PPP, a couple of just question around the model. Could you remind
us what the balance was of PPP loans at the end of the year and how much of fees are left to be accrued tied to
PPP 1?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. There's about $39 million left to be earned, and we expect all of that to be earned in 2021. And at the end of
the year, our PPP balance was $2.4 billion, down from $3.2 billion at the end of September.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And do you expect the vast majority of that to come through in the first quarter? I think you expected that last
earnings call.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, I think that what we've seen â€“ we had $800 million roughly, I'm going to say. I don't have the number right in
front of me, but I think it's right between â€“ that paid off or that was forgiven, if you will, between September and
December. It really seems to have slowed down towards the last part of December and into January. I would
expect right now, based on the best information we have is that will bleed in to the second quarter as well. So a
little bit slower than we expected here in January.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And again, just another question around is, I appreciate what you're trying to do in terms of making the
franchise more efficient. I guess nothing wrong with that. But just talk to us in terms of growth outlook means. And
one of your competitors had a call yesterday and talked about all the great things happening in Texas.
[indiscernible] (00:28:10) headquarters being moved, folks moving from the Coasts to Texas. Given that Frost is
probably the largest sort of Texas bank, what does this mean for earnings growth, loan growth for the bank? Like,
talk to us that there and in terms of what are you doing in terms of actually hiring and putting more investments on
the technology frontline personnel?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Ebrahim, well, with regard to Texas, and Texas growth, I mean, I would agree to them. The people have
been moving here for a long time. We've seen a step-up in growth. It's amazing to see the relocations coming
from other markets. Some of the brokers that we have business relationships, and these are very successful
brokers. I remember one telling me. It's awesome that, it used to be 80% of the relocations that they saw from out
of state were from California. Now, it's about half California and half Mid and East â€“ Midwest, East Coast.
And so, it's â€“ I think it's gaining momentum. I think, we're trying to understand the long-term impact of it
particularly in Austin. I mean, it's â€“ there's been a consistency to this kind of thing. But the rate of growth and
momentum in the Austin market has really been remarkable over the last several months. And we're trying to
understand the longer-term impact for that in that market, and then what it means to us in terms of capital
allocation and how we approach that market. So, I think that's literally developing as we all read the headlines and
experience the growth. As far as our expectations on loan growth, I mean, things still are really driven by the
pandemic and impacts we're seeing there.
I mean, we â€“ you saw â€“ you heard me talk about new relationship growth. I mean, I think it's remarkable to have
that kind of relationship growth in a pandemic situation where you really can't get out and visit customers the
same way you used to be able to do it. And so, that's really positive.
At the same time, our pipeline is down and it's â€“ and I really believe that's related to the pandemic. And we're just
going to have to see the general level of business confidence increase and get healthy before we see that go up. I
think we tried to achieve high-single-digit loan growth through the year. I don't expect us to do that â€“ without the
PPP loans, I don't expect us to do that. I expect us to be below that, and then we'll work hard to beat it. But it's a
tough environment.
But nothing's changed in terms of the fundamental outlook for the â€“ for Texas and for our company. I mean, we're
being successful. I think we're taking market share and we're the investments we're making that I know were hard
for our shareholders to â€“ when we were spending current operating earnings for Houston, I really see them
paying off as we continue to move forward. And we're going to continue to do that kind of thing. So I'm really â€“ I'm
optimistic about the future. But this year it's going to continue to be under pressure from COVID.

Phil, you mentioned â€“ I forgot the numbers, right, something like 40% of your new account openings were through
the digital channels. Where were those customers located? Because I'm trying to understand if those customers
are â€“ if they live in the same towns as your existing branches or are they coming from outside of your existing
footprint. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Ken, we found a number that I thought was interesting. It looks like Houston, for example, 60% of the accounts
that were opened online were within a five-minute drive of an existing Frost location. So I think there are a number
of factors at work. I believe people more and more â€“ it's been our experience, more and more doing their research
online which is a positive for us because you'll see really â€“ if you take the time to research, you'll to see very
positive reviews and reactions to us.
And then, they are â€“ I think the fact that say Houston reported how it's an outsized percentage of our growth, not
the only growth we're having, but it is â€“ it's an outsized percentage. People are seeing new locations where they
live and they're opening up. And just we just had a lot of success online. So I would say that they tend to be â€“
they've tended to be in-market, in the markets that we're in, and they tend to be proximate to locations we have.
But as I just said, 60% were within a five-minute drive of our locations in Houston, and so that means 40% work.
So, there is some...

Yeah, that is an interesting statistic. I guess, more â€“ taking it a little bit more broadly, does that imply â€“ because I
know a lot of the banks are obviously focusing very heavily on digital. But does that imply that to continue to grow
your new customer base, banks also would have to continue to open new branches to expand their potential
customers who would apply online?

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I hate to make that broad statement, but I can tell you that, just looking directly at our expansion in Houston, right,
where it was almost a doubling of our locations, and you're seeing the account growth that I've talked about in the
commercial side and the consumer side, I mean, it's certainly helpful and it's additive to the process.
I mean, it's â€“ one thing I always like to point out about our strategy, though, in Houston because it's fun to talk
mainly about consumer because I think we all relate to that as individuals, the biggest revenue piece of that
strategy has to do with small- and mid-sized businesses. If you look at our company overall, what is it, 90%-or-so
of our loan book in round numbers comes from the commercial side, commercial real estate, commercial C&I
lending. And our deposit base is 55%, really, the last time I looked at it, it was about 55% commercial.
So what we're doing is really trying to replicate our business model in these markets. And that means, it's a very
strong small- to mid-sized commercial banking market. So one of the things that I've mentioned before is back
when I could do customer calls, and face-to-faces back in 2019, a number of times, I was with people that were
doing live or FTEs for new banks. And 75 â€“ our nearest locations. So I'd like to keep that in mind. There's very
much a commercial focus there as well. And we've seen really good growth in our commercial relationships in
Houston.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Can you just talk about what's driving your expense growth for this year in terms of your guidance? And you
talked about the [indiscernible] (00:36:53) growth that Austin is seeing. Will you be putting more branches at
market?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Regarding the expenses, Jennifer, a couple of things I'll mention that, as I mentioned in my comments, obviously,
there was some benefit, if you will, in 2020 expenses related to the fact that a lot of incentives weren't paid, right.
We weren't meeting the targets that we needed to meet. And so, our projections for 2021 do represent that we'll
have some increases there.
We also have the impact of the Houston expansion. We talked about that. We have planned on that they would all
be open by the end of 2020. They â€“ that process has been a little bit slower than we expected. And so, we still
actually have three more branches to open. And we opened quite a few in the latter part of 2020. So they're
having a full year impact on 2021. I'm going to say those are primarily the big things that were affecting the growth
between 2020 and 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
And, Jennifer, with regard to Austin, yeah, I think when I talk about we're evaluating the â€“ what the really dramatic
growth Austin is seeing, at least in the headlines but more than that, I was looking at the numbers with the Fed job
growth. It's pretty remarkable what they've been able to do recently. When we say we're looking to understand the
impact of that, yeah, it could result in us â€“ I think it will result in us at some point of adding to locations there and
maybe above what we otherwise would have done. Well, I think there's some work that needs to be done
understanding it because it's changing pretty rapidly. But it's an opportunity, I believe.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Hey. On the margin, you guys hit your guide for the level just above 3% for 2020. How are you guys thinking
about that trend from the 2.82% 4Q or the NII going forward whatever view here ex-PPP given you're maybe
muted for loan growth at least at this point in the year? And then what do you see for new loans and
[indiscernible] (00:39:23) right now, and what are your thoughts on the timing of that $1 billion on securities
purchases you were talking about?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Let me see if I've got all the pieces here. On the NIM, I think you were asking about ex-PPP. As I mentioned in my
comments, right now, we're really not projecting a lot of investment purchases. We've only â€“ I think our modeling
$1 billion. We've got north of $7 billion, $8 billion, even $9 billion some days at the Fed. And so, obviously, that
net interest margin percentage is going to be reacting to that.
But there's definitely pressure obviously on the net interest margin. Right now, the guidance I would give is, if I
look at that fourth quarter NIM, I would expect that we'll probably see high-single-digit movement downward there
just given some of the roll-off of the loans that are that are maturing and being replaced by lower-yielding loans
and kind of the same thing on the investment portfolio.
And then, again, the net interest margin is â€“ we're just having such a big impact from the level of deposits that
we've got. I was looking at it. We've got I think [indiscernible] (00:40:39) right now in today's market don't like what
we see. And so, we'd like the optionality that we have by sitting a little bit on the sidelines there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Yeah, that makes sense. What is the differential now on the front book/back book on the loan book at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I guess â€“ sure. Yeah. I guess, I'll just say, if I'm looking at probably the most pressure we're seeing I'm going to
say is in the C&I book. I was looking and it's probably about 40 basis points, if I look at the new book just being
the stuff that we put in â€“ put on in the in the fourth quarter versus everything before that. And I would...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
I would think you would still have to see some deposit growth this year. You will, I would imagine, still expect to
see NII growth from the 4Q level. You might see more NIM [indiscernible] (00:41:28) is that fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, I think that thing with as far as NII growth is concerned is, really don't forget that we do have PPP in there.
And we really â€“ I guess, I should say that the guidance that we gave really doesn't include PPP. That was almost
intentional on our part. We still need to see kind of what sort of volumes we get in there and we've had
conversations internally.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Obviously, there could be some impact on our projections for the loan growth by this PPP round 2.0, if you will. So
in the â€“ and in 2020, we've recognized about $20 million a quarter in PPP fee income in each of those last three
quarters of the year and we've got about I think I said right under $39 million to $40 million left to earn that I
expect we'll earn by the first couple of quarters of next year. So we'll feel some pressure of that ex this new PPP
fee. But if you layer those back on, yeah, we still haven't really brought that all into our model and looked at what
we think will happen to our models loan growth.

Operator: Your last question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I want to start, so when you indicated that consensus of $4.72 for 2021 is a little low, I'd imagine consensus
includes an assumption for a reserve releases. Do you assume reserve releases in your comment that EPS for
2021 is low?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No. We do not. We're not â€“ that's not part of what we're assuming at this point in any guidance that we give.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then on expenses, I'm honestly a bit confused over the message on expenses. Last
quarter, you talked about the need to get more efficient given the revenue headwinds or that you were cutting
senior management base salaries. But now, you're guiding to 4% to 4.5% in 2021, which I've always considered a
fairly normal year. Is the intense focus on expenses continuing in 2021 or is that a really 4Q event?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No. I mean, the thing that was asked earlier is, we are being impacted, again, we're projecting a more normalized
year as far as revenues and income growth. And so, there were some incentives. Obviously., they didn't get paid
out in 2020 that we're projecting to increase, so basically to get back on, if you will, in 2021.
As I also mentioned, Houston expansion is really more expensive to us in 2021 than it was in 2020. It probably is
a little north of a 1% impact on our expense growth guidance. But no, the focus on expenses continues. That's
what I was saying in my comments. We'll continue to do that. But we're not going to cut technology costs, for
example. That's just not going to happen in this environment. And so, what we'll continue to focus on is ensuring
that, from a people standpoint that we're doing what we need to do and that we really question all the open
positions or all the requests for new positions within the organization. But I think, for us, opening those Houston
branches and having them come all online as we think into 2021 is going to have an obvious impact on our
growth and expenses versus what we had in 2020.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then, final question. You guys have always been the standout bank in your markets
from a client satisfaction view. But as we listen to all of your local competitors, they're all investing in technology,
seemed to be more focused on client experience. Are you seeing tougher competition in the markets more
general?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Are you talking â€“ can you be a little bit more specific? Are you talking about commercial deals? Are you talking
about...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah, all of the above. I mean, when you talk to â€“ it's just about every bank, right, they're investing in technology,
they're investing in digital, they're focused on friction points, right, client experience. And you guys have had the
highest client satisfaction score in your market. And I'm wondering if you are â€“ in the past, you were talking about
losing deals primarily over price and structure. But are you starting to lose more deals because other banks are
just doing a much better job? And that's commercial and consumer, both.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:46:08). No. I would not say that at all. I mean, we've â€“ it's kind of a broad question. But, I mean
if you look at the â€“ it really has to do with â€“ it starts with culture and it's a combination of technology and people. I
mean, our technology is elegant and it's branded. It's very user-friendly. It's smart. And we were â€“ I was looking at
some numbers on account opening online from a peer that I can't talk about because it's risk â€“ got a
confidentiality agreement. But we're one of the top banks of a large group of banks in terms of the account
openings online.
So, we're starting from a good place. And so, I feel like the changes that we're able to implement and have been
implementing in technology still are able to â€“ we're still able to move beyond the competition. They can spend
money and we are, too. And we're all competing. But I'll just give an example. We put a dark mode on our iPhone

app and [indiscernible] (00:47:30) dark mode that time and [indiscernible] (00:47:34) dark mode, I can go down
the list. I mean, so, they are chasing a moving target is what I would say about that.
And then on second thing I would say is, as far as commercial competition and everything, absolutely, it's bad and
it's getting worse. I saw â€“ I think I already said it in my comments. We went up from 67% lost deals. From
structure, it was 61%. I think people are hurting for volumes. They're stretching for deals they want to do. And so,
yeah, it's worse. We're losing more to that kind of thing. But I'll tell you, I'm prepared to lose deals for bad
structure. There is no greener pasture across the fence of good credit quality. There's nothing there but a
wasteland. And I don't intend to go over there.
So, yeah, it's complicated. I mean, it's complicated but it's also competitive. And we're ready to compete. And I'll
take my team and compete with anybody in this market.

Operator: We have a question from Michael Rose with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Are you guys doing anything on any of your fee businesses, making any sort of
targeted investments? Maybe you can give us an update on the trust business and the insurance business. And
then just quickly, was there anything that drove the increase sequentially in other fee income? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, first of all, broadly, I mean, in our fee-based businesses, yeah, we've been investing in those too. The one
that comes to mind is, we had a major system upgrade and conversion in our trust business which I can't tell how
long we've been working on that, but it was â€“ it's been a positive to us and went just flawlessly. So proud of the
team and how they were able to do it, and they did it from home during COVID.
If you look at the -- our treasury management systems, we've upgraded both of those. We got really great scores
from Greenwich Associates for treasury management and â€“ for years, still do. But for years, we did it with a
system that we were using a partner that we felt we could do better, and we knew we could do better, and there
were features that we were frustrated when we weren't able to bring to the table. And we really got those high
marks because of the quality of service our people give.
Now, we have systems which we have put in place to upgrade which has increased mobile capability, et cetera,
for both the larger, more sophisticated customers, and then also, for the smaller customers as well. So we're
attacking the market there with a much better product offering on the technology side there.
17


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
And one thing I'll say about the major customers and the implementation that new system, we did not lose any
customers to attrition as a result of that system conversion. I've never heard of that as it relates to treasury
management system conversion. Usually, what
Happens is, if that happens, you really go after those companies who happened to go through that because if
they're going through a conversion, they might as well convert your system. But for us to not have really any
attrition for that system just speaks to the quality of the service that our people have been providing and also, I
think, the quality of the system. So, yeah, we've been putting some money there.
And, Jerry, I think he had some questions with...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Regarding the linked-quarter other income, yeah, most of that is related to some debit card incentives that
we recognized in the fourth quarter. So from â€“ compared to the fourth quarter a year ago, you don't see that sort
of variability. But in the linked third to fourth quarter, you'll see that there. And then we also had a good month and
our trading activity was higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the third. And our public finance underwriting
group had a strong quarter. So those things impacted the variability on the linked-quarter basis.
