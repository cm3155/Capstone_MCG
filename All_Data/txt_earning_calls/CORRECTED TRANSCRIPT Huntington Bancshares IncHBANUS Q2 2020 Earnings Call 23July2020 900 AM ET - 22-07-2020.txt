Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. We're pleased with our second quarter results
which reflect solid execution across the bank despite an incredibly dynamic and challenging operating
environment. Revenue was essentially in level with the year-ago quarter as record mortgage income offset
pandemic-related headwinds. The actions we've taken to reduce our deposit costs along with the hedging
strategy we implemented in 2019 are helping to offset the impact from lower rates. Expenses were down year-
over-year as a result of the proactive expense actions we took in the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as the new
program we are implementing in 2020.
Our business model, balance between commercial and consumer, provides diversification of revenue, of course,
this performance is offsetting challenges. Our increased PPNR year-over-year reflects consistent execution of our
strategies. Our purpose of looking out for people has guided our actions during these different times. I'm
extremely proud of my colleagues and their continued efforts to mitigate with and support our customers as well
as each other. Over the past month, the bank funded more than 37,000 loans with a total volume of more than $6
billion through the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, to aid small‐ and medium‐sized businesses
across our footprint. Huntington is well positioned with robust capital and liquidity to remain supportive of our
customers and communities going forward.
Huntington received the highest score in the J.D. Power 2020 Mobile App Satisfaction Study for regional banks
and this is the second year in a row we've been recognized by J.D. Power, providing evidence that our focused
technology investments are being well received by our customers. As we assess the outlook for the economy, we
are guardedly optimistic for a gradual economic recovery. The unprecedented level of government stimulus has
supported both individuals and many companies. That support has brought financial stability in the markets.
Recent economic headlines generally appear more positive with homebuilder, auto, RV and marine sales and
sentiment exceeding pre-pandemic levels. US consumer retail sales rose 7.5% in June as businesses have
resumed operations.
In our businesses, we saw a record consumer mortgage origination activity in the second quarter. Our commercial
pipelines have improved over the past few weeks and our customers are becoming more optimistic for the future
with many manufacturing customers expecting to be back to pre-pandemic activity levels during the second half of
the year. Our outlook reflects consensus view of economists that the recovery is taking hold, but progress will be
uneven. While we do see signs for optimism, we remain vigilant to possible risks and our visibility is generally
limited to the next few months. The range of potential outcomes on key metrics remains wide. We are monitoring
economic and consumer data closely and tightly managing our businesses.
As a result of lower interest rate levels, we are taking actions to manage expenses this year, which Zach will
further describe. We'll remain disciplined on expense growth while making further investments in technology and
other strategic business initiatives as the economy recovers. And as we've discussed previously over the past
decade, we have fundamentally changed Huntington's enterprise risk management. It's now a strength of the
company as compared to a weakness during the prior cycle. The most recent DFAST results demonstrate
superior credit performance for our fifth consecutive DFAST filing.
Our modeled cumulative loan losses in the Fed's severely adverse scenario remain among the best in the peer
group, while our stress capital buffer established at the minimum level of 2.5%. Our commitment to an aggregate
moderate-to-low risk profile is illustrated through the DFAST results. Our second quarter credit metrics remain
sound as we address the issues in our oil and gas portfolio. With our second quarter provision, we believe we

have the loss exposure in the oil and gas portfolio fully reserved. Our underlying portfolio metrics continue to
reflect our expectation for outperformance through the cycle.
We've restrained our commercial lending in 2019 with the fourth quarter average year-over-year growth rate of
1.8%, which gives us a more seasoned portfolio of commercial loans at this point in the cycle. This morning we
announced that the board declared the third quarter cash dividend of $0.15 per common share unchanged from
the prior quarter. Based on what we know today, management expects to maintain the quarterly dividend rate in
the fourth quarter, subject to the board's normal quarterly approval process, and you'll hear more about the
dividend from Zach as well.
So, Zach, I'll ask you now to provide an overview of the financial performance and carry forward.

Zachary J. Wasserman
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 3 provides the highlights of the 2020 second quarter. We
reported earnings per common share of $0.13, return on average assets was 51 basis points, return on average
common equity was 5%, and return on average tangible common equity was 6.7%. Clearly, results were
significantly impacted by the elevated level of credit provision expense as we added $218 million to the reserve
during the quarter.
Now, let's turn to slide 4 to review our results in more detail. Year-over-year pre-tax pre-provision earnings growth
was 4%. We believe this is solid performance in light of the challenges of the interest rate environment and the
rapid decline in short-term rates year-to-date. Total revenue was relatively flat versus the year-ago quarter as
pressure on spread revenues was nearly offset by growth in fee income. Specifically, record mortgage banking
income of $96 million was partially offset by waivers to assist our customers' reduced customer activity and the
higher levels of consumer deposit account balances that reduced the deposit service charges and cards and
payment fee line items.
Total expenses were lower by $25 million or 4% from the year-ago quarter. This expense discipline reflects the
actions we took in the 2019 fourth quarter to reduce our overhead expense run rate, including the reduction of
200 positions and the closure of 31 in-store branches; as well as the actions we have taken to adapt to the current
environment, balanced against the impact of continued investment in our technology capabilities.
Finally, I would like to note that the normal slides containing comparisons for our net interest income, fee income,
and noninterest expense can be found in the appendix.
Turning to slide 5, net interest margin was 2.94% for the quarter, down 20 basis points linked quarter in line with
the guidance we provided at the Mortgage Stanley Conference in June. The second quarter NIM was negatively
impacted by a few unusual items that I would like to highlight. Elevated deposits held at the Fed during the quarter
reduced NIM by 7 basis points versus the first quarter. This impact would have been larger but for our active
management to move several billion dollars of non-primary bank relationship account balances off the sheet
during the quarter. Reduced loan late fees primarily in our auto portfolio compressed NIM by 3 basis points.
Additionally, in Q2, NIM was negatively impacted by a 3-basis-point derivative ineffectiveness mark, while in Q1,
the mark was positive 4 basis points, thus 7 basis points of the 20 basis points of quarter-to-quarter NIM
compression was driven by this item. Our underlying NIM performed quite well despite the challenging interest
rate environment. Given our strong liquidity position, we continue to actively manage down our cost of funds. Our
average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 25 basis points in the month of June, and we see some continued

opportunity for modest further reduction. Our hedging actions continue to reduce the unfavorable impacts of
interest rate volatility and the lower interest rate environment. In the second quarter, we had $1.6 billion of forward
starting asset hedges become active providing NIM benefit going forward.
Moving forward to slide 6, average earning assets increased $9.9 billion or 10% compared to the year-ago
quarter. Average commercial and industrial loans increased 15% from the year-ago quarter and 14% linked
quarter, reflecting the addition of $4.1 billion in average PPP loans. As of quarter end, the total PPP loan balance
was just over $6 billion.
Outside of PPP lending, we saw solid growth in healthcare and asset finance in the quarter, offsetting this growth,
auto floorplan line utilization was suppressed due to lack of new inventory from OEMs and we continued to
actively manage the noncore exposure in our oil and gas portfolio down, including $170 million of loans sold or
under contract to be sold in the second quarter. Consumer loan growth remained focused in the residential
mortgage portfolio, reflecting robust originations over the past four quarters. Also, as a result of the elevated
deposit levels in the quarter, we saw a material increase in interest-bearing deposits being held at the Fed.
Turning to slide 7, we will review the deposit growth. Average core deposits increased 13% year-over-year and
12% versus the first quarter, primarily driven by commercial loan growth related to the PPP loans and commercial
line draws, consumer growth related to government stimulus, and reduced account attrition. During the quarter,
we saw dramatic shifts in the retail deposit acquisition trends as consumer and business banking customers
adapted to the COVID environment. We saw utilization of online account opening channels increased 13%
quarter-over-quarter and 61% year-over-year. We are now seeing traditional branch-based acquisition
approaching pre-COVID levels.
Slide 8 highlights the trends in commercial loans, total deposits, salable mortgage originations, and debit card
spend which is consistent with what we disclosed at last month's Morgan Stanley Conference.
Slide 9 illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, or
CET1, ended the quarter at 9.84%, down 4 basis points year-over-year. The tangible common equity ratio, or
TCE, ended the quarter at 7.28%, down 52 basis points from a year ago.
Let me turn it over now to Rich to cover credit. Rich?

Richard A. Pohle
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Zach. Before I get into the second quarter credit results, I want to turn your attention to slide 10, which
illustrates the relative rankings of modeled cumulative loan losses for Huntington and our peers in the Federal
Reserve's severely adverse scenarios of the 2020 DFAST exercise. As Steve has mentioned over time, this is the
only true comparison of credit risk across the sector that we know of and it provides us independent validation of
the credit risk management discipline and practices we've been implementing for over a decade now to achieve
an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. Our 2020 DFAST result puts us at the top of our peer group and we've
been a top-quartile peer performer in each DFAST exercise since 2015. Our portfolio composition evenly split
between consumer and commercial businesses gives us diversification in periods of economic stress and our
DFAST numbers reflect as much.
Turning now to the credit metrics and results. Slide 11 provides a walk of our allowance for credit losses or ACL
from year end 2019 to the second quarter. You can see our ACL has more than doubled during this period,
increasing by just under $1 billion to 2.27% of loans. Excluding the PPP loan balances, our ACL would be 2.45%
5

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
as of June 30. The second quarter allowance represents a $218 million reserve build from the first quarter. Like
the first quarter, there were multiple data points used to size the provision expense for Q2. The primary economic
scenario within our loss estimation process was in May Moody's baseline forecast. This scenario assumes peak
unemployment in Q2 2020 to 15%, followed by a rebound to 9% by the end of 2020, and a slow recovery to 8.5%
by the fourth quarter of 2021.
GDP recovers from a 33% decline in 2Q 2020 to end the full year down almost 6% and demonstrates 1.5%
growth in 2021 with most occurring in the second half of the year. The Q2 ACL now includes a 30% reserve
against our oil and gas portfolio. We believe we have the loss content in this portfolio fully reserved. We have
bifurcated this portfolio into core and noncore segments, with the noncore portion representing just under 60% of
oil and gas borrowings. Our 30% coverage includes a 44% coverage ratio against the noncore portfolio and a 9%
reserve against the core portfolio. Recall that our oil and gas portfolio represents about 1% of total loans.
Slide 12 shows our NPAs and TDRs and demonstrates the impact of our oil and gas portfolio has had on our
overall level of NPAs. We have discussed for several quarters the challenges we see with this portfolio.
Commodity prices continued to range below economical levels for this industry. Oil and gas NPAs represent 40%
of our overall NPAs and are also a significant contributor to our Q2 NPA build. Notably, over 95% of our oil and
gas NPAs were current pay with respect to principal and interest as on quarter end.
Slide 13 provides additional details around the financial accommodations we've provided to our commercial
customers. The commercial deferrals are now graduating to amendments and waivers. And outside of the
hospitality and other travel-related businesses, we do not see a widespread need for additional payment relief.
Our auto dealers and franchise restaurant customers, two of our larger deferral users, are both exiting those
deferral periods in a strong shape and we expect nearly all those deferrals to run their course in Q3. To date,
request for additional deferral periods have been limited in the other commercial portfolios as well.
Slide 14 shows our consumer deferrals and the early news here is good as well. Our auto, RV/marine and
HELOC portfolios are performing as we would have expected with modest post-deferral delinquencies. Our focus
on high FICO customers here has shielded us somewhat from job losses we've seen. The mortgage
accommodations are a two-step process as the new forbearance agreement is necessary upon the expiration of
the first. As a result, we have limited visibility into the resolution here.
Slide 15 provides an update to the industries hardest hit by COVID-19 to date. We have thoroughly reviewed
these portfolios as well as 75% of our total commercial loan portfolios since April and believe we have the existing
risks identified and appropriately managed. Our hotel exposure is centered on five primary sponsors, most of
them are long-term relationships, including through the last downturn. We believe these sponsors have the
liquidity and financial flexibility to see their way through the longer-term recovery period we forecast for this
industry.
Our restaurant exposure is primarily in the national quick-service brands that have maintained drive-up operations
and our sandwich and pizza customers have been open for takeout service to offset the declines in in-house
seating. We believe this book to be in good shape overall, but we'll continue to closely monitor the heightened risk
in the single location and other non-franchise names in the portfolio. As a leading SBA lender in the country, we
also get guarantees on over $400 million of the restaurant, child care, physician's practices and other sectors,
which provides us additional opportunities for recoveries.
In the second quarter, as part of our active portfolio management process, we evaluated the COVID-related
impacts across all portfolios and took appropriate actions as required by regulatory guidance to downgrade those

severely impacted credits to criticized status. This review resulted in an increase to our criticized asset level of
$1.1 billion in the quarter. As you would expect, [indiscernible] (18:18) on the industries referenced in the chart:
hospitality, retail, airport parking and auto suppliers. The customers in these affected industries, except for auto,
[indiscernible] (18:29) to a full recovery and [indiscernible] (18:31) to move those credits to criticized status. We
will take a patient approach to working with these customers and currently do not see significant loss content. Of
the 30% of the downgrades, we did not attribute to COVID, most of that was in our oil and gas portfolio.
Slide 16 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our credit performance on the whole
was strong. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 54 basis points of average loans and leases. The
commercial charge-offs were centered in the oil and gas portfolio which made up approximately 75% of the total
commercial net charge-offs. I would also point out that nearly all these oil and gas charge-offs resulted from loan
sales closed or contracted for sale during the quarter as we prudently reduced our exposure to this industry.
Annualized total net charge-offs excluding the oil and gas related losses were 24 basis points demonstrating that
the balance of our portfolio continued to perform well in Q2. Consumer charge-offs were down to 30 basis points
in Q2, demonstrating our continued strong consumer portfolio. As always, we've provided additional granularity by
portfolio in the analyst package and the slides. The nonperforming asset ratio increased 14 basis points linked
quarter and 28 basis points year-over-year to 89 basis points due to the oil and gas impact I described earlier.
Let me turn it back over to Zach.

Zachary J. Wasserman
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thank you, Rich. Turning to slide 17, I will provide our expectations for the third quarter. As was the case last
quarter, we feel it's prudent to limit our guidance to the current quarter due to the ongoing uncertainty around the
economic outlook. As Steve alluded to earlier, we've confidence in our businesses and are pleased with our
second quarter results given the headwinds in the quarter. Our sentiment has improved from 90 days ago due to
the recent trends we're seeing and the actions we've taken to better position the bank for success going forward.
Looking at the average balance sheet for the third quarter, we expect average loans to be approximately flat on a
linked quarter basis. Consumer loans are expected to increase approximately 2% driven by continued growth in
the residential mortgage and RV and marine lending. Commercial loans are expected to decrease approximately
1% as the full quarter impact of PPP is more than offset by continued reductions in dealer floorplan and
commercial loan utilization rates. Our current projections assume the majority of the PPP balances will remain on
the balance sheet through the end of the year.
Our early stage commercial pipelines have been building over the past several weeks, supporting the expectation
of accelerating growth in the latter part of the year. We balance this customer optimism with an acknowledgement
of the fluidity of the current economy and some concern that the recent upward trend in the inflection could
dampen the pace of the economic recovery. We expect average total deposits to decrease approximately 1%
linked quarter. Commercial deposits are expected to decrease approximately 3% assuming gradual usage of
deposit inflows from the government stimulus.
We expect total revenue to increase approximately 2% linked quarter, with the net interest income increasing 2%
to 4%. We expect GAAP NIM to expand approximately 7 to 10 basis points versus the second quarter NIM of
2.94% as a result of the hedging strategy and the elimination of notable items which negatively impacted the
second quarter, namely 3 basis points of reduced loan rate fees and 3 basis points of derivative ineffectiveness

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
mark. Our NIM expectation does not include material benefit from the acceleration of PPP fees from the
repayment or forgiveness of those loans in the third quarter.
We expect fee income to be approximately flat as mortgage banking activity remains robust and pandemic
impacted revenue lines rebound. Based on the debit card trends, we would expect a slight pickup in card-related
fees in the third quarter. Deposit account activity volumes are increasing, yet given the elevated level of consumer
deposits, we do not expect a full recovery in deposit service charges. These increases are expected to be offset
by reduced other income as the second quarter contained gains of $18 million related to the annuitization of a
retiree health plan and the retirement plan services recordkeeping business sales. As I mentioned earlier, we are
benefiting from the expense actions we took in the fourth quarter of 2019.
In addition, given both the significant economic challenges of 2020 and the desire to self-fund some of the
compelling initiatives being identified in our ongoing strategic planning process, we are now executing the
expense management program we have previewed for you on prior calls. As I mentioned previously, our outlook
to this plan is focused on four categories of expenses: the size and compensation level of the organization;
structural expenses, including our branch and corporate facilities; investments, primarily the optimization of the
level of marketing; and lastly, other discretionary expenses. This program is sized to generate approximately $75
million of annual savings in 2020 and 2021.
In 2020, this cost rationalization will allow the bank to prudently manage expenses given the economic and
business uncertainty that exists this year. We've modeled numerous scenarios for the 2020 financial outlook with
the majority of these forecasts achieving positive operating leverage for 2020, inclusive of the expected
approximately $25 million of restructuring costs related to the expense management program. Importantly, we've
been positioning the company for some time to be ready to capitalize on opportunities to drive accelerated
revenue and market share growth that will arise when the economic recovery begins to solidify.
While our longer-term planning for 2021 is still a work in process, our current expectation is that we continue to
see positive signs of economic stabilization and regrowth, we'll accelerate investments in digital technology
capabilities, product differentiation and other strategic initiatives in the latter part of 2020 and into next year,
potentially utilizing up to the full amount of these savings for this purpose in calendar year 2020. Thus, this
program provides the opportunity to fund these initiatives, while generally maintaining a strong expense efficiency
level in 2020.
Focusing on the expense outlook for the third quarter, we expect noninterest expenses to increase approximately
5% on a linked quarter basis. Approximately 2% of this growth is driven by the $15 million of the total
approximately $25 million restructuring costs associated with the expense management actions that we'd
recognize in the third quarter. The remaining approximately 3% is driven by investments in technology and
marketing as well as the return of customer and sales activity closer to pre-pandemic levels.
Finally, we expect net charge-offs in the third quarter to be near 65 basis points. This is reflective of the potential
charge-offs in the oil and gas portfolio as well as broader economic considerations. Fundamentally, our credit
remains sound; however, the economic outlook remains uncertain, and we're likely to see elevated provision
expense through the remainder of 2020.

Nice job. There's a lot of places to go, but let's just talk oil and gas to get that out of the way. Longer term, what's
the plan there? Is it just to get down to $500 million or $600 million what you call your core portfolio? And if you
could maybe project, is it – are you done in Q3 or are you done in Q4? When does the noise start to go away
from this portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hey, Jon. It's Rich. With respect to the oil and gas piece of it, we've got it bifurcated into a core and noncore
sector, and the focus is really on getting that noncore piece of the portfolio down, and through whatever methods
we have – and you saw in Q2 that we sold $170 million to the extent that we've got opportunities where we think
the sale price is better than what a recovery might be; if the credit got into trouble, we would certainly do that.
As it relates to the ongoing strategy, we're not originating any new loans in that space, we haven't for over a year
now. I think we're really just focused on the portfolio we have now and managing the risk there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Jon, this is probably the last quarter we're going to distinguish ourselves with reporting out the oil and gas like
this, because we believe we've got [indiscernible] (28:19) fully reserved, and while you'll see metrics around that,
we don't feel a need to call it out like we have this quarter, picking up in the normal course. Then, we'll look to
maximize the portfolio, particularly [ph] in our core (28:36) over time.

Okay. All right. And then, just a follow-up, the rest of it looks so clean from a credit perspective, and Zach, you
talked about the third quarter, fourth quarter provisions remaining elevated. I see it, 2.45% ACL and relatively
retained credit metrics. I guess the question is, how much a reserve build do you think you still need and how do
you want us to think through that third quarter and fourth quarter provisioning level?

Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
We haven't really thought about whether a build in the third quarter would look like. As you work through the
seasonal methodology, it is a point in time process. And so, similar to what we did in Q2, we will do the same
process in Q3. We will look at what the change in the economic outlook might be. For the end of September,
we're certainly not going to race into anything earlier in the quarter and we're going to take every available day we
have to look at the economic condition and the forecast that we see. We'll also have another quarter of portfolio
activity to see how the portfolio is behaving relative to our expectations, and based on those two factors, we'll look
at where we think the provision [indiscernible] (29:57). So, it's really hard for us to sit here and really
[indiscernible] (30:01) forecast additional builds, it's really a quarter by quarter kind of step by step process.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
But Jon, we do like generally how the portfolio has performed thus far and feel good having looked at a very
substantial amount of the commercial portfolio in depth during the quarter and tried to have a realistic, if not
conservative lens look, which is reflected in some of the metrics like the criticized loan increase. But the
performance for the quarter was frankly better than we would have expected it to be at the core and we're – but
we've got a recurrence of the virus, it looks like coming and we don't know what the fourth round, if it happens
[indiscernible] (30:58) there's a lot of unknowns here. So, it's very, very difficult to project where this is
[indiscernible] (31:02).

Analyst, Evercore ISI
On your comment right there you just mentioned to Jon about looking at the reserves each quarter and you just
mentioned you'll look at the behavior of your credits versus your expectations. Isn't that a dynamic that under
CECL should have already been factored into the reserve in terms of how the credits are actually behaving versus
what your model, because now you're providing a lifetime loss expectation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
No. That's right. And I thought – my comment was meant to mean that we will look at how the portfolio – if there
are changes in the portfolio from the end of Q2 to the end of Q3.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. So, what about the growth then versus the underlying credit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, it could be growth, it could also be changes in underlying credit, I mean to the extent that there is further
deterioration or improvement, either way in the portfolio that gets reflected in the modeled outputs for what would
go into Q3.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay, got it. And then, I guess – so, if the 2.45% reserve right now, excluding PPP loans, does represent your
best expectation of the lifetime loss content of your loan portfolio, how do you attribute the difference between that
ratio and your company run most recent DFAST estimate that you did, does it all comes down to the macro
assumptions and the amount of stimulus that you're factoring in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. We haven't disclosed the company run DFAST scenarios, but certainly there is going to be a number of
factors that will go into what we've provided in our forecast versus what we're just running through the models.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. I got it. And then lastly, just want to ask about the cadence of the cost saves, sort of the $75 million, could
you talk about how – I know you mentioned a portion in 2020 and then the rest in 2021, could you just talk about
how we can expect the timing of that to play out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. This is Zach, John. Thanks for the question. So, as I mentioned, it's about a $75 million save in both years,
and over time, the – like we've said many times in the past, we want to manage the expense base based on the
revenue outlook. And so, a very substantial chunk of that $75 million we'd expect to flow to the bottom line in 2020
and not be reinvested, to the extent that we see the economy improving as we go forward, and the pace and the
level of that recovery, because we're certain would expect to start to rev up the investments as I mentioned in my
prepared remarks, and therefore have a less or potentially even neutral net benefit from that in 2021 as we go
forward. But for 2020, just to kind of come back to your question specifically, around a third of that save accrued
to the second quarter, and so it's around $50 million left on a gross basis before any modest acceleration
investments in the back half of the year and before the $25 million restructuring costs in Q3 and Q4.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could help us walk through the impact of PPP in terms of
the yield you're seeing on that portfolio, what it added to NII. And Zach, I know you said that forgiveness is not
built into the forecast, but how are you generally anticipating it to go going forward? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for the question. Let me try to put some math behind this for you. So, just starting first with the
yield, it was accretive to yield in the second quarter by, as we noted, about 2 basis points of net interest margin.
Really what drives that is the portfolio rate we were seeing in June was 3.43% on an accrual basis for those loans
in June, which was made up of 1% of the underlying yield and then the amortization [ph] award for us (35:41)
based on the size, mix of our loan of PPP – our PPP loans was around 3% placement fee over the life of the loan.
So, the combination of those two things for June was 3.43%, and hence, additive to the overall NIM by around 2
basis points. It was around $35 million of revenue in Q2 as well. As we go forward into Q3, from a NIM
perspective, I think it's accretive by around 1 basis point is our current estimate, so it's a tiny drag on a quarter-to-
quarter basis of 1 basis point down, but pretty neutral in that respect into the third quarter.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
In terms of the forgiveness, I think is the other part of your question, this continues to be a function of estimates,
as you might imagine, but our planning estimate at this point is that a roughly 85% of the loans outstanding will be
forgiven. The process around that is the thing that's driving the most uncertainty around the timing. And so, right
now, we're assuming that the loans less than $150,000 each, which is around $1 billion of the $6 billion loans, will
be on a – likely on a fast track forgiveness process, and hence, will likely be forgiven in the fourth quarter. So,
that's our planning assumption for that. And then, let's say around 10% of the remaining greater than $150,000
loans are forgiven in Q4, which would make about one-quarter of the total $6 billion forgiven in Q4 with the
remainder of 75% forgiven – of what's going to be forgiven in Q1. So, I think by the end of the year, we expect –
on an average basis in Q4, we still expect to see around $4.7 billion of PPP in the fourth quarter coming down to
around $700 million by Q1 of next year. Does that [indiscernible] (37:36)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Yeah. And just a follow-up, the $35 million you recognized in 2Q, when you get a full quarter of it in 3Q,
what are you ballparking that to turn into? I know you put it in NIM terms directionally, but in terms of dollar terms?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.

This is Janet Lee on for Steve. I've a follow-up question on energy. So, your energy levels are at 30% of total
exposure and this being fully reserved for the loss content. Can you just share with us some of the key underlying
assumptions baked into these reserve levels, such as a trajectory of energy charge-off, NPLs and credit size
going from here as well as some of the macro factors, like where you think the oil price [indiscernible] (38:45)?
Thanks.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Yeah. It's Rich, Janet. We took a number of factors as we kind of sized the reserve build there. When we looked
at the core and noncore portfolios, there are a number of factors that went into that designation, whether it's
liquidity and – but a big piece of that is borrowing base coverage, and that lasts as long as the hedges lasts. And
so, our challenge with the book in general is just our view in where commodity prices are going to go, and as the
hedges roll off, there's just more exposure to what we think is a pretty uneconomical level of price to support
drilling and more important to support capital.
So, the seasonality of the oil and gas business will drive some of the charge-off decisions. As you would expect,
the spring and fall borrowing base redetermination are a big driver of kind of a fresh look at whether the loans are
relative to the collateral and that's part of what we saw in the second quarter was the spring redetermination
results kind of flowing through and [indiscernible] (39:57) proactive in terms of getting out of credits, [ph] there
were four (40:01) structural over-advances in deals in our book, in the second quarter, we sold two of them and
moved the other two to NPA. So, I think as it relates to further NPA growth that will be really based more around
borrowing base redetermination periods. The charge-offs will be a function largely of, if there are sale
opportunities and also around borrowing base redetermination.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
All right. That's helpful. And I think last quarter you disclosed $3 billion exposure in leveraged lending comprised
of a number of different industries. Some of your peers experienced some charge-offs in the leveraged lending
portfolio. I just want to see like how this portfolio is performing, anything abnormal you're seeing on the credit
side? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. As it relates to the leveraged lending, the portfolio did go up modestly in the second quarter, went up by
about 5% to 6%, really due to fallen angel activity, more than anything it relates to new originations. As you might
recall, we've got a fairly modest leverage threshold for leveraged loans, it's 2.5 times senior as opposed to most
people did 3 times. So, to the extent that these credits, with the first quarter results kind of fell into that criteria we
designated them fallen angels and removed them from the leveraged lending bucket. We did not have any
leveraged lending originated charge-offs in Q2. We are keeping an eye on them from [indiscernible] (41:43)
standpoint, there were some downgrades within that book as you might expect, but nothing significant.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hey, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. I just was wondering if you could discuss the health of the auto dealer portfolio. I know it's an area of focus last
quarter. You mentioned earlier on the call that inventory levels are lower and there was some incremental reserve
build here in the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. The auto floorplan business is actually bouncing back in very good shape. We had about $0.5 billion of
deferrals, deferred P&I in that book and that is all going to roll off in the third quarter. There's very – the demand,
notwithstanding the fact that the new car inventories are down, June results were very strong across our dealer
book. And so, we expect that book, barring any further shutdowns or things like that, to bounce back pretty
quickly. The challenge for that sector is just getting inventory and they don't think that they will be back
[indiscernible] (43:08) inventory levels on their [ph] last (43:10) before the end of the year. So, there was not much
in the way at all of reserve build as it relates to the floorplan volume.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And the indirect loans [indiscernible] (43:21)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. The indirect is performing very well. You can see the deferral piece of that was fairly modest to start with,
about 8% – I'm sorry, about 3% of the book. And coming out of the deferral, the payment rates are very strong
[indiscernible] (43:40) 92%, paying has increased coming out of the deferral. So, we are watching that like we're
watching all the consumer portfolios, just given the impact of the deferrals on the overall book. But that is a high
FICO book; we have a custom score card and that book has performed very well through the DFAST exercises
and we expect it to continue to perform well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thank you. And then, just as a follow-up, thanks for – page 8, the bottom right, the volume. Thanks for updating
that exhibit. Just the decline in the last couple weeks or maybe the last month in volume and transactions, is that
just a short-term blip, or are you seeing just the increase in number of COVID cases beginning to impact volume
overall?

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Correct. Correct. Bottom right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. This is Zach. So, we've seen – it's like a roughly 2% year-over-year reduction in the last week versus the
prior 10 days. So, I think in the first 10 days of July, [ph] deferred (44:46) volumes were up about 20% year-on-
year. In the last week, they were up 18.7%, so not even 2%, I guess as I talked to you about the numbers. And I
think as we look across industries, we are seeing a little bit of a blip down. I was studying the numbers this
morning and one of the industries where we're seeing a most substantial blip, sort of not surprisingly, is in
restaurants and bars. So, likely that is to some degree impacted by what we're seeing in terms of some of the
economic reopening guidance changing and things of that nature, but we're still seeing pretty robust snapping
back in year-over-year growth overall.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Most of the high points have been covered. I was wondering if you could just talk about the mortgage and
what your expectations are for the remainder of the year. It seems a bit like COVID has kind of pushed out the
spring selling season. Obviously, we've got a massive change in rates. Can you sustain your performance here
longer than you would in a normal year I guess?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Brock, what we're seeing in the market here is that, it's a lack of inventory. We've had very good, very strong
sales. So, the construction is not keeping phase with demand and you're seeing that flow through in terms of
number of levels of inventory in a number of markets, I should say. So, we've had a very strong performance on
the housing front and we think that will continue as a consequence of the virus, and it's somewhat labor
constrained on the build or supply side.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Yeah. And the primary, secondary mortgage spreads have been kind of juiced up with all the damage in the fixed
income markets. Do you see that rapidly coming in here in the third quarter or is that more sustainable, which
would support mortgage banking [ph] reps (47:15)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. This is Zach. I'll just tack on to some of Steve's comments and try to address that – answer the question.
Generally, I think the outlook for Q3 is pretty similar to Q2 in terms of volumes and a modest tightening of spread.
It was sort of around 15 basis points – 10 to 15 basis points lower spread as that trend continues we've been
seeing for a while. I think the outlook for Q4 is harder to ascertain at this point just based on the timing of pipeline
and things of that nature, and clearly the pipeline for Q2 – or for Q3 looks pretty similar to what it did for Q2. With
that being said, our planning assumption is that the spreads will continue to come down in Q4 and that volumes
are typically seasonally a fair amount lower in Q4 and we'll also see that downdraft as well. So, I think the trends
you noted are in fact happening, the velocity with which they happen is still a question mark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. And on the deposit fees, due to some of those waivers, fees were kind of lighter. How quickly can
that come back?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. We're assuming that some of them come back in the third quarter. I think really it's going to be a function of
how quickly the deposits on the sheets start to get used. I think this is a phenomenon that we've noted across the
entire industry that the deposit gathering activity in the second quarter was just extremely robust. And what we've
seen in our own portfolio was around 70% we estimate on the consumer side, the government stimulus and some
of the unemployment benefits are being saved in accounts, and that's only ticking down single-digit percentage
points per month as we go forward. So, it's hard to say, because that's going to be the key driver is what happens
with overall deposits, and therefore, some overdraft activity. With that being said, we're expecting a modest
increase as we move into the third quarter and then, as sort of indicated in our comments, Q4 is harder to
ascertain at this point.
