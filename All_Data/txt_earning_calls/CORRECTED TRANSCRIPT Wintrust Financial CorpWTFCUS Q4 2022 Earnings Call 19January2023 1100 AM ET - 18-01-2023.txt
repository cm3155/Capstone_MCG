Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Earnings per share $2.23 for the quarter, $8.02 for the year compared to $7.58 for the previous year. And the pre-
tax pre-provision income, it was a record for us, I think, $243 million, versus the $206 million for the year or $780
million versus $579 million. And the [indiscernible] (00:03:16) continue its way up. And the margin finished at
3.73%, 3.17% for the year, up from 3.35% in the third quarter, up 38 basis points and 59 basis points year-to-date
at 3.17%. And then we expect to approach 4% coming this next quarter, Tim will talk about all that. Return on
assets around 1% of the year, 1.10% for the quarter. Return on equity of 12.72%, 7.41% for the year. Tangible
book value rose to $61 a share, compared to $59.64 fourth quarter 2021. Again, it was a very good year for us.
If you look at the balance sheet to some extent, assets grew nicely for the year, the loans were up about $1
billion, versus about almost $700 million over average. So we'll be able to post that going forward. The margin, as
Tim will discuss – Tim and Dave will discuss, I mean, to hedge a little bit to maintain our downside risk. It makes
sense as rates go up. Their next move will be down at some point and they're adjusting the balance sheet there.
Tim will talk about that.
Credit cycle is so remarkably good – Murphy will talk about that but we'll point out that if you look at the real
numbers, the quarter was actually down for the quarter because of about $17 million of fiscal life loans that got
hung up and waiting for the money to come back. If we look at the fiscal portfolio, you have to understand that all
that money that's out there that we show is past due, has been confirmed is going to be returned. So our credit
was actually better than it was before and feel very good about that.
I'll now turn over to Tim...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Looks good. Thanks, Ed. I'd like to highlight a few balance sheet items and I'll also comment on several items
likely to be of interest, including the continued impact of rising rates and the margin expectations. The
approximately $1 billion of growth for the fourth quarter, was11% loan growth on an annualized basis, which
continues to be spread nicely across all major loan categories. As noted in the release, period-end loan balances
were $630 million higher than the quarter average, which will help our first quarter 2023 results.
Going forward, while we remain encouraged by stable loan pipelines, we believe there is some evidence of a
modest slowdown in market loan demand. Loan growth in the mid- to high-single digits on an annualized basis
remains a reasonable expectation given the current economic uncertainty. Rich will speak to loans in more detail
in just a few minutes, but a couple of notes on the provision and on our allowance. Of the $48 million in provision,
approximately two-thirds is related to a modest deterioration in the CECL macroeconomic factors, and only one-
third is related to our growth in portfolio changes that occurred during the quarter. To be clear, we are not
signaling a change in our credit performance.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
With respect to our allowance of 91 basis points of total loans, it's important to note that excluding our historically
low loss niche loans, primarily the premium finance loans, our allowance is 142 basis points of total core loans.
You can see that on table 12 of the press release where we provide some detail.
Deposit growth for the quarter was approximately $105 million. The continued rise in rates is clearly making
deposit gathering more challenging. The cost of deposits is rising and nominal changes in deposit mix are
occurring.
Interest-bearing deposit costs of 130 basis points for the fourth quarter were up 66 basis points. We anticipate
continued increases in both the Fed funds rate and the rates associated with the bank's loan and deposit activity.
Increases in loan yields, however, at this point in the cycle continue to exceed the change in deposit costs given
our asset sensitive position. Our deposit betas and the increase in deposit costs to-date are in line with our
expectations. Currently, the beta on our interest-bearing deposits is approximately 25%. We anticipate an
interest-bearing deposit beta of approximately 40% to 45% over the full cycle of interest rate changes.
Our securities book was up $1.5 billion in the quarter, as we believe yields are becoming more attractive and
represent the opportunity for reasonable longer-term returns. At year-end, liquidity remained strong with
approximately $2.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. As discussed last quarter, our securities book is split
almost equally between available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, while the AFS valuation swings during the year
were significant. As Ed pointed out, the bank's tangible book value was up for both the fourth quarter and the year
to $61 a share. Those of you who follow us know that the tangible book value per share is an important metric for
us. It has increased every year since going public in 1996.
With respect to rate sensitivity in the margin, although our GAAP position is trending down, we remain asset-
sensitive and well-positioned to continue to benefit from rising interest rates. We believe each 25 basis point
increase in the Fed funds rate at this point in the cycle will result in approximately $30 million in pre-tax net
interest income on an annualized basis, and an improvement in the margin of 5 to 8 basis points. Note this is
down slightly from our prior positioning.
To be more specific on the margin, as Ed mentioned, that was 3.73% in the fourth quarter, an improvement of 38
basis points. With rates rising, we continue to achieve and in some cases exceed the margin improvement
discussed or projected on our prior calls. At this point, depending on the impact of competition for deposits and
the pace of additional Fed increases, we believe our margin will approach 4% at some point during the first
quarter and has not yet peaked.
Conversely, while we clearly benefit from rising rates, as discussed on our last call, the bank entered into several
interest rate collars in the third quarter of 2022. Further, early in this quarter, first quarter of 2023, the bank
entered into additional derivatives contracts with the intent of reducing the variability of the margin in a lower
interest rate environment. Our approach has been to leg into these contracts and we anticipate that additional
activity on this front is likely. You can see table 8 in the press release for more information on our GAAP position.
As you know, we also view our mortgage business as a natural hedge as it is proven to perform well in lower rate
environments when margins tend to be pressured. For the fourth quarter, capital ratios were stable to up slightly
and remain appropriate given our risk profile and with the higher net interest margin and currently forecasted loan
growth, the company's earnings are projected to result in organic improvement to our capital levels in the coming
quarters.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
David Alan Dykstra
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Great. Thanks, Tim. As usual, I'll cover some of the noteworthy income statement categories, starting with net
interest income. Tim and Ed have referenced some of these numbers, but we'll just go through it in detail. For the
fourth quarter of 2022, net interest income totaled $456.8 million. That was an increase of $55.4 million as
compared to the third quarter of 2022 and an increase of $160.8 million as compared to the fourth quarter of last
year.
The $55.4 million increase in net interest income as compared to the prior quarter was due to an increase in the
net interest margin and loan growth, as a 38 basis point improvement in the margin brought it to 3.73% in the
fourth quarter, a beneficial increase of 84 basis points on the yield on earning assets and a 22 basis point
increase in the net free funds contribution, combined with the negative impact of a 68 basis point increase on the
rate paid on liabilities resulted in that improved net interest margin.
The increase in the yield on earning assets in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior quarter was primarily
due to an 87 basis point improvement on loan yields and higher liquidity management asset yields as the
company earned higher short-term yields on its interest-bearing deposits held at banks and its investment
securities portfolio.
The increase in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior quarter
was driven by a 66 basis point increase in the rates paid on the interest-bearing deposits. Tim already went
through the deposit beta, so I will let you refer to his comments on that.
Turning to the provision for credit losses, Wintrust recorded a provision for credit losses of $47.6 million in the
fourth quarter compared to a provision of $6.4 million in the prior quarter and a $9.3 million provision expense
recorded in the year-ago quarter. The higher provision expense in the fourth quarter was primarily a result of less
favorable macroeconomic environment conditions, including wider projected credit spreads and less favorable
commercial real estate price index data included in the economic forecast that we use.
Stronger loan growth also contributed to provision expense for the quarter. Rich will talk about credit in more
detail, but I should note that the current quarter's net charge-offs, the mix of classified loans, and the delinquency
data all remained relatively stable or better and really pretty good. So those factors really did not have a
significant impact on the level of the fourth quarter's provision for credit losses expense. And as Tim said, this is
not the larger expense level. It's not a signaling of any specific issues. It's really a function of the macroeconomic
forecast that we used in our CECL models.
Turning to other noninterest income and noninterest expense. In the noninterest income section, our wealth
management revenue was down $2.4 million from the prior quarter and was at the level of $30.7 million for the
quarter. Decline in revenues for this quarter were primarily related to less fees associated with our tax-deferred
like-kind exchange business which had been very strong in the prior quarters and slowed just a bit in the fourth
quarter.
Consistent with overall industry trends and the impact of relatively higher home mortgage rates, our mortgage
banking operation experienced a revenue decline of $9.8 million from the third quarter due to lower loan
origination volumes and lower production margins during the quarter. We expect mortgage origination volumes to
continue to be low in the first quarter due to the rate environment and the seasonal purchasing trends, but it's still
an important part of our business and we expect it to pick up some volume when the spring buying season starts
in the second quarter.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
The company recorded net losses on investment securities of approximately $6.7 million during the fourth quarter,
compared to a $3.1 million net loss in the prior quarter, as market conditions and equity valuations continued to
affect a portion of our securities portfolio.
Other noninterest income totaled $19.3 million in the fourth quarter, which was up $3.5 million from the amount
recorded in the prior quarter. A contributing reason for the increase in this category is that the company recorded
approximately $1.1 million of higher BOLI income, which was primarily related to higher earnings on BOLI
investments that support certain deferred compensation plan benefits. And so, I should note that net that $1.1
million increase in the BOLI income has a similar offsetting increase in compensation expense during the quarter.
So they sort of net as part of net income goes, but there is an increase in both of those categories for the quarter.
Additionally, prior quarter had a negative valuation adjustment of approximately $2 million on our early buyout
loans, certain early buyout loans, whereas the prior quarter – the prior quarter had a $2 million negative valuation
on the early buyout loans whereas the current quarter had an insignificant adjustment.
Turning to noninterest expenses. Noninterest expenses totaled $307.8 million in the fourth quarter and were up a
little over $11 million when compared to the prior quarter total of $296.5 million. The primary reason for the
increase was due to higher compensation-related expenses and a variety of other less significant contributing
factors.
Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by approximately $4.2 million in the fourth quarter as
compared to the prior quarter of the year. Relative to the prior quarter, the increase of $2.8 million of higher
salaries expenses and $2.3 million of higher employee benefits expense were the primary causes. As to the
higher salaries expenses, which was caused by $1.8 million of increased deferred compensation costs as I
mentioned, partially related to the underlying BOLI investments where we recorded the income on the other
noninterest income part of the income statement.
And on the employee benefit side, those are almost exclusively related to higher health insurance claims during
the quarter. So, elevated in the fourth quarter generally as people try to use up some of their health benefits
before the deductibles reset. Also, although a smaller change from the quarter, commissions and incentive
compensation was slightly lower as mortgage banking commissions were reduced. Although we did have some
higher bonus and long-term incentive compensation accruals for the quarter related to the higher earnings level,
but the net was a reduction in that category.
Advertising and marketing expenses decreased by $2.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter.
As we've discussed on previous calls, this category of expenses tends to be lower in the fourth and first quarters
of the year due to less marketing and sponsorship expenditures related to various major and minor league
baseball sponsorships and less summertime sponsorship events that we obviously don't do in the wintertime.
Professional fees increased by approximately $1.7 million in the fourth quarter. These fluctuations were primarily
related to some consulting services that we utilized in conjunction with the implementation of various financial and
customer related processing systems.
Other miscellaneous expense increased by $4.8 million during the quarter, which included a $1.1 million
additional charitable contributions and a variety of other normal operational fluctuations, none of which I think are
worth noting for this call. Our efficiency ratio declined to 55% for the fourth quarter from 58% in the third quarter
as our expenses did not increase at a rate commensurate with the increase in revenue.

And with that, I will turn it over to Rich to cover credit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Dave. As noted earlier, our credit performance for the fourth quarter was very solid from a number of
perspectives. As detailed on slide 8 of the deck, loan growth for the quarter was $1 billion or 11% annualized, an
outstanding result. And similar to the past few quarters, we continue to see loan growth across the portfolio.
Specifically, commercial real estate grew by $373 million, commercial loans bolstered by a strong quarter end
leasing grew by $290 million, commercial premium finance had another solid quarter, up $136 million, and
residential real estate loans were up $137 million. Year-over-year, we saw a total loan growth of $5 billion or 15%
net of PPP loans, a very productive 2022.
As noted on our prior earnings calls, we continue to see very solid momentum in our core C&I and CRE portfolios.
Pipelines have been very strong throughout the year and we saw that materialize into increased outstandings
over the past several quarters. In addition, ongoing disruptions within the competitive banking landscape continue
to work to our benefit. Also, commercial premium finance had a very strong 2022 with increased outstandings of
close to $1 billion year-over-year. We anticipate this momentum will continue into 2023.
While we are optimistic about loan growth for this year, we would anticipate that the pace of growth may trend
closer to the middle of our guidance of mid- to high-single digits for a number of reasons. While Wintrust Life
Finance grew by $1.1 billion during 2022, the rapid increases in rates during the past year have affected that pace
of growth. This portfolio grew $86 million in the fourth quarter versus $396 million in the third quarter. We would
anticipate the slower rate of growth will continue in this higher rate environment.
Also, increases in commercial line utilization, excluding leases and mortgage warehouse lines as detailed on slide
17, have flattened during the fourth quarter, possibly reflecting a more cautious business sentiment. As a result,
while we continue to be diligent about the possibility of a business recession, we believe our diversified portfolio
and position within the competitive landscape will allow us to grow within our guidance of mid- to high-single digits
and maintain our credit discipline.
From a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide 16, we continue to see strong credit performance across the
portfolio. This can be seen in a number of ways. Non-performing loans remain stable at 26 basis points or $101
million, compared to $98 million in the third quarter. And as Ed noted earlier, of this total, $17 million was related
to Wintrust Life loans which went 90 days past maturity. Roughly half these loans have since been paid off, the
balance of which are fully secured and we would anticipate full repayment from the carrier shortly.
Overall, NPLs continue to be at very low levels and we are still confident about the solid metrics in the portfolio.
Charge-offs through the quarter were $5.1 million or 5 basis points, up slightly from the previous quarter. Charge-
offs for 2022 totaled $20.3 million or 5 basis points. Finally, as detailed in slide 16, we saw stable levels in our
special mention and substandard loans with no meaningful signs of additional economic stress at the customer
level.
That concludes my comments on credit, and I'll turn it to Ed to wrap up.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Thanks, Murph. Well, year-end is always a good time to review not just the fourth quarter and the year-to-date but
further review the entire body of work over a longer period of time versus our stated goals that the company has
had. Let's go back 10 years, now if you just go back 30 years results versus peers, it'd be about the same.
Increasing tangible book value, we think is extremely important. One of the goals we always looked at. As Tim
noted earlier, we've increased it every year since we went public. Eight-year CAGR of 8% is pretty good, given
last year had been kind of tough but we still were up above – we were positive.
Earnings growth 16% at 10-year CAGR; asset growth, 12%; dividends paid, 22%; stock price only 9%, go figure.
So in 10 years under review, we saw a bit of everything. High rates, low rates, pandemics, you name it, Wintrust
has thrived during all of these. It's a testament to our business model we employ and the people who work at
Wintrust. When rates were low, our mortgage company helped pick up the slack and net interest margin
compression – of the net interest margin compression that occurred. The lower rates [indiscernible] (00:23:47) the
more we increased our positive gap, rates have risen mortgages has died down. I say this because I'm often
asked, well, you're a mortgage bank. No, we're not. It's just part of what we do. This is an orchestra here, not a
combo. This is a big orchestra. They're all sorts of different parts. At times, they all kick in. At times, they don't
kick in. Mortgage is still an extremely important thing – important offering that we have, but – It's not doing well
now, but it will do well as rates come back down.
Now with the margin up, we're embarking on, as Tim mentioned, locking in this increased margin for a longer
period of time. All of the above has been accomplished when we attained our exceptional credit statistics.
[indiscernible] (00:24:43) concentration skill has also served us well both in deposit and the asset side. Extremely
well diversified and it's something that always works when something isn't working.
We're a growth company that takes what the market gives us. Acquisitions or organic growth or – have both
worked very well for us. Based on the above and many more points, one has to wonder why we consistently
traded at a discount to our peers. I have to put that in there. I'm sorry. [indiscernible] (00:25:10) more of the same.
Our margins should continue to increase as the remainder of asset portfolio reprices and liability costs increase at
a lesser rate. [indiscernible] (00:25:20) in our future [indiscernible] (00:25:23) locking in higher margin as we
mentioned in today's comment, it is already underway. Loan pipelines are still strong but been lower historically as
Murph pointed out, and we keep our guidance the same but are focusing on the lower side of that. Credit stats
were stellar but we're prepared for additional [indiscernible] (00:25:38) Moody's, which we had one this quarter.
And this is still being evaluated in all aspects of our business. Pricing is still an issue, especially given stock price.
Now [indiscernible] (00:25:52) American business is on track for first or second quarter closing. In short, we like
where we stand.
With all that, I think you can ensure our best efforts going forward, and we'll be consistently good with all the
major owners of this or that wish to tie up in this company, I'm not going to do anything stupid. In fact, we hope to
thrive no matter what the economic cycle is, and where we're at in it to share our best efforts in this. And time for
some questions, please.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC
Capital Markets. Your question, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes. Can you hear me all right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. How are you, Jon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, good. Jon Arfstrom from RBC. You guys – the numbers look good here, the one that surprised me a little
bit was the provision. And it seems like you've touched on it and alluded to it, but what do you want the message
for us to be going forward? Feels like it's going to pull back, it feels like it pulls back with a little bit slower loan
growth as well. But do you guys view this as more of a onetime step up and we go back to a normal pace or how
should we think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I think, Jon, the CECL, as you know, is sort of a life of long concept and if we have loan growth, the
provision will go up. But if the economic scenario stayed exactly the same, you'd have no additional provision in
the next quarter, per se, for that. So it really depends. If the – and the economists obviously change their forecast
frequently, but if that forecast gets better next quarter, you could expect the provision to come down. If it gets
worse, it would probably stay elevated. So it's really a function of where the economy is going.
But as Tim and Rich and Ed and I have all said, there's nothing specific here that we're pointing to that we think is
a current problem in the portfolio. This is just how commercial real estate price index forecast and how Baa credit
spreads and GDP and all those forecasts got moderately worse in the forecasts that we – economic forecast we
use. So it really is a function of the CECL modeling and not a function of us seeing deterioration in our credit. So if
you can tell me where that crystal ball is next quarter as far as economic forecast, you could know which way our
provisions probably going to go.

Okay. Sure, that'll be in the transcript, Ed. The other question I have is on the margin. I think I understand what
you guys are saying, but if the Fed, it feels like you're trying to protect downside but if the Fed bumps a couple
more times and then holds it for a while, what could happen to your margin? Are you – you guys are talking about
a 4% level, but then Ed, you kind of alluded to floating a little bit higher above 4%. What do you think about the
margin outlook in that kind of a scenario where the Fed is not cutting?

Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, they're raising. Well, it should be as Tim said, $30 million on annual basis per quarter. Eventually the – there
have been a lagging on the [indiscernible] (00:29:42) able to lag on the deposits, purchase is going to catch up to
that overall beta. We still have a lot of assets that are repricing right now. So, if you think about premium finance
businesses, every prices over the course of a year. So other assets will do the same. We're monitoring this very
carefully as we lay into these derivatives to help maintain the margin.
So it's hard to say where it's going to be as [indiscernible] (00:30:11). Some of the derivatives, we give up, we
give up some upside related to the downside. But I think that no matter how it's go, margin will continue to go up.
If we can predict something in the 3.75% to 4% range long term, depending on where rates are at, that'd be a
good thing but it will take a lot more derivatives to do that. And we're not really good at market timing. So we'll –
when that happens, the mortgages will kick in and life would be good again in that regard. So it kind of has some
internal hedges too but Tim, do you want to talk about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think Jon in general, we would expect the margin to sort of top out after the Fed stops raising rates. And
so, whether that's a quarter or two or whether we moderate that with some thoughtful decisions around the
derivatives, that's kind of what we're thinking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
But yeah, Jon, I think what we've said here is that we expect the margin to approach 4% and as Fed raises some
more, it may pop a little over 4%. But then we think, given existing competitive pressures and the existing yield
curve that if they stop raising that we can kind of hold it there if all else being stable, because as Ed said, we have
a lot of asset beta left, too. Everyone talks about the deposit betas. But if you look at our life insurance premium
finance portfolio, as you know, that those reset once a year. And if you go back a year, they're based generally off
of a 12-month LIBOR or 12-month treasury rate. And those rates were 58 basis points a year ago, if you look at
the page 25 of our earnings release. Those rates are up over 400 basis points. So, there's a lot of repricing that

happens there. The property and casualty premium finance loans, our fixed rate loans, and so they reprice over
the course of a year. So, that's a third of our portfolio that has pretty good deposits or asset beta changes left that
we think will substantially offset the deposit beta. So, we feel like we can kind of hold the margin if they go higher
and then plateau.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
How are you doing, David?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good, good. You guys are bucking the trend here on the deposit side showing deposit growth. A lot of the banks
continue to have outflows. What are your expectations on the deposit flows? And then also, mix shift hasn't
changed too much as you alluded to. Do you see much mix shift incoming in the next couple of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, David, it's Tim. The deposit activity has been lumpy both in and out, I would add. We've been pretty
disciplined with our pricing and cautious about getting ahead of the market. We're responding to promotional
activity to retain our clients and, frankly, we've got some higher deposit cost built into our projections. We think we
operate in good markets with a lot of deposit potential. We've typically outperformed our peers in terms of growth.
Even though we're one or two in deposit share in many of our markets, we still only have 6%, 7%, 8% overall
growth in Chicago and Milwaukee. So, our multi-charter brand and approach, we think, will help us and we think
we're holding our own.
I'd add sort of an interesting fact here. During the last quarter, or two quarters rather, we've helped clients
purchase almost $1 billion worth of short-term treasuries that previously had been held as deposits at the bank.
And as the gap between deposit pricing and treasuries starts to narrow again, we expect we'll get an opportunity
at some of that money. But we don't – I mean, we'll protect the mix as best we can. Clearly, people are moving
out of DDA in some cases for the rates in money markets or savings or CD products. So I think that's possible

that'll continue. But I can tell you, we're intensely focused on adding deposits and relationships, and we still think
we've got terrific market opportunities. So, we're going to hold our own and stay at it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good. Thanks, Tim. And then my follow-up here relates to the amount of cash you have versus deposits. A lot of
your peers don't have much cash and they've really had to increase FHLB borrowings and use of higher-cost
CDs. Your cash, as I see it, is down to just under 6% of deposits. You're up over 10% at September 30. Do you
monitor that? Is that something that you have a target you want to keep above a certain cash level, just in case
you do get some deposit runoff and you don't have to chase yields?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think we're sort of comfortable where the cash is now. I remember last quarter at the end of the third
quarter, we had $1 billion extra sitting in cash because we had done some borrowings at the Federal Home Loan
Bank that we had indicated we would invest at the beginning of the quarter, and we did that. So I think if you look
at it, we were in the high-3s and then we went to the high-2s if you adjust for that $1 billion that we invested
shortly after the end of the third quarter. And now we're around $2 billion. We like that position. We sort of focus
on loan-to-deposit ratio of 85 to 90. We're slightly over that, but still in a range we're comfortable with.
And then we were lagging on investing that securities portfolio. In the past, we just been investing in the 1%
range, was not that prudent, and so we were patient. And then, we have invested now that rates are higher. And
we think that part of the remixing of the balance sheet to protect against down rates is to invest in some of the
longer-term security portion of the balance sheet. So we think – I think we like where we're at right now as far as
the mix of cash, securities, and loans. And as we grow that mix will probably stay about the same.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Liquidity has always been very important to us. And we expect our deposit costs to go up, but we have a lot
of room there where given the 40% beta we talked about, we're not there yet. At the same time, the assets should
move and the real trick is going to be protecting the margin when this peeks out and, you know, black swan hits
and it's going to drop like a rock no matter what the environment is. And you have to be prepared for that too. So
we are – we're vigilant.
We're constantly looking at it and liquidity is extremely important to us. Don't forget, we're kind of a bank 100
because of liquidity, not because of credit. It was the largest bank probably at the time and the liquidity is still
important to us. We monitor it very, very carefully.

Hey. Good morning. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Hi, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
How are you doing? Dave, the 4% margin roughly that you're talking about. I guess, what does that map to in
terms of loan yields? Right? You've got the premium finance book that keeps this kind of got a backward lag. But
is it somewhere in the mid-6 – it feels like it's kind of somewhere in the mid-6s is kind of where your loan yields
are going to go?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
You know, probably at mid-6s approaching 7. Right now, I would say, but if rates keep going up and the mix of the
business changes, I mean, that's a variable, but that's – we don't give guidance – give specific guidance, but
that's the right zip code.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, there was a comment in the press release that just talked about additional improvements in
efficiency. Maybe you could throw a little more color around that? You're obviously in a good spot in exiting the
year in the mid-50s. But how would you think about that ratio playing out, appreciating that mortgages in
recessionary levels? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. So mortgage – lower mortgages obviously help the efficiency ratio. But the expense side of the equation,
that will have some additional expenses in 2023. The FDIC rates are up. Compensation cost will go up a little bit
as we push through salary raises and the like later this quarter. But I think with the inflation and the FDIC and all
sorts of things, generally, you're probably slightly above mid-single-digit growth in expenses. And if you add on
the acquisition we're planning, it's probably high-single-digit expense growth for the entire year. First quarter, it
probably doesn't grow too much on the expense side, we don't think. But then as we add in the acquisition, when
that closes, that will add to it and then salaries will kick in [indiscernible] (00:40:05) margin. The margin is going to
increase substantially. And we think that the mid-50 efficiency ratio we have probably drifts down closer to 50 and
[indiscernible] (00:40:21) even do better than that. But the increase in the revenue will more than offset the
expenses as we look at now to continue to drive the efficiency ratio lower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
We continue to look at cutting costs also in different areas, mortgage area being one. And we believe that that
overhead ratio, which I like to look at, it was higher this quarter. But if you take out the security loss, you get
closer to 1.5. We have to grow also. And we have to invest in growing the bank, which is part of the increase in
expenses. Hopefully, that growth will get our – that overhead ratio back below 1.5. Hard to do without mortgages
kicking in. But between the acquisition and – of Rothschild and additional asset growth, we'd like to get that

number down below 1.5. I know the – that'll help the efficiency ratio also, but if – I never considered the efficiency
ratio, and now it's doing well, well, why your efficiency ratio is good because the margins are up, but the net
overhead ratio, we need to continue to get below 1.5 and we're working very hard to do that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Just one more. Dave, on the covered calls, obviously that number's been bouncing around, but how active are
you going to be there? And then guess maybe help us with what makes it go on either side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, a couple of calls. As you know, we do those, again, to protect against a down rate environment and
enhance return on those securities. And if you're doing them on mortgage backs of rates, all the securities pay off
fairly quickly. And so, you get that extra revenue. And our analysis has been over a long period of time that you're
better off by writing the calls and getting that revenue, and even have to reinvest usually a better trade. But as I
talked about a little bit earlier, when we're talking about the liquidity position, we invested $1 billion of that liquidity
into securities in the fourth quarter and moved some calls against that. And you can see on our balance sheet,
those were called in and we reinvested them, so it – at a decent rate here in the in the first quarter. So, it depends
on volatility, and it depends on where rates – or where the yield curves at. But the little bit outsized from normal
given the size of the investment purchases that we had, but my guess is that in a normal environment that
number is somewhere in the $2 million to $10 million range. And it really it drives a lot of volatility, so it's hard to
tell until you get to the point where you invest in securities, what the yield curve shape is, and what the market
volatility is, but somewhere in that range would seem reasonable to me.

opportunities of the loan portfolio in 2023, I think it's something I overlooked. So, I appreciate that. And maybe for
a question, circling back I think, with Jon's question on protecting the margin, Ed you kind of threw out 3.75% to
4%. I just want to make sure, is that the floor this strategy you think can produce? And if rates go down 100 basis
points or all the way back to zero, I just think that's an important kind of comment there and I want to make sure I
understand what you were saying there.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Yeah, just to give you, Terry, a little bit more detail, I mean, we've entered into a combination of collars and some
receive fixed swaps with terms out three to five years and obviously the impact of those instruments depends on
the interest rate scenario. So, we're trying to take some steps to improve a margin in lower, lower interest rate
environment but it depends on the scenario of how much impact there's going to be.
The other thing, though, it's just not these instruments. If you look at table 8, you can see that in various scenarios
both up and down we've sort of reduced the variability of the net interest income. And so we're mindful of trying to
operate independent of the interest rate environment at the higher level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, so – and Terry I'd add in there, I mean, that would sort of be the goal but we're not going to do all of the
derivatives all at one time. We're going to leg into this diversity as far as the length of these derivative contracts,
as far as how much fixed rate models you put on the books, at what strike price these swaps or collars have.
They all matter.
And I always tell people, our crystal ball isn't perfect. And if you go back 18 months, I think maybe the outlook for
increases in rates was 25 basis points. So, the economists have put out these forecasts aren't perfect either. So
we're trying to protect the margin, and so we're going to leg into it. So depending on what the curve is and where
we can buy the swaps going forward as we leg into it from diversifying the risk perspective, we'd like to be able to
lock it into the upper 3s to 4%, but it really sort of is dependent upon how fast rates move and where that longer
end of the curve settles out at. So,...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
That's our goal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
...it's a lofty goal. We're not saying we've locked that in yet, but that's what we'd like to do if the market sort of
allows us to do that over time with these derivatives.
[indiscernible] (00:46:41)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I was going to say it's great. I mean, these are sort of unprecedented interest rate margins for us right now.
We have not been at 4% in our history. And so, and we prepared for it. We've managed for it, and we're enjoying
that and we just would like to attempt to maintain it going forward through balance sheet position and derivatives
but it's going to – we're going to leg into it.

Timothy S. Crane A

Obviously, when relationship managers feel like they can't take care of their clients, we look like a good home.
We'll continue to pursue those opportunities as they arise. But it's not a large team or a number you're going to

open, Ben.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hi. Thanks, guys. Most of the questions around the margin have been answered, but it reminds me of an adage
my dad used to say, you can't go broke by taking profit. It makes sense you're going to – you're willing to take a
little off the upside table to protect to the downside. So, in essence, you're kind of manufacturing to some degree
a revenue line. But when you think about revenue relative to expenses, let's say, there is that kind of the
downside scenario economically or a black swan event, is there anything in the net – noninterest expenses that
you can cut abruptly or anything to that extent that you kind of match out the two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, on the noninterest expense side, I mean, we're kind of a growth company. So we don't plan to cut but as
that – so that's a big factor there is – and we saw this in the past when rates dropped precipitously, but the black
swan event is that the mortgages kicked in dramatically. We had a couple of quarters before rates went up where
we had record net income quarters and that's because the mortgage business kicked in. So it's really shifting the

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
mix of the business from spread the business that what happened dramatically to noninterest income business,
which we – would be the mortgage side. So that's the biggest factor, I would say.
And we – it's a business strategy. We think we need to be in the mortgage business because we're not going to
send our customers to some other financial institution for a mortgage. And if we think we're going to do it, we'll do
it with scale, and then we'll do it because we always want to be asset sensitive. And we've said this on other calls,
the degree of asset sensitivity changes. But you always want to be asset sensitive because if you do have
inflation, then your expenses are going to go up. And then how do you cover that increase in expenses? And for a
bank like us, it's getting more in the margin. So you should always stay asset sensitive to be able to cover the
inflationary cost. And if that's the case, then the mortgage business is a natural business hedge. And so that's
how we look at it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got you. Okay. That's helpful on the strategy. And then some of your, I want to say, larger competitors have
national deals or are involved with other M&A activities themselves, which gives you guys the opportunity to take
clients and share the marketplace. Is there anything you're targeting specifically in terms of loan growth with that
regard? I get that you guys are all encompassing things. You do a lot for a lot of people. But knowing that your
competitors are kind of involved with integration themselves, both side of the Chicago land area, is there anything
that you guys are approaching for 2023 in terms of the strategy to be offensive?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No. we always see opportunities that – the larger banks always have various things that they're getting involved
with whether they're pulling out of a particular asset class or changes in some of their staffing or and those really,
we have been the steady provider in all these different asset classes that we're in. So, the line we use around
here is that we don't jerk the wheel, that we try to be very consistent in the way we underwrite, the way we price,
the way we go to market.
And as a result, we saw this at the back half of this year where, certain banks were trying to change the way their
balance sheets looked and we were able to take advantage of those. So our job is just to be very consistent, very
steady and it just – over the 30-plus years that Wintrust have been in existence, that's really our – been our model
is to take what is available in the marketplace. And usually that's a result of the bigger banks doing things like you
refer to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. For example, one of the large banks, we got the largest bank in Chicago, has stated they're going to do a
safe deposit banks. That's an opportunity for us because all people still like safe deposit bank. We got them. They
don't cost much to run. We are now offering – we're going to be offering free safe deposit banks for a period time
to get new people in.
Those things like that mean a lot of people. It's a pain in the neck for them to change banks. But the big banks
seem to step on it themselves and allow us the opportunity to work through that stuff. And we have great products
as indicated by the [ph] Greenwich Awards (00:53:07) and the what's [indiscernible] (00:53:09)?

And has that bottomed in your view and outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. The production margin was hovering down closer to 1% in the fourth quarter. We expect in the first quarter
here at 1.5% is a reasonable range, which is clearly lower than normal. But you also have to understand the
production is very low right now. As we showed in the slide deck, the originations for sale were just a little over
$400 million. So, actually the majority of our revenue in the mortgage business now is the servicing income of
roughly $11 million.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
So first quarter, we expect to be slow again, although applications are still coming in. There's still purchase activity
out there and a little bit of a refinance activity. But over 80% of that $400 million is really purchase volume. But it's
competitive out there as people are just trying to get the volumes in, so it's squeezing the production margins. So
it's very small, but it has become such a small piece of the revenue stream that given these higher rates and
seasonality in the last couple of quarters, I think we're about as low as we're going to go as far as the production
revenue. I think we'll continue to at least have what we have now. And as I said on my comments, I think as we
get in the second quarter and the buying season picks up and people get a little bit more used to the new level of
mortgage rates and digest them, I think we'll start to see pickup in the second and third quarters.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
...gravy for us, too. That's just gravy with a higher rate environment [indiscernible] (00:55:40) gravy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I agree. I agree. Okay. And then on the deposit strategy, I saw a lot of deposits growth came
from savings and CDs. I was curious if you could provide details on your CD strategy as far as what prices you
book demand in the fourth quarter and as far as terms, six months, three months, et cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Rates are trending up, particularly promotional rates toward 4%. Most clients are still not willing to go long.
So you're seeing terms from nine months through – call it two years, but most of it kind of around a year. And the
alternative is there are obviously promotional money market and savings rates that are also available for people
that don't want to lock into a term product.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
And the other thing I think I'd point you to is on table 2 of our earnings release, we do show the CD rates by
maturity. So you can kind of see how they roll off. Most of them right now our plus or minus 2% on average. And
so – but the promotional rates are as Tim talked about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then for 2023, how confident are you in your ability to generate operating deposits into DDAs for this
year? Do you think you're expecting very little growth from those categories and those interest-bearing accounts?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Well, no. We're working awfully hard to continue to add clients, and as we bring new clients on, they bring
deposits that include their operating business. We've talked on prior calls about how nicely our treasury
management business is performing. And so, again, it's lumpy as there's kind of large inflows and outflows, but
we plan to continue to add clients and deposits.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
A question, a couple housekeeping items, on the expense side, I think you alluded to a mid-single digit
expectation for the full year. I think you're about 4% for 2022, which is pretty good in the inflationary environment.
But what was the expectation again for 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I was saying probably mid-to-high single digits or the middle of that range sort of just normally with an
acquisition that probably gets into the high single digits for the full year. First quarter will probably less because
the acquisition of – the pending acquisition. If it's in there, it will be the end of the first quarter or early second
quarter. But so it won't have much impact. And so some of the increases are later in the year as we talked in our
comments, the second and third quarters tend to be higher for certain expense categories, particularly
sponsorships and marketing. And then salary costs, we do salary increase effective February 1, so that will
impact a little bit in the first quarter, but more so the second quarter.
So, probably not a lot of growth in the first quarter, but as the year goes on for all those other reasons, probably
mid-to-high single digits. But again, we would expect that with the leverage and the growth in the balance sheet
and with the higher margin more than offset that expense growth.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Right. I guess we get back into your comments on the efficiency ratio, still seeing improvement despite a
reasonably higher expense run rate. So, just to catch up on the margin again, did you have a December average
for the month?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We don't really – haven't disclosed that and we don't want to get in the position of doing that. I think what
you can see is in the past we told you we'd be around 3.70% for the fourth quarter, and we were and I think we're
pretty confident in our guidance for the full quarter of the first quarter. So I think we'll leave it at that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Fair enough. And then just the last one on the tax rate, any expectation that that's going to change
anywhere off of 27%, 27%, 27.5%, is that a reasonable assumption for 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. 26.5% to 27% is a reasonable assumption. It bounced around a little bit because of the – what we noted in
the press release with the $2 million expense in the third quarter and $1.7 million of that reversing in the fourth
quarter related to some minimum taxes with our Canadian stuff. But you take those out and 26.5% to 27% seems
like a reasonable rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.

rock, but we're going to make it. So if you have any other questions, please contact any of the speakers today and
