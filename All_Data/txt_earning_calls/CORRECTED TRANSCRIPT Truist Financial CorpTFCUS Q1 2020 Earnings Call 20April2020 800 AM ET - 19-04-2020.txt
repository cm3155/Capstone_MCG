Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Ryan. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our call. I certainly hope you and your families
are safe and well in this difficult environment we're all living in. I want to take a minute before we get into the
numbers to just talk about culture, because I believe now more than ever culture matters most of all of the things
we can talk about. So, you've heard us say that our purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities.
This is absolutely a critical time for us to live out that purpose. Our mission is focusing on our clients, our
teammates, and our stakeholders, in that order, and we do that very, very seriously every day.
Our values are to be trustworthy, caring, operate as one team, focus on success and ultimately happiness for our
teammates. We are focusing, during this environment, number on – excuse me – the health and safety of our
teammates. We are pleased to have about 35,000 of our 58,000 teammates are able to work remotely. We are
spending a lot of time supporting our clients, particularly on the Payroll Protection Program. We're spending a lot

of energy and focus supporting our communities through our Truist share of $25 million philanthropic donation
that we did early in the cycle.
I'll tell you that our teammates are working really, really hard. They're working 24/7 in many cases. They're
working very, very closely together. It's incredible to see the kind of positive results that we're getting, particularly
like in the PPP program where our people were able to stand up literally overnight an automated portal to allow
our clients to access automatically with us in terms of getting their applications in.
Our teammates are bonding faster than we would ever have expected. And I can say to you today that our culture
at Truist is really, really strong. If you're following on the presentation, I'm on slide 5. Just as a reminder, after the
combination, we are the sixth largest US commercial bank by assets and market value. We have a very strong
number 2 weighted average deposit market share in the Top 20 MSAs. We have 12 million households, 58,000
teammates.
We are very well positioned, we think, to achieve our purpose. We are recognized as one of the highest-rated
financial institutions and we're continuing to grow loans and deposits, particularly in this period of flight to quality.
Daryl's going to cover a lot of information about our very strong capital and liquidity in just a bit. But I would point
out that our diversification is a real strength. We are very diversified in products, services, and geographies.
On slide 6, we talk about some of the things we're doing with regard to the crisis. Like others, we have been
providing payment relief assistance, including forbearance, deferrals, extensions, other ways we can help our
clients. We've already done over 300,000 accommodations for consumers; 16,000 for our commercial clients.
We've temporarily waived ATM surcharges, and we're uniquely offering a 5% cash back on qualifying card
purchases for important basic needs.
We're real pleased that we've been able to continue to allow [indiscernible] (00:04:50) interventions with our
clients in terms of particular needs they have. We're fortunate that 90% of our branches have drive-throughs, so
we've been able to keep those branches open in terms of activity. We've been really focused on the Paycheck
Protection Program. Our average loan amount is about $323,000. We've been authorized for 32,000 companies,
representing about 1 million employees. And we're expecting funding to be a little more than $10 billion on the first
round, and it will likely be more on the second round if it is, in fact, approved.
We're providing financial relief programs for our small businesses and many other ways also. And we've been
able to fund without hesitation extensive line draws for our commercial clients.
For our teammates, we've awarded $1,200 coronavirus relief bonuses to about 78% of our teammates making
less than $100,000 a year. We've been very aggressive in providing work from home and other alternative work
strategies for our teammates to provide safety for them. We also increased our on-site special rate pay for those
that have to be at work with critical roles at $6.25 special pay for those on hourly, and $50 a day for those that are
not. Our Truist Foundation is contributing $4 for every $1 that our Truist teammates donate our One Team Fund,
which helps our teammates that are in financial hardship and need assistance.
For our communities, we announced earlier, $25 million philanthropic contributions. This is really going a long way
to help. We donated $1 million to each of the CDC Foundation and Johns Hopkins. And our Truist Foundation
donated $3 million to local United Way organizations.
On page 7, just a few financial highlights. We did have $5.6 billion in our taxable-equivalent revenue. Our
adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $1.18 billion. Diluted earnings per share on an

adjusted basis was $0.87. Our return on tangible common equity adjusted was 15.5%, which is very strong in this
environment. And our adjusted efficiency ratio was 53.4%. So we feel really good about that.
Our January and February were, like a lot of people, really strong. And then we, of course, ran into all the
challenges that we're all experiencing because of COVID-19. Interestingly, insurance and mortgage continued to
have strong performance throughout the entire quarter.
Our asset quality, as Clarke will describe to you, is actually very good right now, but we know that's the calm
before the storm and that's why we added a strong $893 million of provision in anticipation of the challenges that
we know we will face. We have a tight focus on our teammates and our clients and our communities, which we
believe is our job number one right now.
If you'll go to slide 8, just a couple of the unusual items this quarter. We know it's a little messy, but we've got the
issue of the merger and the COVID impact. Our merger-related charges are $107 million before tax, about $0.06
negative impact after tax. The incremental operating expenses, these are the ones that provide future benefits but
they're not a part of the ongoing run rate, so we call them out separately, and that's $74 million or $0.04 a share.
And then, the COVID impact in terms of cost and foregoing revenues is about $71 million or $0.04. So, there
really is, in my view, about $0.14 of unusual items which gets you to the $0.87.
If you go to deck 9 – slide 9, in loans and leases, it's been an interesting period. You can see that our first quarter
average loans was $301 billion, but by the end of the period, it was $319 billion. Obviously, we had a surge at the
end of March. We had about $18 billion in drawdowns, that continued into early part of April. We had another
about $1.4 billion, and then it kind of subsided and it's been relatively flat since then. We do expect substantial
PPP funding. That said, we have in process about $10 billion in committed loans we expect will be drawn down
relatively soon.
In terms of the market, I know everybody wants to know what's going to happen. I do, too, but the truth is we just
don't know. It depends, obviously, on the depth and the length of the health crisis as we work through that, and
then how that has the knock-off effect with regard to the economy. The good news is, going into this the economy
was very strong. The bad news is small businesses will really struggle to recover from this. Still, I would say to
you, Americans are resilient and I believe our country is likely to outperform in the worst expectations.
If you look at deposits on page 10, the same kind of thing. Our average balances were $334 billion. It popped up
to $350 billion, as we had an increase of $15 billion during that period of time. About $7 billion of that was line
draws, but then we also had some seasonal increases and some flight to quality deposits that moved in, which we
were very pleased to see. Our total average cost of deposits decreased by 6 basis points, which we're very happy
to see.
So, let me turn it to Daryl now and let him give you some detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I want to talk about the key points from the first quarter
and provide some color on current business conditions.
Turning to slide 11. Net interest margin was 3.58%, up 17 basis points. Purchase accounting contributed 52 basis
points to reported net interest margin. Core net interest margin was 3.06%, down 8 basis points. The decline
reflected the full quarter impact of the merger of equals, lower interest rates, and our liquidity bill in March.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
The yield on loans and leases held for investment increased 8 basis points, as the benefit from purchase
accounting more than offset lower short-term rates. The yield on our portfolio – securities portfolio decreased 3
basis points. We became more asset-sensitive due to floating rate loan growth, expected higher prepayments,
terming out Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and increased non-interest-bearing deposits.
Our loan mix was 55% floating and 45% fixed. Current trends suggest that net interest margin will decline further
from a full quarter impact of lower rates, line draws, PPP funding, and elevated reserves at the Fed. To protect
loan yields, we are implementing floors on all-new production and we continue to aggressively reduce deposit
costs.
Turning to slide 12. Non-interest income increased $563 million, reflecting a full quarter from the merger of
equals. Insurance income increased $39 million or 7.6% versus first quarter 2019 due to higher P&C
commissions, organic growth, strong retention, and increased pricing. Residential mortgage income was strong,
with origination volumes at $11.7 billion. Refi was 56% of origination, and gain on sale margins were 176 basis
points. While forbearance is a potential headwind, that could be offset by higher volume and spreads.
This quarter, several fee income categories were impacted by the pandemic. Investment banking and trading was
impacted by $92 million due to the increase in CVA reserves arising from lower interest rates and wider credit
spreads. As shown on the slide, discretionary actions resulted in lower service charges on deposits and card and
payment related fees. Current trends include the seasonally strong insurance income, strong residential mortgage
production, partially offset by lower service income due to forbearance, lower asset valuations, and lower
purchase flow-in related to COVID-19.
Turning to slide 13. Non-interest expense increased $856 million, reflecting a full quarter impact from the merger.
Merger-related cost included $107 million of merger-related and restructuring charges and $74 million of
incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Discretionary actions in response to COVID-19 impacted
non-interest expense by approximately $65 million, and included a $1,200 bonus to all teammates earning less
than $100,000.
Personnel expense included $44 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. This was
positively impacted by the decrease in the market value of non-qualified plan assets, which is offset in net interest
income and other income. We also updated our intangible valuation. As a result, annualized full year amortization
expense for 2020 was revised to about $660 million. Current trends in expenses include relief measures, such as
special pay for some client-facing teammates, and measures to better protect our teammates, clients and
communities. We continue to have good core expense discipline even in the face of COVID health crisis.
Turning to slide 14. Asset quality remains strong, but economic conditions have deteriorated. Truist will continue
to apply the CECL standard adopted January 1. Our NPA ratio increased 9 basis points to 23 basis points, largely
due to the adoption of CECL and the transition from PCI to PCD. NPLs were 32 basis points of total loans, up 17
basis points from year end, primarily due to the PCI to PCD transition. Adjusting for this transition, our NPA and
NPL ratios were essentially flat from last quarter.
Net charge-offs were 36 basis points of average loans, down 4 basis points. Our provision was $893 million and
reflected the reserving in accordance with CECL. The increased provision was mostly due to a significant loan
growth and scenarios reflecting a weaker economic outlook. The increase also reflected a full quarter of post-
merger activity.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Our allowance coverage ratio was 1.63%. The combination of our allowance and the unamortized fair value mark
remains a very robust 2.71% of total loans. The adoption of CECL resulted in strong coverage ratios at 4.76 times
for net charge-offs and 5.04 times for NPLs. We expect second quarter asset quality matrix to be elevated,
reflecting COVID stress across the loan portfolio.
Turning to slide 15. The table on the left summarizes our exposure to industries we believe are most vulnerable in
the current environment. We have very low exposure, reflecting meaningful diversification from our merger.
Outstanding loans to the group totaled $28.4 billion or 8.9% of loans held for investment at the end of March. Our
oil and gas portfolio is weighted towards lower risk sectors. Outstanding balances on levered loans totaled $10.5
billion or $3.3 billion (sic) [3.3%] of loans held for investment. 42% of our leveraged loans are investment grade or
the equivalent. We are actively managing these portfolios and will continue to make underwriting or risk
acceptance adjustments as appropriate.
Turning to slide 16. The $582 million increase in the ACL from the initial CECL adoption reflects rapidly-evolving
market conditions. Our standard practice is to use three scenarios to inform the CECL allowance, implying
judgment to assign the probability of each scenario. These scenarios include Moody's baseline with implied rates;
one optimistic scenario and one stressed scenario. We also consider heightened industry concerns from the
pandemic effects, together with the impact of government relief packages when calculating the CECL estimate.
Slide 17 adds additional details on our loss estimation approach.
Turning to slide 18. Our capital ratios declined slightly, mostly due to significant balance sheet growth related to
line draws. However, our capital levels remain strong, relative to regulatory levels for well-capitalized banks. Our
CET1 ratio was 9.3%, down 9.5% in the fourth quarter. Our dividend and total payout were 61.4% for the first
quarter. We are taking a prudent approach to capital due to the uncertainty of the economy. Our 2020 CCAR
submission incorporated this impact.
Ending CET1 ratios for the internal baseline and severely adverse scenarios well exceeded regulatory minimums
and internal post-stress policy goals. We intend to utilize the five-year CECL transition for regulatory capital
purposes, which provides a 17 basis point benefit to CET1. We expect to grow capital and serve our clients
throughout this challenging time.
Turning to slide 19, this slide shows the second-best performance among peers under stressed conditions and
from a capital resiliency perspective due to strong PPNR and lower credit losses. A table compares credit loss
reserves reported by Truist and its peers at March 31 to their respective stress losses under 2018 DFAST. We
use stress losses from 2018 as this was the last year the Fed published DFAST results for BB&T and SunTrust.
We think that 2019 would be similar given the improved risk profile and earnings power of the combined
company.
As the column on the right shows, Truist's 35% ratio of credit loss reserves to stress losses is above the peer
average of 33%. However, after layering-in the unamortized fair value marks on the SunTrust portfolio, which
totaled $3.5 billion on March 31, Truist's stress loss coverage increased to 58%. This is a great illustration of how
the merger enhanced the risk profile of both companies and resulted in a defensive balance sheet that is
insulated by purchase accounting marks and CECL reserves. It is also another example of why we believe we are
better together at Truist.
Turning to slide 20. We acted quickly in response to the pandemic to term out short-term borrowings and
increased cash to meet capital funding needs. As such, our liquidity ratios remained strong with an average LCR
of 117%, and a liquid asset buffer of 19.6%. Our access to secure funding sources remains robust. We have

experienced a flight to quality amid recent market volatility with total deposits increasing $15.5 billion, and we
continue to see robust growth this quarter. We have sufficient liquidity to fund our PPP loans from our existing
Fed balances at the Fed. In addition, holding company cash is sufficient to cover 17 months of contractual
expected outflows with no inflows.
We are withdrawing our guidance for 2020 given the uncertainty going forward. For the second quarter, we're
providing guidance on several categories based on linked quarter changes versus the first quarter of 2020. We
expect earning assets to grow in excess of 5% on linked quarter average basis reflecting the increase in loans
from C&I line draws and the PPP program. Total taxable equivalent revenue will be down a few percent linked
quarter reflecting a meaningful decline in net interest margin driven by lower rates, liquidity build, and fee income
pressure as noted earlier.
Core non-interest expense adjusted for the merger amortization and COVID expenses is expected to be flat
linked quarter excluding the adjustment for the non-qualified plan. We're making good progress generating
savings from third party spend and facilities optimization. Depending on the length of the economic downturn, how
deep the downturn goes and how effective the government programs play out will influence scenarios that unfold.
You can see net charge-offs increased throughout the year and possibly add more pressure to build the
allowance. We are also striving to achieve positive operating leverage despite this challenging environment.
Now let me turn it back to Kelly for an update on the merger and closing thoughts and Q&A.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Darryl. So in terms of the accomplishments – and keep in mind, we really just merged these two
companies in December so we've accomplished a lot – most importantly, we rolled out the Truist culture. We were
able to complete 32 town hall meetings. We had a few at the very end that we had to cancel or defer because of
COVID-19, but we got through most of the enterprise and the reception to it was extremely good. We introduced
and rolled out our Truist visual identity and logo. We did complete the purchase of Truist Center which is our
corporate headquarters here in Charlotte. We launched the Truist Foundation and we were able to go ahead and
begin consolidating some redundant real estate portfolio that we had that we could go ahead and begin to get
some early cost saves.
So in terms of the next steps, if you think about it right now we really have two major priorities. Number one
priority is focusing on COVID-19. We're laser-focused on taking care of our teammates, making sure everybody's
safe and well. We're doing everything we can possibly do to support our clients not only in terms of their safety in
terms of interaction with us but also in terms of helping them sustain the economic challenges that are going
along with this terrible experience we're all going through. We're trying to be very willing to invest and be creative
in terms of how to support our communities and we're doing some really interesting things there in terms of
broadband and those types of things that we could do to help communities that are really, really struggling.
So the second priority for us is keeping the integration and conversion on track. We believe we are in a good
place there. It's hard to know exactly what may happen with regard to any delays. It really depends on the depth
and the lift of the health crisis. But at this point we still feel good about where we are in terms of our planned
conversion and integration activities. In terms of our performance targets, we still believe in the medium-term. We
would project a return on tangible common equity in the low 20s, adjusted efficiency in the low 50s. You can see
we're already pretty much there and we still remain very confident in terms of our $1.6 billion in net cost saves.
Exactly when we achieve that kind of depends on obviously the environment we're living in. If it's a V, then we'll
recover pretty quickly and we'll hit these in a not-too-distant medium target-type of range. If it's a U, it'll take a little

bit longer and that's just pretty obvious. Regardless, we believe that we will be a top-tier performer whatever the
absolute numbers are. I will say to you that all of the benefits of the merger look better now than they did a year
ago.
Finally, if you look at our value proposition slide, we believe we provide a really strong value proposition. We are a
purpose-driven company committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities. That's really important,
more important than ever in today's world. We have an exceptional franchise with diverse product, services and
markets. We have strong market share in vibrant, fast-growing MSAs in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and a growing
national presence. We have a very comprehensive and diverse business mix in banking, capital markets and
insurance. And very importantly, we are simply better together. We're stronger; we're more resilient; we have
best-in-breed in terms of talent, technology, strategy and processes.
We are very uniquely positioned to deliver best-in-class efficiency and returns while investing in the future. That
said, we have net $1.6 billion of net cost saves yet to come. These complimentary businesses are clearly going to
yield substantial revenue increases as we develop the synergies. Our returns and capital are buoyed by purchase
accounting accretion which Daryl has described to you and we're making meaningful investments in technology
capabilities, our teammates, marketing and advertising.
We have a very strong capital and liquidity with resilient risk profile enhanced by the merger. We are very prudent
and disciplined in risk management and financial management. We have a very conservative risk culture, leading
credit metrics among the highest-rated large banks. We have diversification benefits that arise from the merger
we've discussed. We stress test very, very well separately and together. We have a very strong capital and
liquidity position, being enhanced even with the flight to quality. And we have a very defensive and I would call a
strong and resilient balance sheet supported by purchase accounting marks combined with the CECL credit
reserves. Because of the strength of our balance sheet and our liquidity, I would expect us to continue our
dividend as we move forward into as far as we can see. So like I said, in January, if you liked us a year ago you
should love us now and we continue to believe our best days are ahead.
Ryan, I'll turn it back over to you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Saul Martinez of UBS. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys. Wanted to ask a little bit about the outlook for credit and the airplay with the accounting
and a lot of the moving parts there. So on slide 16 you go through your day one, January 1 true-up and the
additional reserve builds in the first quarter. But Darryl, how much of – can you just tell us how much of the $3.5
billion credit mark is – $3.5 billion loan mark, sorry, is for credit versus liquidity and rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Saul. So first, I would tell you when we came up with our day one estimate on our reserve, we had three
scenarios that we came up with and we weighted our stress there 40% on day one, so we started the year off with
a strong reserve from that perspective. When we moved over and made our provision this quarter, we went
through multiple scenarios as we always run. And then with Moody's changing their scenarios every few days, we
actually ended up running 10 different scenarios through quarter end into early April trying to help use an overlay
to help us adjust on that CECL number that we came up with.
And then at the end of the day, you're back to using expert judgment. We always have qualitative factors this year
or this time. Clarke and Ellen and the team really had to spend a lot of time qualitatively because the models have
limitations when the government is infusing over $5 trillion and they have to weigh in on what the effectiveness is.
You have all these payment plans basically out there and you need the expert judgment on how effective those
programs might be, so there's lots of qualitative adjustments that we came up with. We feel very good about the
reserves that we have there.
As far as your fair value mark, we – basically it's a combination of credit, liquidity and interest rate and it's at $3.5
billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Okay. How much of that is credit versus interest rate...?

We didn't disclose that out, Saul.

I mean, at the end of the day – Saul, at the end of the day, I mean, it's all going to accrete into earnings. It's all
going to be used as a lower value for when we – you get a little bit of benefit because you have a lower book

doesn't matter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. But I'm trying to understand the loss absorbing capacity for credit a little bit more. And then just
going forward though, I mean, you did mention that there is a possibility for reserve builds. And if I think about
going forward, if the economic environment does worsen and credit does worsen more than what's sort of
embedded in your outlook, how does that play out? Obviously, on the SunTrust book you'll have to – and on your
BB&T legacy book you'll have to true-up your ACLs. But on the credit mark, do you – if it turns out that whatever
that portion of the $3.5 billion that's for credit marks is insufficient and the losses will be larger than that, how does
that work in terms of the accounting? Do you need to re-estimate that down and then get a subsequent benefit on
purchase accounting accretion? I guess what I'm asking is even going forward, do you get a – is there a risk of
sort of a double hit to your equity base from reserve builds and credit mark adjustments that only come back over
time?

Daryl N. Bible A

So when you come up with your CECL reserves, you really don't take into account the fair value mark. It is a
lower book value so you end up providing less. It really is going to depend on what I said in my prepared remarks.
What happens in the economy? Is it going to be more stressful? Is the government plans how effective they're
going to be and then how deep it really is? Clarke?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Saul, we assumed through a weighted probability of all those scenarios that Daryl described and we did our
estimate, we assumed very sharp initial GDP contraction, a spike in unemployment and then lingering high single-
digit unemployment for the two-year reasonable supportable period, and our mean reversion was basically similar
to what we experienced after the Great Recession. And so then we did, to Daryl's point, a good bit of sensitivity
analysis around the different stress portfolios. We looked at the historical and projected redefault rates on the
different margin deferrals and we baked all of that into our qualitative overlay. So we feel like the estimate today is
the best. We know obviously if things deteriorate worse we would have to provide more; if they – if it holds up as
we've projected then we're well-reserved.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I mean, I understand it on the CECL reserve. But on the unamortized loan mark, if the losses are greater than
$3.5 billion will you recalibrate those estimates? How does that work?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So you have a year to true-up your goodwill but that's based upon a miscalculation you had at the 12/6. But we
feel pretty good. We finalized all the marks. I think I mentioned that the new amortization amount is on the
intangible, so all that was trued-up this quarter. Actually, we have a table on it in the deck, so all that's kind of
finalized from that perspective. We really can't go back and readjust any of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, okay. So there's no – there's not really a risk there that there's an incremental loss associated with that on

Daryl, can you share with us – it looks like your purchase accounting accretion came in stronger this quarter. Your
tangible book value obviously jumped up to $26 a share that is probably attributed to, I guess, stronger purchase
accounting accretion. Can you give us some color on how that worked out this quarter versus maybe prior
expectations?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Yeah. So we came in higher than expected and it was mainly due to loans paying off both on the corporate side
and on the consumer side, so it was a little bit above our own estimate that we had. On a go-forward basis, I
would say that you can't count on that basically overestimating throughout the year; it's possible but you wouldn't
count on it. So if you look at core versus reported margin, we were 52 basis points difference. I would probably
think it averages closer to 40 basis points on a consistent basis, but you never know what's going to happen on a
quarter-to-quarter basis on payoffs. It's just some people will pay off their loans; you have to basically take in all
the accretion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. And then on slide 19 which was very insightful and appreciate you putting that together, can you share with
us – and maybe it's as simple as the economic assumptions are not – are different than the stress test. But why
it's – in CECL accounting it's anyone, you and your peers, are looking at life-of-loan losses. Why aren't the
reserves even higher and where is it the highest relative to the stress losses? Why don't they match with the
stress tests we're testing for? Again, is it as simple as the economic assumptions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So there's a difference between CECL and stress testing. Stress testing is a dynamic, living, breathing
process so you basically have to project new volumes and growth or one-offs depending on whatever happens.
CECL is basically a static balance sheet with one-off assumptions so there's differences there. The chart that
we've put in on 19, just to give credit, we basically plagiarized that from Jason Goldberg; I give Jason a lot of
credit for that. But I think, on that table, it clearly shows that our reserves that we have versus the combined
company losses that we've added together from 2018 is at 35%, so it's a little bit above the peer group, and then
if you add in the fair market value, it's at 58%.
One thing to note though, if you actually look at our company-run results on a combined basis in 2018, that
number was basically 44%. The reason I'm telling you that is that we don't have our 2020 CCAR stress results yet
from the Fed. That will come later this quarter. But we do have what we submitted to the Fed a few weeks ago.
And if you look at what the company-run stress results were on severely adverse we were basically at 52%.
So I think that shows a good indication that, as we put the companies together, Clarke and Ellen have really de-
risked the company, and we just are a less-riskier company than we would've been on a combined 2018 basis. So
our reserves then at 52%, and then if you add in the fair value mark, you're at 84% of our – we came up with
$10.8 billion of losses in our 2020 severely adverse.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the call and the color. Two questions. One, you gave us the number of customers
that have been requesting deferrals. I think it's 330,000 on the consumer side and 15,000 on the wholesale side.
Can you give us a sense as to the percentage of balances that those each represent?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Betsy. This is Clarke. On the consumer side, it's about $9 billion. That's for both owed to us and serviced
for others, so it's about $8 billion for balance sheet, so roughly 3%. On the commercial side, it's about roughly $10
billion or so, 5% or 6%. So, again, I would note the far majority of all of our re-agings have been with accounts
that are current to start with even in our sub-prime auto as an example.
So, again, I think this is a very unusual environment, so you have a lot of people that are worried, that have –
maybe have lost their jobs or maybe have not, but they're worried and – but it's a little different than normal and
that most are current to start with.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And in your forward look on the CECL that we're just talking through, how high do you expect those numbers to
go?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
I mean it really depends on the three factors I said earlier, Betsy. I mean, right now, we feel we are adequately
reserved from what we know. There is a lot more that we don't know than what we know though and how things
are going to impact. I mean, the government is going to have over $6 trillion of stimulus when it's all said and
done. That's three times more than what they had in the Great Recession.
We really don't know how effective those programs are going to be. So you really need to let a lot of that play out.
All the forbearance that's been occurring right now, I mean, that all has to play out. And some of the clients may
not make it, but it is – we feel really comfortable where we are reserved today and we'll just see what happens as
we move forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
And Betsy, keep in mind too that the effects of the Payroll Protection Program will keep people whole in terms of
their income. And those that are furloughed, in most cases, as I understand it, their unemployment insurance
because there was an increase in the normalized unemployment insurance substantially, in many cases, people
have more take-home income than they had before. So it's hard to see exactly today in the short run that there
would be a huge negative impact. Obviously, if this is extended and the government programs don't provide
continued stimulus, then it will be a factor. But, in the short run, the government has actually done a pretty good
job in terms of providing short-term buffer.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Got it. Yeah. Okay. And then just moving to expenses. On the $1.6 billion, I understand it's hard to know the
timeframe given everything that's going on. I'm just wondering how much of that $1.6 billion do you feel you can
control today versus maybe you put aside because it's redundancies that you don't want to touch at this stage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Well, it's – all of it is of a term that is still achievable. You're right though. Some of it may be deferred because of
the environment we're in today because of more people being – working away from the office, connectivity, et
cetera. There may be some things that we're not able to do as quickly as we had anticipated. But our people are
setting this daily. And as of today, they have not discovered any material issues that will dramatically slow down
our progression in terms of integration, and the progression of that integration is what drives the cost saves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
And I'll give you a couple examples. So, on the third party vendor, right now, our teams are still working on it, but
we're probably 35% to 40% of the way of our target. So we'll have about a close to $100 million annual run rate
save this year, and for the next couple years, we have already locked in $135 million of that, so that's progressing
well. We're making really good progress on our corporate real estate portfolio. We have over 30,000 square feet.
Right now, we have known savings in there of about $66 million of what we're executing on. If you look at what
we're going through right now with people working at home, we have to really evaluate the impacts of that after it's
all said and done, but that could be an opportunity for much more saves. So, we have $30 million – we might go
down to $20 million over the next three to five years. I mean, you just don't know that, so that could be even a
bigger opportunity, but those are just a few examples, Betsy.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. A few more questions about your forward guidance. Kelly, I thought you said or maybe Daryl talked about the
potential for positive operating results this year, which seems pretty tough with your second quarter guidance as it
relates to that guidance. On the [ph] site expenses (41:28) in the second quarter, you've mentioned Denver, real
estate, all these other things, and you said that was ex the COVID effect. And then the other part of the guidance,
some other banks have said – expect much higher reserves – reserve building in the second quarter. I know
you've given some numbers on that, but just exactly where you stand. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Mike. So, I would definitely say it's going to be a challenge from linked-quarter from first to second. We will
continue to execute and do the best that we can within the parameters that we have. And we aren't giving up on
our positive operating leverage; we're going to do the best we can. We may not achieve it this year, but we still

may. It is not out of the woods; it all depends on how quickly the economy recovers, and if it's a sharp V, we have
a shot at it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And the other question, the reserve build in the second quarter. I mean, some banks say, hey, look, since the end
of the first quarter, conditions have gotten worse. I guess you use Moody's. I guess and maybe have some
flexibility to use your own capital markets group for forecasts like the larger banks or given the decline since the
end of the first quarter, will you expect more reserve building? Even though you've said you're 84% reserved for
like your 2020 bank-submitted stress test, which is a big number, that's all in with your purchase accounting
marks, if I got that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yes, you're right on that. As far as – we use Moody's and we also have a couple other scenarios that we run, but
we went into early April running scenarios and adjusting our reserve. But we didn't kind of off on the 31. We
closed a little later this quarter just because we were later in the cycle, so we went through at least the first week
of April with that information.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. And again, if the economy actually underperformed those scenarios we would have to provide more. But
based on what we know today we think we're well-reserved but we're certainly watching it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And so how much of the expense savings have you achieved so far? And you said some of the timeframes
might split and you mentioned some areas that you'll still have. But it's – I mean, you have the pandemic with the
biggest merger in your history happening at the same time so it's a tough situation, and it sounds like you're
managing through it. But maybe just to get out on the table now what we should expect as opposed to wait until
later?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So from a specific expense savings, we have some savings. There has been some slippage just with what
happened in March, and that with COVID some of our expenses are a little bit elevated. We pulled forward buying
a bunch of our laptops and MyFis and other equipment that got pulled forward into the first quarter that we were
planning on later in the year, so it was a little bit elevated from that perspective. Our goal was to try to get our
expenses down up to 30% out of $1.6 billion by the end of the year. We are on track so far this quarter to doing
that. We were trying to have some buffer and be ahead of that. It doesn't get any easier as we get into this next
quarter to be honest with you, but we still have a shot at getting our 30% at the end of the year if we have a sharp
recovery.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Regarding the exposures, the at-risk credit exposures on slide 15, the $28.5 billion. I know you indicated on that
slide that you have qualitative overlays for the affected industries. So can you give us a little bit more color on
that, on the magnitude and maybe the amount of loan loss reserve against those portfolios and maybe the loan
mark against them?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So we haven't disclosed that level of detail. I would tell you this, that for each of those segments we have done
detailed analysis, things like risk grade, notching and a good bit of sensitivity to the downside in each and every
one of those. We've looked at modification or deferral request, and so we used that to add additional overlays on
top of what the models would've driven in. They're considerably higher than the other segments, I would just tell
you that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. All right. And then the – in terms of the insurance business, I know you indicated in your second quarter
outlook that you or in your outlook that you do expect COVID to dampen the organic trends in the business. Can
you give us just a little bit more detail on how that could play out? And is there are an offset from perhaps any
better pricing that you see in the industry? Just want to see how you think about how that plays out. Thanks.

3%; that's our seasonally strongest quarter of the year. And you're right, the slowdown as a result of COVID really
is creating declining exposure units. That could be lost people, lost business, what have you, and that will slow

economic – I mean, new business production. But to your point, there would be a potential pick up on pricing.
When we went into the Great Recession, we went in with the backdrop of a soft insurance market. We go into this
one with actually a very strong market on the back of 2017 and 2018 being the two largest insured losses in
history. So we're kind of in the up 4.5%, 5% range right now which if we got to go into one that's a good backdrop
to have at your – you're going to have at your back.
And just for this quarter, for example, rates were up 4.5%. If you throw on top of that lower interest rates, this life –
I mean, these P&C underwriters are going to be struggling on their investment returns so they will likely continue
to keep upward pressure on the rate environment. So I think your intuition is exactly right. We reached that
momentum in pricing for the balance of the year, but we do see softening business production. So what we might
have been looking at this past quarter, we had 7.2% organic growth, kind of looking forward it's looking more like
maybe in the flat to 2% kind of range for the balance of the year.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thank you. Good morning. Daryl, just wondering if we could step back out a step on the revenue side. You talked
about second quarter revenues down a few percent. And just following on a bit of the fee part that was just talked
about, can you help us just understand NII versus fees? There's so many moving parts involved, but if you can
directionally just help us understand the moving parts and direction of fees, that'd be helpful. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Just high level, Ken, I would tell you, and Chris commented on insurance, insurance is seasonally strong
second quarter; that won't change from that perspective. Service charges, we have some programs in place to
help our clients during this time of stress. That's what Kelly talked about, the 5% cashback, we are waiving ATM
fees so people can meet their banking services. People are coming in now. We're getting more requests for relief
on NSF and we're granting that. So I would say the service charges overall might be down a touch from that
perspective. Depending on what interest rates do and credit spreads, those areas, while the volumes are overall
lower there it hits DD&A, the $92 million, that line item has a chance of recovering potentially on what happens
with that. And then mortgage; mortgage will have good volumes, strong. The offset will be the impact on
forbearance on the servicing. We did try to factor in some estimates on the MSR valuation already. We don't know
if that's the full impact of that but it is embedded in there so we did adjust for that accordingly. So mortgage will
probably have a decent quarter would be my guess.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
And on the NII side also, can you just help us understand the balance sheet looks like it's going to keep growing
and you mentioned the difference between stated and core NIM. But can you help us understand just most – a lot
of other peers are talking about NII growing from here. You guys have the purchase accounting as an extra factor
in that. Any way you can help us just parse out the moving parts there too?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I don't foresee our – unless purchase accounting really is stronger than we think, I don't foresee NII being
positive second quarter versus first quarter. Core margin, if you looked at our sensitivities, and you probably need
to go back to our disclosures back in January when we disclosed, what, a down 100 basis points, now our
disclosures that we show on our earnings reports are gradual, so it's assuming that 100 basis points would go
down throughout the 12 months. At that point in January, it was a negative 1.78% – 1.72% if you say that's
equivalent to like a shock of 50 basis points, so what we experienced in March was a shock of 150 basis points.
Now, you had a little bit weird going on with LIBOR, and LIBOR we'll talk about in a second, but we had a shock
of 150 basis points. So if you take the 1.72% and multiply it by 3, that would probably be what the impact would
be, rough estimate on what our NII change might be for second quarter from that perspective.
Then, we have built a lot of liquidity. Now, we built liquidity because we're in a stress period. We want to make
sure we can meet our clients' needs both from a funding and from a deposit perspective. So the costs that we're
carrying, what we're carrying at the Fed right now is anywhere from 10 to 15 basis points. I mean, if you look at
our balance sheet right now and through Friday on April 17, our balance sheet and total balances are $518 billion,
our deposits now are $364 billion. So all the government stimulus checks that started to come in last week, we
had one day, I think it was Wednesday where we went up $6 billion in deposits in that one time period. Our PPP
funding is going to start going on the books. It started last week; it's going to go on this week and the following
week. We'll probably have $330 billion of loans so we're definitely going to have much higher earning assets.
The other thing I would note is that our deposit costs. We were at 70 basis points, down 12 basis points on an
interest-bearing basis. If you look at March, our interest-bearing deposit costs were already 56 basis points. When
you go back and look at the Great Recession and you look at how far the deposit costs get down to back then, we
got down to about 23 basis points. So I don't think we're going to get to 23 basis points in the second quarter but
we're going to get in the 20s for sure over the next couple quarters as we continue to push down rates, if these
rates stay where they are. So I think we got a lot of things that we have to manage with, but core margin will be
down because of liquidity. But once we feel that the stress is over we can reverse the liquidity pressure there
pretty easily and you get that core margin back. So, hopefully that's helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Very much so, Daryl. And you were going to talk about LIBOR and that is a point I was wondering if you could talk
about, how are you seeing LIBOR normalize down as you look out over time? Thanks for all the color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, it peaked on April 1 at 102 basis points. It's now at 67 basis points, one-month LIBOR. We have about
$130 billion net LIBOR assets tied to one-month LIBOR right now. So, as that migrates down, that will kind of put
in that full effect to that interest rate sensitivity that you saw there. We aren't there yet, it still has room to come
down some more. But that will also allow us to push down our deposit costs faster, too, as LIBOR is coming down
as well. And when you look at the money market equivalent, that will all kind of come down together. So, it will
hurt our asset side, but we're going to make it up on the deposit side.

Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
You're welcome.

Operator: We will now take our next question from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Matt O'Connor Q

Good morning.

Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Morning.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So, you guys have addressed the risk that some of the integration gets delayed if we don't get a V-shaped
recovery here. I guess, on the flipside, the risk of losing customers and staff to competitors is probably a lot less
than maybe some people fear, partly because of virus, partly the actions that you're doing for your staff seems
very generous. So, maybe you could just talk, Kelly, Bill about the engagement of your staff and how you keep the
culture kind of both moving in the same direction? You can't do it from the town halls that you were doing before,
but just talk about some of those kind of softer aspects of doing the business and your customer base or
employee base? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Why don't you go ahead, and maybe I'll add a comment at the end.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William H. Rogers, Jr. A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Matt. I think, as you'd point out, I mean, the pension numbers were already good coming in
from a teammate perspective. And we just did a survey that was an engagement proxy, and in this incredible
environment, the survey actually showed high levels of engagement from our teammates. In many ways, the
cultural integration has been accelerated by months, if not years, because people are operating under stressful
conditions. The teamwork has been spectacular. I think, Kelly, you would echo that that no one's wearing a jersey
because they're all headed towards the same objective.
So, I think you've point out accurately there are elements of this that are advantageous as we go through this
process. And I've personally been just really, really proud of the work that our teammates have done. The town
halls and the rollout of purpose, mission, and values, we were well underway there, and that has been a really
good catalyst because everybody's got something to lean forward on, they're all speaking the same language and
operating from the same playbook.

Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
And I will just point out one additional point. I said earlier, the culture matters always. It really matters in a time like
this. And a really big part of our culture is just taking care of our teammates. And we get that our clients come
first, but you can't take care of your clients without doing a really good job for your teammates. And so, Truist is
unique in terms of having a – fully paid for pension plan and of [ph] Truist's own safe (00:56:25) 401(k) match.
And then, we do things like $1,200 bonuses and premium pay for people on the line.
So, all of those things, our teammates really appreciate. And so, they see that during difficult times we're going to
take care of them even if there's some sacrifice in terms of short-term profitability. We're going to take care of our
teammates because they can feel safe and secure, and then they can help our clients feel safe and secure.
Those memories will be here for decades. And so, we feel very good about our culture. As Bill said, it is
accelerated and it is strong as steel.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And then just a question for Daryl. You talked about, for new loans, implementing some floors.
Could you just talk about the rates, how much above the floors that you are and I assume, as loans come up for
renewal, you'll attempt to do the same thing on those loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, David reported, I think, a week or two ago that the floors that he's putting in range anywhere from, I
think, 25 to 75 basis points from a LIBOR perspective, I think those are the floors that he's putting in from that
perspective. That's the LIBOR rate not the spread over.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.

Operator: And we will take our next question from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Good morning. I just had one follow-up question. Of this $480 million in annualized cost save that you noted,
how much of that is achievable without interruption to pandemic-related support of your employees and your
clients? And if I'm interpreting, Daryl, your answer to Betsy's question, $100 million of annual run rate savings
from third-party vendors, $66 million from known savings in corporate real estate. So, it sounds like at least $166
million of that for $480 million would have nothing to do with supporting your employees or clients?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, Erika, just one comment, and Daryl can add. You're right. You can count, I think, in terms of expenses being
bifurcated. There are expenses that are independent of COVID like real estate. Some of our vendor contracts are
independent of COVID. And we've seen substantial reductions in our run rate vendor contracts already, and more
to come.
With regard to the teammates, there's a one-time big charge we had with regard to the $1,200 bonus. But the
ongoing from this point forward, teammate charges are not – are marginally incremental. And in terms of the
impact on the conversion, it really depends, but today our people are functioning very well working off-site. And
then, keep in mind, we, in the technology area, we've already – we've got thousands of people working off-site
forever. So, this is not a new idea; it's just more people doing it.
And so, as long as they're able to continue to do their scoping and their mapping and their programming remotely,
which now we see that they can, it's now self-evident that there will be a dramatic change with regard to our
integration and conversion scheduling.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. For the second quarter, Erika, we are paying a premium to our teammates right now that are on the
frontlines. You see [ph] that we've got an (00:59:54) elevated charge in personnel with that. Depending on how
quickly we basically can adjust from work at home that will fade away. We also are actively getting more laptops
sent to more people on the call centers can do more of their work at home, so that will subside as we get more of
that equipment in as well that we've accelerated from that perspective.
As far as like the implementation of third-party and facilities, as they execute and play out, that's when you get the
savings. So, you may not see as much early on this year. But, as it goes out throughout the year and as we
continue to move, it will start to build. That said the fourth quarter will have a higher annualized impact than what
you would see at this point from that perspective; so a lot of good things.
Although some of the third-party savings is tied to conversions; I mean, just to be transparent, there is some big
card conversions coming up, some big conversions coming up in the wealth and broker-dealer areas. So, I think
right now, in Joe's world, he's planning to – he'll stay on track with an earlier conversion. And in broker-dealer, I
think that's going to be in the first part of 2021. If that stays on track that might miss a little bit at the end of 2020,
but he wasn't supposed to be there at the end of 2020. He's scheduled more for early 2021. But if that plays out
then some of those savings will come in at that point in time.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks. First, I want to say thank you guys for the way you all are leading in
community impact. Being in one of your affected communities, I'd say the leadership has appreciated in
importance, so thank you guys for that. I wanted to ask you, as it pertains to your capital and how you've talked
about longer-term when you get back to 10% to resume buyback. And [ph] I would just assume (01:01:47) in this
environment, probably that far ways out. But I'm just curious how are you thinking about that number, the 9.3%
CET1 versus kind of the, I think it was 8.7% if you imposed [indiscernible] (01:01:58) and the CECL impact and
kind of how that pertains to that 10% target and where you think about buybacks way down the line?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, nobody's thinking about buybacks today. We are in a very strong capital position and are still bringing capital.
I mean, we still made [indiscernible] (01:02:20) even before adjustments this year this quarter. So, we will be
steadily moving up unless there are dramatic increases in loan losses, which we would not project at this time.
Again, if it's a long view, that makes a difference, we all understand that. So, we have said that our intermediate
term target was 10%. We've said we did that because of the uncertainty that we knew about with regard to the
merger. We've said we were doing that because of uncertainties we didn't know about. We didn't know about
COVID of course. But thank goodness we did prepare for that, and we're in a really good position.
Now, as those uncertainties subside, in terms of the merger integration and, surely, the health crisis will go away
and surely the economy will improve, then we have said and I would reaffirm, we have capital opportunities as we
go forward below that 10% level. It will depend on the then existing circumstances, but there are opportunities
available for our shareholders.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
And the other minor point is, remember, that PPP loans we're putting on the books have a 0% risk weight. So, we
put $10 billion on from the first round, that's not going to cost us any risk-weighted capital. And then, from a
leverage number, even though we're going to fund it ourselves, it's not going to really cost us because we're
basically just trading out at 10 basis points balance at the Fed to 100 basis point earning asset from PPP. So,
from a capital perspective, those should be fine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thanks. Helpful. And then one other thing; I'm curious we've seen some others in the industry kind of tighten
underwriting standards around resi mortgage, [ph] fee loss (01:04:00), other categories. Have you guys – I mean,
you've always been fairly conservative on lending, but have you further tightened any of your underwriting
standards? And kind of within that, what are you seeing with the forbearance request in terms of industry
concentration? Thanks again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Steve, this is Clarke. I would say yes to that question. Across all our asset classes, we've done pretty extensive
reviews, and we have made underwriting and risk acceptance changes as appropriate as you would expect us to
do. So, I think we would be more on the conservative end, and they are in place today.

We've also worked hard to be very careful about what we call any non-essential lending right now given the
uncertainty. So, as far as the modification requests, I'd say from the commercial side, we've had a lot in the
stressed industries that we've laid out, things like hospitality, et cetera. And then, on the consumer side, it's been
predominantly on the mortgage and the auto side right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
And you'll recall, so we have made some adjustments with regard to underwriting standards even pre-COVID.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A

So, we had already been anticipating a potential slowdown. We've made adjustments already.

Operator: We will take our next question from Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Daryl, is there an average life on the PPP loans that we should expect?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Sure, Chris. We don't really have a good estimate on how much forgiveness is going to be out there. If I gave you
a number, it would be a pure guess right now. So, I don't really know whether it goes out. My guess is we're –
everybody's making their loans now, so you get a big tsunami.
Remember, the SBA has to process all these forgivenesses in 60 days. They probably are going to take some
time to process all that. So, my guess is that might linger on into three, four, five months before all the
forgivenesses are happened, and we'll see how quickly they do that. But then, there will be some and portions of
some loans that will stay the full two years.
We will accrete the earnings. Then, we'll book them at a discount. The last time I looked at our average discount,
that looked like on the books – it's about 2.7% discount, and that will accrete in. And then, when it pays off for
forgiveness, we'll take all that in at that point in time. If it plays out to two years, then you just earn it over that time
period.

line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hey, guys. Two quick follow-ups. I'm wondering if you could give any color on how the reserve is allocated
between consumer and commercial buckets as of today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, John. I would just say – and one noteworthy thing for the increase for Q1, about 70% of that reserve, that
provision increase was related to commercial; and about 30% was consumer. [indiscernible] (01:07:01) can see
on the split between – I guess, we can get back to you on that, John...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
...on that split in the actual allowance of sales. We can get you that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And then, just kind of wondering, this comes up with questions frequently. Is there a dumbed down
example you guys could give us of how the marks absorb credit and how that helps? Is it just the idea that, if you
have a write-off on a marked loan, you're marking it down from a smaller amount? If it's $100 loan and you're
writing it down from $95 as opposed to $100, so it's a smaller charge-off? That's kind of the question. Like, how
does that mechanic work of help getting – absorb losses, the marks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's exactly right. So, that – basically, your book value is lower, so you apply your reserve against a
lower balance, so it helps you have a little bit. But then, I think of it as it's earnings that are coming in, those
earnings can be used to provide for other provisions or could fall at the bottom line from an earnings perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Meaning the PAA?

Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
You got it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. John, back to the first – your first question. The wholesale reserves for Q1 are about $2.270 billion, and the
consumer's $2.941 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And Daryl, when you think about it, the loss absorbancy, it comes in the form of PAA, so you've got an
extra cushion, that's how you kind of think of it absorbing losses, as giving – you have more cushion on the PAA
side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, well, we definitely have more absorption, more cushion from that perspective. But also, I think, when you
just got the bank coming together and the diversification of how we came together. I mean, we really don't have
any really significant exposure to any of our portfolios because, as we came together, we're much more
diversified. And that should play out when the new stress tests come out from the Fed later this quarter. Our hope
is that we're going to have a really strong PPNR, a really strong loss number, and a very resilient capital ratio. We
should, hopefully, be well under the 250 basis point stress capital buffer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
And remember that, in all of our portfolios, essentially the exposure was reduced in half because of the doubling
of the denominator. So, it is an automatic diversification of this material in this kind of environment.
