Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder,
this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Chris
Gorman. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Thank you for joining us for KeyCorp's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today
are Clark Khayat, our Chief Financial Officer, and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer. On slide 2, you'll find our
statement on forward-looking disclosure and certain financial measures, including non-GAAP measures. These
statements cover our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our
call.
I am now moving to slide 3. This morning, we reported earnings of $266 million or $0.29 per share. Our results
reflect broad-based growth across our franchise, supported by our strong balance sheet and disciplined risk
management. We continue to benefit from our focus on relationship banking and primacy, namely, having our
clients' primary operating account. We continue to add a deepen relationships in both our Consumer and
Commercial businesses, as well as improve both the quality and diversity of our deposits.
Average deposits increased relative to the prior quarter and the year-ago period. Our focus on relationship
continues to guide our balance sheet optimization efforts. This quarter, we reduced average loans by over $3
billion as we de-emphasize credit-only and other non-relationship business. Importantly, our Common Equity Tier
1 ratio increased by 50 basis points to 9.8% as a result of our proactive balance sheet management.
Risk-weighted assets decreased by $7 billion in the third quarter and $9 billion from the beginning of the year,
which is approaching our 2023 full year target of $10 billion. The increase in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio this
quarter moves us above our current targeted capital range of 9% to 9.5%, where we would expect to remain for
the foreseeable future. Other capital ratios were relatively stable this quarter, including our tangible common
equity ratio, which was down 10 basis points despite the impact of higher interest rates.
Overall, our capital remains strong and we are well-positioned relative to our capital priorities and the phase-in of
the proposed future capital requirements. Although we would not expect the same magnitude of change in risk-
weighted assets next year, we will continue to take steps to manage our balance sheet in conjunction with
anticipated regulatory changes.
Net interest income in the quarter reflected the continued high interest rate environment and our balance sheet
positioning. Clark will discuss our balance sheet in his remarks, but I would point out that Key has a very well-
defined net interest income opportunity over the next five quarters as our short-term swaps and treasuries reprice.
In our slide deck, we show net interest income benefit will reach approximately $1 billion on an annualized basis
by the first quarter of 2025. Our net interest margin has been a challenge for us this year. We believe, however,
the third quarter represented the low point for the cycle.
Our results continue to benefit from our strong fee-based businesses, which consistently make up 40% of our
revenue. This revenue mix will be a clear competitive advantage under the proposed regulatory framework. This

quarter, fee income was up 6%, driven by a 17% linked quarter increase in investment banking and debt
placement fees. We expect investment banking fees to increase again in the fourth quarter based on current
pipelines. The absolute level of improvement is, of course, market dependent.
Given the significance of our integrated corporate and investment bank, any normalization in the capital markets
represents an upside opportunity for Key, from both a fee generation and balance sheet management
perspective. In addition to capital markets, our fee income will continue to benefit from our strong positions in both
payments, an area where we have consistently invested, and wealth, where we benefit from critical mass with
assets under management of $53 billion.
Expense management remains a priority. Our results reflect the successful completion earlier this year of a
company-wide effort to improve productivity and efficiency. We are continuing our efficiency journey by further
simplifying and streamlining our businesses. As we narrow our focus, we will continue to drive additional expense
savings, which provide the funding to continue to invest in our business.
Finally, I want to comment on credit quality, which I believe is the most important determinant of return on tangible
common equity and shareholder value over time. Credit quality remains a clear strength of Key. Our credit
measures reflect the derisking we have done over the past decade and our distinctive underwrite distribute model.
This quarter, our net charge-offs were 24 basis points. Over the next several quarters, we expect to continue to
operate below our targeted through-the-cycle range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points.
The quality of our loan portfolio continues to serve us well, with over half of our C&I loans rated as investment-
grade or the equivalent. Similarly, our consumer clients had a weighted average FICO score of approximately 770
at origination. As a reminder, we have limited exposure to leverage lending, office loans, and other high-risk
categories. B and C class office exposure in central business districts totaled $116 million. Two-thirds of our
commercial real estate exposure is in multifamily, including affordable housing, which continues to be a significant
unmet need in this country.
I will close by underscoring my confidence in the long-term outlook for Key. Our businesses are well-positioned
and we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. Credit quality remains one of our most significant strengths. We
will continue to focus on maintaining the quality of our loan book and enhancing our risk management framework.
This positions us well to deliver sound, profitable growth and create value for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Clark to provide more details on our results for the quarter. Clark?

Thanks, Chris. I'm now on slide 5. The third quarter net income from continuing operations was $0.29 per
common share, up $0.02 from the prior quarter and down $0.26 from last year. Our results were generally
consistent with the guidance we provided for the quarter and we've affirmed the full-year outlook we shared at our
last earnings call.
As Chris highlighted in his remarks, our results reflect the strength of our core business, focus on primacy,
balance sheet optimization and our disciplined risk management. I'll cover each of these strategic focus areas in
my remarks this morning.
Turning to slide 6. Average loans for the quarter were $117.6 billion, up 3% from the year-ago period and down
3% from the prior quarter. Total loans ended the period at $115.5 billion, down $3.5 billion from the prior quarter.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
The decline in average loans was driven primarily by a reduction in C&I balances, which were down almost 4%
from the prior quarter. The reduction reflects our balance sheet optimization, which prioritizes full relationships
and de-emphasizes credit-only and non-relationship business as we prepare the balance sheet for a Basel III
Endgame world.
The reduction in loans contributed to the decline in risk-weighted assets representing roughly half of the RWA
decline this quarter. RWAs were also impacted by our optimization efforts, to which we were able to apply more
attractive capital treatment to existing portfolios. Importantly this allowed us to manage RWAs proactively while
minimizing impact to net interest income.
Turning to slide 7. Key's longstanding commitment to primacy continues to support a stable, diverse base of core
deposits for funding. This quarter, average deposits totaled $144.8 billion, relatively stable from the year-ago
period, and up nearly $2 billion from the prior quarter. The increase in average deposit balances from the prior
quarter was driven by an increase in both consumer and commercial deposit balances.
Importantly, we have continued to improve the quality of our funding mix by growing core relationship balances,
and reducing wholesale and broker deposits. This quarter, broker deposits declined by $2.6 billion on average
and $3.2 billion relative to period-end balances. At the end of the quarter, we took advantage of our improved
funding profile and called $1.2 billion of outstanding bank debt for redemption. We expect to redeem the debt at
the end of October.
Our total cost of deposits was 188 basis points in the third quarter, and our cumulative deposit beta, which
includes all interest-bearing deposits, was 46% since the Fed began raising interest rates in March 2022. Higher
interest rates resulted in the continued deposit mix shift this quarter. We've seen this mix shift slow and we are
testing reduced rates in certain markets. We did not deploy higher rates in our retail business against this July
interest rate hike. We continue to expect that our cumulative deposit beta will approach 50% by the end of the
year.
Turning to slide 8. Taxable net interest income was $923 million for the third quarter, down 23% from the year-ago
period and down 6% from the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.01% for the third quarter, compared to
2.74% for the same period last year, and 2.12% for the prior quarter. Year-over-year net interest income and the
net interest margin were impacted by higher interest-bearing deposit costs and a shift in funding mix to higher
cost deposits and borrowings.
Relative to the second quarter, the decline in net interest income reflects a planned reduction in earning asset
balances from our balance sheet optimization efforts and higher interest-bearing deposit costs. Our net interest
margin and net interest income continue to reflect the headwind from our short-dated treasuries and swaps. Our
swap portfolio and short-dated treasuries reduced net interest income by $370 million and lowered our net interest
margin by 80 basis points this quarter.
We believe that NIM bottomed in the third quarter as we see continued benefit from the maturity of swaps and
treasuries. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect that we are at or near the bottom on NII. In the
third quarter, we executed $6.7 billion of spot pay fixed swaps. In October, subsequent to the quarter-end, we
terminated $7.5 billion of receive fixed cash flow swaps, which were scheduled to mature throughout 2024.
The swap termination locked in the AOCI position of those swaps, which will amortize throughout 2024 on the
original maturity schedule. This should have no impact to our AOCI position at the end of 2024, but will guard
against future hikes or a reduction in rates that is slower than the forward curve predicts. These actions along with

the planned maturity of our short-term treasuries make Key less liability sensitive, protect capital, and reduce our
exposure to higher rates.
Turning to slide 9. As Chris mentioned earlier, our balance sheet positioning, which has been a near-term drag on
earnings, represents a clear and well-defined opportunity. Based on the forward curve, which continues to adjust
to higher levels, we project an annualized net interest income benefit of approximately $1 billion from the
maturities of our short-term treasuries and swaps by the first quarter of 2025. We'll continue to take a measured,
but opportunistic approach to lock in this benefit.
Moving to slide 10. Noninterest income was $643 million for the third quarter of 2023, down $40 million from the
year-ago period, and up $34 million from the second quarter. The decrease in noninterest income from the year-
ago period reflects a $23 million decline in corporate services income due to lower customer derivatives trading
revenue.
Additionally, service charges on deposit accounts declined $23 million, driven by the previously announced and
implemented changes in our NSF/OD fee structure and lower account analysis fees related to interest rates. The
increase in noninterest income from the second quarter reflects a $21 million increase in investment banking and
debt placement fees, and an $18 million increase in other income from higher trading income and a gain on loan
sale.
I'm now on slide 11. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.1 billion, up $4 million from the year-ago
period, and up $34 million from last quarter. Compared to the year-ago quarter, computer processing expense
increased $12 million driven by technology investments, and personnel expense increased $8 million driven by
higher salaries and employee benefits partially offset by lower incentive and stock-based compensation. The
increase in expenses relative to the prior quarter was driven by personnel expense, which increased $41 million
from incentive and stock-based compensation, a majority of which was from production-related expenses and a
higher stock price at the end of the quarter.
As we continue to proactively manage our expense base, and simplify and streamline our businesses, this will
improve the client experience, reduce complexity in cost, and provide flexibility to continue to invest for the future.
Our goal as expressed previously is to again keep core expenses flat in 2024. We expect to have additional
efficiency-related expenses in the fourth quarter connected with these efforts. While not complete, we would
estimate those charges to be in the range of $50 million. We'll provide full 2024 guidance during our fourth quarter
earnings call.
Moving now to slide 12. Overall credit quality and our related outlook remained strong. For the third quarter net
charge-offs were $71 million or 24 basis points of average loans. While nonperforming loans, and criticized loans
continue to move up from their historical lows, we believe Key is well-positioned in terms of credit migration and
potential loss content. Our provision for credit losses was $81 million for the third quarter and our allowance for
credit losses to period end loans increased from 1.49% to 1.54%.
Turning to slide 13. We ended the third quarter with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.8%, up 50 basis points
from the prior quarter and well above our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. Going forward, we expect to stay above
our current targeted range. We'll determine and share any changes to that targeted range once the new capital
rules are finalized. We will remain focused on building capital in advance of newly proposed capital rules and
continue to support client activity and the return of capital. We do not expect to engage in material share
repurchase in the near-term. The right side of this slide shows Key's expected reduction in our AOCI mark. The

AOCI mark is expected to decline by approximately 27% by the end of 2024 and 39% by the end of 2025, which
will provide approximately $2.5 billion of capital built through that timeframe.
During the third quarter, the AOCI position decreased by $500 million in structural burn down. The increase in
rates, specifically in the five-year timeframe, increased the position by approximately $1.1 billion, which resulted in
the net change of $600 million. Importantly, only 10% of our projected $2.5 billion of AOCI reduction between now
and 2025 is driven by the benefit of lower rates represented in the current forward curve.
Said differently, more than 90% of this reduction will occur, even if rates remain flat to current levels, driven by
maturities, cash flows, and time. Given the proposed capital rules, we believe our reduction in AOCI marks, along
with our future earnings and balance sheet management would allow us to organically accrete capital to the
required levels.
Slide 14 provides an outlook for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, as well as the full year compared to
the prior year. Our guidance uses the forward curve as of September 30, which holds Fed funds flat at 5.5%
through August of 2024, ending 2024 at 5%. Balance sheet trends are tracking as anticipated. We expect average
loans to be down 1% to 3% in the fourth quarter versus the prior quarter as we continue to optimize our balance
sheet and recycle capital to support relationship clients.
We expect average deposits to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter. Our outlook assumes a cumulative
deposit beta approaching 50% by year-end. We also expect to continue to improve our funding mix and liquidity.
On a linked quarter basis, net interest income is expected to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter, changed
from our previous guidance of flat to down 2%. Our guidance for noninterest income has changed to up 1% to
3%, reflecting stronger fee income in the third quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Our full year outlook for
fees remains unchanged.
Noninterest expense is expected to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter excluding the potential FDIC
special assessment charge, additional efficiency-related expenses, and an expected pension settlement charge of
$15 million to $20 million. We expect credit quality to remain solid and net charge-offs to average loans to be in
the range of 25 basis points to 35 basis points in the fourth quarter below our expected over-the-cycle targeted
range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points.
Our guidance for fourth quarter GAAP tax rate is 18% to 19%. Once again, our full year outlook for 2023 versus
the prior year has not changed. We feel confident in the foundation of our business and in our strategic efforts to
strengthen capital and liquidity, manage risk and improve earnings.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler.
Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Hi, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
So, great news that we've kind of hit the low on the margin and are at or near the bottom on NII. I guess I'm
curious does that outlook contemplate any further risk-weighted asset reductions that might be outside the scope
of the $10 billion you've articulated for this year? And I guess along those lines, do you think – need to do
anything beyond what you'll do this year? I mean, it looks like you're kind of ramping up the capital base more
quickly. So, how are we thinking about overall balance sheet size within the scheme of bottoming NII trajectory?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, thanks, Scott. Our prop bet was that your first question would be expenses, but this is [indiscernible]
(00:19:47). So, the way I would think about it is, we've got it, the loan balance is down $1 billion to $3 billion in the
fourth quarter, I think that's going to be the vast majority of any reduction in the balance sheet, we could still see
cash come down a bit. And we are still doing some optimization efforts, they won't carry the same size that we
would have seen in this quarter. So you'll see a leveling off of that and that $10 billion, I think is the right number
to be focused on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. That's good and thank you. I did have an expense question. I think you largely hit it in there. So, I'll
refrain from asking about that one. I guess maybe a broader question, though, Clark, I think you've talked about a
3% margin in a normal environment. I think that's still well above what would be implied by the extra billion or so,
benefit through next year. So, maybe just sort of top level, what else would happen – have to happen to get you
there? How are we sort of thinking about that 3% normalized margin?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, to be clear, I think 3-ish area is, again, not out of the realm, I think, to your point, Scott, you adjust it
today, the 80 basis points that we talked about on drag, you'd be at 2.81%, would have been 2.85% last quarter,
kind of 3.19% before that. So, I think it's going to be kind of continued asset mix over time and funding mix. And
what you're seeing, if I just point to the third quarter, you saw kind of flattish deposits and that included a

significant reduction in brokered. So, more client deposits, but the other piece that I think is really important is that
we did and we will continue to focus on reducing our reliance on wholesale funding. So you would have seen that
come down on the order of like $4 billion in the quarter and obviously that has more expense over time.
Now, your next question is probably, once we get into long-term debt rules and we're issuing more wholesale
debt, how does that impact that? I think that, we've sized that a little bit. We will factor that in, but again, I think
when you start to put all these pieces together in a more normalized environment, something in the high 2s to 3s
is not out of the realm of possibility.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Good morning, Erika.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I guess, my question was on the RWA mitigation, so I just – I'm going to follow up on in terms of Clark's answer to
that question. So, you're pointing us to the $10 billion as the right area, which is a lot. It's a lot of RWA to take out.
And I guess I'm wondering, number one, could you give us a sense of how much has already been taken out and
what's to come? And second as we think about the net interest income trajectory for next year, does the comment
of the NII bottoming about here or in the fourth quarter consider the cost of the RWA mitigation that you have left?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, the answer to the first part of your question, Erika is we're currently through the third quarter, we've
reduced $9 billion. So in the third quarter, we reduced $7 billion, on a cumulative basis for the year, we reduced
$9 billion of RWAs. We are well on target to hit our $10 billion. As you try to kind of pivot from RWAs to the impact
on NII, interestingly there is a certain universe of those RWAs that we were able to get just different treatment on,
namely the treatment that we qualified for in any event.
Secondly, there was a lot of unused line fees in there that obviously those two categories don't have any impact
on NII. As you look forward, the other reduction in RWAs would have a marginal impact on NII, but a positive
impact certainly on our returns, certainly on our margins. The other thing that taking out all these RWAs enables

us to do is to focus on right-sizing our expense base as we take out these RWAs. So that's kind of how I think
about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And Chris, I guess, just the follow up to there is Basel III Endgame clearly gives the banks time. And as you
mentioned, the moves that you're making in terms of improving the margin being mindful of balance sheet size,
being mindful of the expense base, that the target would be to improve CET1 generation from here. I guess, how
do you balance the notion of, okay, we have this $10 billion of RWA reduction check that's done and potentially
we're ready to be a little bit more aggressive in the market or not.
You tell me, one of your peers said that they're ready for a loan growth next year versus the notion of, with US
Bank being freed from its Category 2 commitments, whenever everyone runs the data on adjusted CET1, Key
sort of ends up at the bottom of the list. So how do you balance in terms of running the bank day-to-day, right,
versus how your investors are thinking about KeyCorp in sort of this new world order for regulation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. Well, first of all, as you know, the rules are still preliminary, and they're probably likely to change. That said
we're certainly confident that under the proposed current rules, including the definitions and the associated
timeframes, Erika, that we can hit them. And so, what we need to do, what I wanted to do is sort of when the
events of March happened and then these rules came out in July, I wanted us to hit the reset button and reset our
business and make the difficult decisions, so we can get back to growing our business.
As I've always said, the underlying business is in good shape. We're adding clients on the consumer side. We're
adding clients on the commercial side. And what I want to do is right-size our balance sheet, get our loan to
deposit where it needs to be, get our wholesale funding mix where it needs to be, and then free up our people to
get back out in the marketplace and do what they do and that's grow our business. So, that is the needle that
we're currently threading.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
You guys have mentioned that capital markets should be up in the fourth quarter, but I was just wondering, just
between higher rates and the geopolitical risk, just how are you thinking about the outlook for capital markets over
the medium term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Look, the medium term, I feel really good about it, Peter. Over the near term, which I would consider the fourth
quarter, both of the things you mentioned are a challenge. We will be up on a linked-quarter basis, as I look at our
backlog. But the absolute – as I mentioned in my comments, the absolute level of the increase remains to be
seen. Obviously, the geopolitical issues are an issue. The other thing, you think about over the last five or six
trading days where the bond market has been, that obviously has an impact as well.
So, in the near term, I think there's probably additional headwinds, but over the medium term, I think I feel good
about the business. Private equity firms are starting to transact, which is important. If you look at the amount of
M&A that was completed this year in the $100 million to $1 billion area, it's down about 50%, and over time,
obviously, that comes back. So, in the near term, I think we'll be up. I don't know to what degree. In the
intermediate term as in – as you look at 2024, when there's clarity on where these rates settle in and some of
these geopolitical concerns, I think there's going to be a lot of activity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. And then, Chris, if I could ask about the dividend. I mean, you have 70% plus payout ratio. Can you just
talk about your commitment to maintaining that dividend? And is there any risk that you could be forced to cut the
dividend?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
So, I'd be happy to address that. Let me start by just saying my views on our dividend are unchanged. As we've
managed this business, we manage the business for the long-term. Similarly, our board takes the same approach
on everything, including the dividend. And so, when we gather in November, we'll review the dividend, as we
always do, in the context of a range of scenarios. You were just talking about geopolitical scenarios, et cetera, the
macro conditions. But importantly, we're going to take into consideration, as we always do, the normalized
earnings power of our company. And our capital priorities are unchanged. We want to support our relationships,
as our clients and prospects, and secondly the dividend.
The other factors that I think are really important, first and foremost, is credit quality because there's nothing that
denigrates capital more than credit losses. I feel really good about our credit quality. We'll also obviously be
looking at the burn down of AOCI, that obviously is tied in. And then, our ability to organically build capital. We've
already talked about that a little bit through our reduction of RWAs and other actions we took. We're able to grow
our capital per CET1 by 50 basis points this quarter. So, that's kind of how I think about it, but kind of I'll end
where I started that my views on the dividend haven't changed.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Clark, I was wondering if you could kind of walk through some of the hedging strategy
changes – slide 22, a lot of new executions and terminations this quarter. I guess, to start, just can you help us
understand like the net impact of these new moves in terms of like does that help or hurt fourth quarter NII, just to
kind of put it into perspective?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, just to be clear, in the – on that page, Ken, you'll see an incremental $6.7 billion of paid fixed swaps,
those were put on to provide some AOCI protection to higher rates, and then the termination of the $7.5 billion of
2024 pay fix swaps that we've been obviously talking about now for a couple of quarters, also done really to guard
against higher rates. There were the prospect of higher rates or, as we said, kind of rates that remain higher than
the forward curve, which is relatively flat now through 2024, but has some cuts in the back-end. So, anything
that's sort of there or higher will get some protection from both of those positions. I would think about it in terms of
reducing our kind of NII at risk to higher rates, kind of by half to a staged 200-basis-point rise. So, kind of an
extreme scenario, but we're kind of reducing that liability sensitivity there just to protect both capital and earnings.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. So, I guess I'm just trying to figure out with all of that, your outlook for stable NII over third, we've got the
RWA reductions kind of working against that. And then, we have the slide you gave us on maturities. Are these
new adds also incremental in the fourth to your – and helping your fourth quarter forecast?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
So, if I think about the NII fourth versus third, Ken, the swaps and treasuries maturing, which we've talked about,
and think about like if rates don't change, the swap terminations won't have a huge impact versus what we've
already shared. It's really a kind of protection against rates going up. The payers will add a little bit of NII because
we're picking up a little bit of incremental positive carry there. And then you'll see the benefit of a pull through in
the quarter of lower wholesale borrowings.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Okay. All right, perfect, thanks. And...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
And all of that incorporates, I think this was – sorry, implicit or maybe explicit in your question. It all incorporates
the RWA reduction and the loan reductions specifically that we talked about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Understood, thanks. And the last just one is just, so we're going to get that treasury book runoff. Any updated
thoughts in terms of what you do with the rest of the securities portfolio, will that continue to just cash flow down
as well over time?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So we're seeing about anywhere, just call it roughly a $1 billion of cash flow per quarter coming out of that
book. We've used some of that sort of through the course of this year as cash and just short-term liquidity. Just
given some of the things that have happened, you'll see us start to deploy that back into the portfolio in a variety
of different ways, but really focused on bringing the duration of that overall portfolio down.

Hey, Gerard.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Chris, you were very emphatic about the strength of the credit book for KeyCorp, which is great. Can you guys
share with us the second derivative risk? And what I mean by that is maybe some of the non-depository
competitors or even depository competitors in your footprint, or franchise may be taking undue risk and you may
have a customer that borrows from them as well. That could then impact your credit quality. Do you know if the
competitors are being more rational than in prior cycles, which would obviously have impact on everybody not just
KeyCorp?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Well, thanks for your question. Unfortunately I think because there is excess capacity in the loan market in
general, I don't think you're seeing the kind of increase in spreads that you would expect to see at this point in the
cycle in the private loan market, and I don't think you're seeing frankly, some of the changes that you would
expect to see broadly in terms of structure. So I think, and as you know I've said many, many times, on a risk

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
adjusted basis, a properly graded standalone credit rarely returns its cost of capital. So if I'm right about that by
definition a lot of that stuff in my opinion is underpriced.
Now, the other thing that we are seeing obviously, and we have great visibility in is our third-party commercial
loan servicing business, where we have over 640-some-odd-billion that we service, but we have over $200 billion
that is special servicing. So that's where we're servicing basically, where the workout agent for very complex
deals that we're not a part of and that business has already set a record for the year at this point in the cycle, so
that gives you a little bit of an insight into what's going on out there. Clark, would you add anything to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, just maybe a couple of things. One, Gerard, I think among banks, and it'd be consistent with all the
comments we've made about managing relationships. You'll see all of us kind of defending our best relationships
on the credit side, but it's with additional business that comes with that to make those relationships hurdle to
Chris's point about standalone credit.
So, again, I think that banks are being rational broadly, but defending their best relationships as you would
expect. If you think about the third-party non-bank credit market, I would just – I'd make maybe a retrospective
comment, and a prospective comment. Looking backward, I think there's been a lot of credit that's gone outside
the bank market. The question I think which is sort of embedded in yours is do some of those kind of call it just for
the sake of argument, non-bank or fintech originated loans sit on bank balance sheets? That would be a question
we should be asking broadly. We do not at Key have much if any of that business.
The second piece would be around the prospective, which is some of the capital rules are obviously making the
private credit funds engage in conversations about flow agreements and taking credit over time. That is yet to be
written, but clearly there's a lot of conversation and activity there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Thank you for those insights. And then, as a follow-up question, Clark, on the hedging strategy, you've
given us a lot of detail and we all acknowledge forecasting interest rates is very difficult. In fact I find it very
interesting, if you go back to the Federal Reserve's June 21 dots forecast for the Fed funds rate at the end of
2023, they were forecasting a 0.625 Fed funds rate. They missed it by 500 basis points.
So my question for you guys, the long tail risk, what is that in – for next year? Everybody sees you've been very
clear about the benefits by the net interest income on an annualized basis, first quarter 2025 everybody sees that.
What could go wrong or what's that long tail risk that we need to just keep our eyes on or you guys are keeping
your eyes on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah it's probably a couple of versions, but if you think right now kind of – we are asymmetrically at risk to higher
rates. And so we are very contemplative of what happens when rates go up, because as the treasuries and
swaps mature, it's still – there is still a time component, right, so you feel the cost immediately and the yield sort of
pull through. We are contemplating things like a stagflation scenario, right, where it's – the macro economy is a
little softer and you have higher rates. I think often we assume weaker economy rates come down, there are

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
obviously scenarios where that's not the case. So, we're just trying to think through all the implications of that and
the levers and sensitivities that we have to address that.
I think the other piece over time, and we've talked – we used to talk more about this before 2023, which was rates
come down quickly as these things are repricing and can we ensure that we're getting, the right repricing
characteristics when the treasuries and swaps mature. We've talked to that around the hedging we've done for
2023 and obviously we have other significant advantages right now if rates were to come down rapidly. So, we're
thinking about that broad range of conditions, Gerard, and we're trying to project our best view of it, but we're
certainly making sure, we're prepared for different trajectories.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And Clark, on the comment about rates coming down more rapidly, which is a good way, I mean, I am glad you
guys are thinking about that, though it doesn't seem likely but if it did happen, would your funding costs your
deposit rate and you think would they fall as quickly as what would happen on the asset side of the balance sheet
from your guys experience or would they lag?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
So, the nice thing on the way down from the commercial deposit book, which I know, you know, Gerard, but it's
sort of $55-ish billion was $33 billion pre-pandemic. So, it's pretty meaningful for us a lot of that's indexed. So, it'll
move when rates move. Now, they're not all indexed at 100% so you'd have to take that into account but that stuff
tends to move as the market moves, and I think that's a positive. What's always tougher to predict is the
consumer book, which obviously was a little sticky going up and it generally is a little sticky coming down. And I
think that will be as much a function of micro-market and micro-competitive environment.
So, how are people thinking about those and other sources of funding? If rates do come down quickly, it does
tend to make people being sort of the industry broadly think about wholesale funding differently. So, you might
see more relief on deposits that would cause the consumer to follow faster, but the pace at which consumer bet is
come down is always the question there.

Good morning.

Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Hey, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
On the expense outlook, just want to see if you'd give us some – a little bit more color, I know third quarter came
in a little bit above expectations and some of that is on fee revenue, but as you look at fourth quarter and your flat
expectation for 2024, can you maybe talk about the puts and takes there like, what are some of the areas where
you could see pressure and where do you really see an opportunity to pull back and keep numbers stable? Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, let me just hit the third quarter for a second, John, because I just want to clarify. So, we came in a little
bit high, as you mentioned. I would just point to kind of about $20 million of one-time costs in the quarter related to
a legal reserve billed, a visa settlement that came in late in the quarter, and then some elevated medical claims, I
think net of those we were sort of consistent with the relatively stable guidance.
The core in fourth quarter, we think will be consistent there as well, again relatively stable. Just to reiterate, kind of
pointing out a couple of very or a few very identifiable one-timers, namely FDIC assessment, should it come
through. Some additional expense management related charges, and a pension charge. So, relative or net of
those, we feel like it will be stable. The big move also in the quarter was around personnel and that was primarily
driven by the change in stock price so that, that is a variable but the work that we did earlier in the year as Chris
referenced kind of the beginning of the year getting 2023 flat and some of the work we're doing in anticipation of
making 2024 flat aside from the charges we take will provide a little bit of tailwind on expenses in the quarter.
And we continue to push hard on real estate and things like third-party contracts which we historically have talked
to but we're moving more and more away from third parties and more focused on using our own folks to do the
work we're doing. So, we think we have that circled and there is obviously always surprises that can come
through, but we feel pretty good about the core stability.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
And in that real estate rationalization in the third-party contracts, are they the main areas of opportunity as you
look at 2024 as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
There will be as Chris said, as you kind of shrink the balance sheet, you do have to shrink the expense base, and
our largest cost is personnel. So there will, of course be some personnel related to that, but we are starting to
understand the trajectory of in-office now, and I think we're going to be even more aggressive than we have been

about real estate positioning and again those third-party contracts. So, I would view it as meaningful pieces of all
three of those, but certainly people will be part of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
And John, it's Chris. We'll continue to work across the board on all of these things. We're down from an FTE
perspective in the last year about 900 people, teammates. And so, as we continue to focus on simplifying our
business, streamlining our business being a smaller, simpler, more profitable company, we'll have more to say on
that as we wrap up the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. All right. Thanks, Chris. If I could just ask one last one, on the commercial portfolio, shared national credit,
sorry if I missed this, but have you sized up the size of that shared national credit book and then what portion of it
than your lead agent?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
So, we've never given numbers around the SNC book. Everyone obviously just got their SNC results, and I can
tell you in all my time in this business, our results were the absolute best we've ever had, but we've never
disclosed the numbers in terms of dollars or amounts.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
On the RWA reduction, it sounds like you're saying $10 billion down is the right level and you don't see the need
to do anymore next year, but does that mean you can grow next year and can you lean into loan growth a little bit
in certain areas? And if so, does the level of rates in the tenure matter, right? So, if the tenure moves higher from
here, does that mean you have to do a little bit more on the RWA side or does that not really matter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
So, it's a great question. When I was answering Erika's question, it's Chris – when I was answering Erika's
question, we're not going to be leaning into RWA reduction in the manner that we have this year. But make no
mistake, we will continue to go through every portfolio we have and rationalize our RWAs because that's the raw
material for us to also be expanding our client base. So, we're not done on the RWA side. The point I was trying
to make is at this point in the cycle, we're going to be doing both.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. And then, as we think about cash and liquidity levels, I think you noted there might still be some
more room to bring down cash a little bit. A lot of your peers seem to be building cash quite meaningfully this
quarter. So, how are you thinking about the right levels of liquidity? Is it just a function of you might be replacing
the maturing treasuries with cash or with other low-duration treasuries? And what's the right level do you think you
need to hold right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. Good question. So, historically, Manan, we would've been kind of $2 billion on any given day. I think we
went as high as $11 billion or $12 billion this year. In the kind of $6 billion, $7 billion, $8 billion range in the
quarter, I think we'd migrate that down to $4 billion to $5 billion over time. But your view on as treasuries mature,
holding those in cash or shorter duration treasury portfolio is the right way to think about it.

for this year that you're trying to keep flat, too? Because you have some items coming in 4Q, called out from this
quarter and obviously had some in 1Q as well. So, what's the base as we think about flat cost for 2024 that you're

Matt O'Connor Q

Okay. Sorry, I missed that. And then, just lastly, anything on the criticized loans? Not everybody discloses this,
but you've got a slide in your deck that shows it and it's bumped up a couple of quarters in a row here. Is that just
kind of normal progression or what would you call out there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. That's just – Matt, that's us just very critically grading our portfolio. There'd be a few categories in there as
we look through it. Transportation would be one, healthcare would be another. There're some consumer product
type businesses there, but we take a fair amount of pride in – and Mark Midkiff is here in the room with us, of
really going through with a fine-tooth comb. I don't think there's any additional loss content there. But at this point
in the cycle and you start looking at anyone that has floating rate debt, I think you need to look at that pretty
critically. So, that's really the genesis of it going from 3.3% to 3.9%.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Just one – I had a quick follow-up, Clark, for you. So, I guess, going back to some of the discussion you had with
Ken. When we look at the $46 million in NII that's going to come in from the roll-off in the fourth quarter, your NII
guidance is flat. So, ex that $46 million, NII would be down 5% quarter-over-quarter. Just – and I appreciate
there's a bunch of moving pieces. As we think about the core level of NII beyond fourth quarter, RWA
optimization, deposit repricing, like what's your expectation for those deposits – for NII, sorry, does that NII hold
flat, or do you still expect that NII, just on a core basis, to drift lower?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So – and when you say a core basis – sorry, just, I want to make sure I'm understanding the question – are
you...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
If we remove the lift from the slide 9 that you have from the swaps and the treasury maturities, if we didn't have
that, what in your view would NII do through the next few quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A

Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
...quality of business point to make. But, I think, you're right on puts and takes, and obviously, if rates – using the
forward curve, if rates were to stay flat, we have seen already in the kind of second quarter to third quarter
trajectory, deposit pricing has slowed. I think NIB, while running off still a bit, is stabilizing. So, you'll still see some
drift in those deposit costs. I think the places where – and obviously, we're continuing to shrink the loan book a
little bit, so those create some headwinds. As we did say, though, we are moving aggressively to reduce
wholesale funding costs as well and those are obviously relative to deposit costs generally higher.
So, that will provide a little bit of relief against those, the trends that you're talking about. So, I would focus more
on, what do we think the core business is doing from a performance standpoint, which we would view without
those swaps and treasuries. We did say at or near the bottom on NII, I feel good about that, again, assuming the
forward curve. The one hesitation I have on that, honestly Ebrahim is first quarter, as you know has one fewer
day, which has some impacts and always has seasonality in deposit balances.
So, if you go back a decade other than 2021, which was an anomaly for pandemic-related reasons, we've always
been down kind of 1% to 3% on deposit balances in the first quarter. So those are the components we're working
through and we'll have a clearer, cleaner view on 2024 when we guide on the fourth quarter call.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. Yeah, all I'm trying to get to is if we're at $920 million in the fourth quarter, the roll-off should
take that $900 million to $1.1 billion, something in that vicinity. And I'm just trying to think what would be the
mitigants to getting to a $1.1 billion quarterly NII by the end of next year. But that is good color. Thank you. That's
all I have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Carcache from Wolf Research. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Chris and Clark. I wanted to follow-up on the points you've made around the NII
opportunity from repricing. There's a debate around the possibility that some of the upside from the repricing of
the swaps and the securities could be offset by the need to further reduce RWA levels beyond that $10 billion
level that you've highlighted. And yeah, I think you've talked around some of the surrounding points, but maybe if
you could speak to that specifically, that would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So maybe just to clarify, so that we're all talking about the same thing, that page 9, I believe, which we've
shared a few quarters in a row now, just to make sure, right that is focused on specifically the impact from the
treasuries and the swap. So, as we said before, there're other components when rates go up and that improves.
There are obviously funding pressures as well that come in. And conversely, when rates come down and these
numbers look a little lower, there's funding pressure relief.
So, just want to make sure that we are isolating the thing that we're talking about. As it relates to this pool, Bill,
this is obviously hedging a portion of the loan book and not all of the loan book. So, even if we reduce loans, we
expect we would see the benefits here, but there are obviously NII pressures if we were to continue to reduce the
loan book beyond what we've talked about. Does that answer your question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. No, that is helpful. If I may separately, wanted to ask if you have a – feel like you have a good handle
on Key customers that had put on swaps when we were still in a low-rate environment and are now going to be
facing pressure from rates resetting higher, is there any color that you can give on that dynamic? I know that
credit metrics are very good, but I guess any color on that dynamic across your commercial portfolio and to the
extent that you feel that's contemplated in the allowance that would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, so there's no – Bill, it's Chris. There's no question. One of the things that we are so focused on let's get
back to the answer that I gave around criticized, the increase in criticized loans. We are looking at any customers

that are exposed to rate increases, however they are so exposed. So because we have the primary relationship,
we know a lot about these customers, and to the extent we have visibility on that, yes, we are looking at that, and
yes, it's factored in to our numbers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. Thank you. Thank you for taking my questions.

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Hey, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I want to start. So, on positive operating leverage, if we look at the third quarter, revenues down 17% or so year-
over-year, expense is flat. Just given the trajectory of revenue through 2023, is there any chance you could
deliver positive operating leverage in 2024? And I know you said you plan to hold expenses flat, but do you feel
more of a sense of urgency to do more on the expense side? I think the last time you actually delivered positive
operating leverage, at least of consequence, was 2019.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
So, we'll give, as we mentioned, we're going to give guidance with respect, Steve to 2024 when we report our
fourth quarter numbers. But we do feel the urgency to continue to do more on expenses. And just to remind you,
we took out $200 million of expenses in the first quarter, which is about 4%. And we are actively right now, as I
mentioned, simplifying our business. We're shrinking RWAs. We will come out with more detail in the fourth
quarter. But, yes, we do feel a sense of urgency to rationalize the cost base, particularly because, as I said, we're
going to be a smaller, simpler company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Is there any chance, do you think, Chris, that you do deliver positive operating leverage next year? I know
we've got more next quarter, but how are you thinking right now?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
We'll know more when we finish our planning for 2024, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then separately, obviously, a lot of investor focus on your capital levels. I'm curious given what we've
seen out of the 5-year and 10-year part of the curve so far, how does that change the projected AOCI impact for
year-end, so what you're calling out of slide 13 here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Sorry, Steve, it's Clark, can you just be a little clearer? How does it change...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So, in other words, rates are moving up, which is working against your AOCI. You're saying you used the forward
curve. I don't believe the forward curve in September contemplated the 5-year or 10-year where it is. So, where
you're saying you'll go from negative $6.6 billion to $6.2 billion, how does that $6.2 billion change given what
we've seen in the intermediate part of the curve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Got it. I don't have that number in front of me. It's obviously up, given where we're really sort of focused on the 5-
year. So, we are – we have taken, as we talked about some steps to at least mitigate that. But clearly, when rates
are moving at this magnitude, it can't cover all of it. So we continue to watch that closely. We managed TCE, I
think reasonably well in the quarter, given some of those changes that you've talked about. But we're really
focused on managing – assuming, as Chris said to the contemplated new capital rules and timeframe, making
sure that we're in a position to get our capital to the right level as things phase-in and markets move. And we'll
take the steps that we need to take to be compliant with those rules.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Sure.

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Thanks, Steve.
