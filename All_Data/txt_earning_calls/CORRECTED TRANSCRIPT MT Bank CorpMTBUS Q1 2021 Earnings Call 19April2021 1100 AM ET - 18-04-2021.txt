MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to M&T Bank's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-
answer session. [Operator instruction]
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Don MacLeod to begin. Please go ahead.

Donald J. MacLeod
Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary & Director-Investor Relations, M&T Bank Corp.
Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank you all for participating in M&T's First Quarter
2021 Earnings Conference Call both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings
release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website,
www.mtb.com, by clicking on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events & Presentations link.
Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking
statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer
to our SEC filings on Forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q, including the form we filed in connection with the earnings
release for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements.
Darren King is not with us today and is recovering from the effects of the COVID-19 virus. He expects to rejoin us
shortly. In his absence, M&T's CEO, René Jones, will draw on his skills as former CFO and will be our primary
speaker on today's call.
Now, I'd like to introduce our Chief Executive, René Jones.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Don, thank you for using the word skills. When I handed over the
CFO reins to Darren five years ago, one of the things that I was happy that went with it was the call. But although
Darren is doing well, and we expect his return to action shortly, I boldly volunteered to handle the call today. And
just so you know, my agenda is that I do a good job, but not such a good job that you won't be clamoring to have
Darren back as soon as possible.
Joining me today on the call are Bob Bojdak, our Chief Credit Officer; and Mike Spychala, our Corporate
Controller, whom I'm sure you both know – you know both of them.
As we noted in this morning's press release, we're pleased with the strong momentum in residential mortgage
banking and our Wilmington Trust group of businesses. Outside of our usual seasonal first quarter surge in
salaries and benefits, expenses remained well controlled, and credit trends are indicative of the state of the loan
portfolio and the forecasted improvements in the economy.
Diluted GAAP earnings per common share was $3.33 for the first quarter of 2021, compared with $3.52 in the
fourth quarter of 2020 and $1.93 in last year's first quarter. Net income for the quarter was $447 million compared
with $471 million in the linked-quarter and $269 million in the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&T's first

quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.22% and an annualized return on
average common equity of 11.57%. This compares with rates of 1.30% and 12.07%, respectively, in the previous
quarter.
Included in GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets
amounting to $2 million, or $0.02 per common share; little change from the prior quarter. Also, included in the
quarter's results were merger-related charges of $10 million related to M&T's proposed acquisition of People's
United Financial. This amounted to $8 million after-tax, or $0.06 per common share.
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or
tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as
well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions.
Net operating income for the first quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related
expenses, was $457 million, compared with $473 million in the linked-quarter and $272 million in last year's first
quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share were $3.41 for the recent quarter, compared with $3.54 in
2020's fourth quarter and $1.95 in the first quarter of last year.
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible asset and average tangible common
shareholders' equity of 1.29% and 17.05% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.35% and
17.53% in the fourth quarter of 2020. In accordance with the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release
contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
So, let's take a look at some of the underlying details. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $985 million in
the first quarter of 2021, compared with $993 million in the linked-quarter. This reflects a higher level of average
interest earnings assets, primarily cash equivalents, and a shorter calendar quarter.
The margin for the past quarter was 2.97%, down 3 basis points from 3% in the linked-quarter. The primary driver
of the margin decline was the higher level of cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve, which we estimated
reduced the margin by 5 basis points; and that was partially offset by a 2-basis-point benefit from the shorter
quarter. Similarly, the $8 million linked-quarter decline in net interest income reflects the loss of income from two
fewer accrual days. Changes in interest rates had a minimal effect for the quarter.
Compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, average interest earnings assets increased by some 2%, reflecting a
9% increase in money market placements, including cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve and an 8% decline
in investment securities. Average loans outstanding grew nearly 1% compared with the previous quarter.
Excluding PPP loans, average loans grew $1.1 billion, or over 1%.
Looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared to the linked-quarter, commercial and industrial
loans were essentially flat, with increased dealer floor plan balances and other C&I loans partially offset by lower
average PPP loans. Due to timing of originations and the receipt of payments, average PPP loans declined $453
million from the prior quarter.
Commercial real estate loans declined less than 0.5% compared to the fourth quarter, indicative of very low levels
of customer activity. Residential real estate loans grew by 4%, consistent with our expectations. The increase
reflects purchases of loans from Ginnie Mae pools that we subservice, partially offset by further run-off of the
acquired mortgage loans.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2021
Consumer loans were up nearly 1%. That activity was consistent with recent quarters where growth in indirect
auto and recreational finance loans has been outpacing declines in home equity lines and loans. On an end-of-
period basis, PPP loans totaled $6.2 billion, up from $5.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.
Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Island office and CDs over
$250,000, increased 4%, or $5 billion, compared to the fourth quarter. That figure includes $4 billion of
noninterest-bearing deposits. On an end-of-period basis, core deposits were up nearly $9 billion. Foreign office
deposits decreased 17% on an average basis but were essentially flat on an end-of-period basis.
Turning to noninterest income; noninterest income totaled $506 million for the first quarter compared with $551
million in the linked-quarter. The recent quarter included $12 million of valuation losses on equity securities,
largely the remaining holdings of our GSE preferred stock, while 2020's final quarter included $2 million of gains.
Over the past few years, M&T has received a distribution from Bayview Lending Group in the first quarter of the
year. Results for the first quarter of 2020 included a $23 million distribution. And a change in the past timing, as
you may know, M&T received a $30 million distribution in the fourth quarter of 2020, as expected. No distribution
was received in this year's first quarter.
Mortgage banking revenues were $139 million in the recent quarter, down $1 million from $140 million in the
linked-quarter. Our residential mortgage business continue to perform well. Revenues from that business,
including both originations and servicing activities, were $107 million in the first quarter, improved from $95 million
in the prior quarter. That increase reflects improved gain on sale margins.
Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $1.3 billion in the recent quarter, up about 5% from the fourth
quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $32 million in the first quarter, reflecting a seasonal
decline from $45 million in the linked-quarter. That figure was $30 million in the year-ago quarter.
Trust income rose to $156 million in the recent quarter, improved from $151 million in the previous quarter. The
increase is the result of growth in assets under management, in wealth, and institutional businesses. Service
charges on deposits were $93 million compared with $96 million in the fourth quarter. The decline from the linked-
quarter is the result of higher customer balances offsetting activity-based fees.
Turning to operating expenses for the first quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and
merger-related expenses, were $907 million. The comparable figures were $842 million in the linked-quarter and
$903 million in the year-ago quarter. As is typical for M&T's fiscal first quarter results, operating expenses for the
recent quarter included approximately $69 million of seasonally higher compensation costs relating to the
accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees, the HSA
contribution, the impact of annual incentive compensation payouts on the 401(k) match and FICA payments and
unemployment insurance.
Those same items amounted to an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately $67 million in last year's first
quarter. As usual, we expect those seasonal factors to decline significantly as we enter the second quarter.
Other cost of operations for the past quarter included a $9 million reduction in the valuation allowance on our
capitalized mortgage servicing rights. You'll recall that there was a $3 million addition to the allowance in 2020's
fourth quarter and a $10 million addition in last year's first quarter. The quarter's results also reflect an elevated
contribution to the M&T Charitable Foundation.

The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses
from the denominator, was 60.3% in the recent quarter compared with 54.6% in 2020's fourth quarter and 58.9%
in the first quarter of 2020. Those ratios in the first quarters of 2020 and 2021 each reflect the seasonally elevated
compensation expenses that we talked about.
Next, let's turn to credit. The overall economy of course continues to improve, but some sectors, such as
hospitality, continue to face the pressure. As was the case over the course of 2020, the recent quarter continued
to highlight the differences between the former incurred loss accounting method and the CECL standard adopted
at the beginning of last year.
Previously, reported delinquencies and transition of loans from accruing to non-accruing status evidenced by
financial stress, delinquencies, or default by borrowers, preceded or accompanied the establishment of loss
reserves. Under CECL, we increased our loss reserves last year based on worsening projected economic
scenarios. Significant downgrades of specifically identifiable credits to non-accrual emerged in the fourth quarter
and to criticize in the recent quarter, consistent with last year's additions to the allowance for credit losses.
The allowance for credit losses amounted to $1.6 billion at the end of the first quarter. The $100 million decline
from the end of 2020 reflects a $25 million recapture of previous provisions for credit losses, combined with $75
million of net charge-offs in the first quarter.
The provision recapture and the resulting reduction in the allowance for the recent quarter continue to reflect the
ongoing uncertainty as to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity, employment levels, and the
ultimate collectibility of loans. That said, the improving economic outlook leaves us cautiously optimistic as to the
ongoing effects of the pandemic compared with the greater levels of uncertainty in prior quarters.
Our macroeconomic forecast uses a number of economic variables, with the largest drivers being the
unemployment rate and GDP. Our forecast assumes that the national unemployment rate continues to be at
elevated levels, on average 5.7% through 2021; followed by a gradual improvement, reaching 4.2% by the end of
2022. The forecast assumes that GDP grows at 6.2% annual rate during 2021, resulting in GDP returning to pre-
pandemic levels during 2021. Our forecast considers improved government stimulus but not any further fiscal or
monetary actions.
Non-accrual loans amounted to $1.9 billion, or 1.97% of loans, at the end of March. This was up slightly from
1.92% at the end of last December. As noted, net charge-offs for the recent quarter amounted to $75 million.
Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 31 basis points for the first quarter, compared with
39 basis points in the fourth quarter. Loans 90 days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest, were $1.1
billion at the end of the recent quarter. 96% of those loans were guaranteed by government-related entities.
Turning to capital, M&T's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 10.4%, compared with 10.0% at the end
of the fourth quarter, and which reflects a slight reduction in risk-weighted assets and earnings net of dividends.
As previously noted, the People's United merger is pending. We don't plan to engage in any stock repurchases
activity while that is pending.
Now, turning to the outlook; while the economy continues to improve and funds from stimulus programs reach our
commercial and consumer clients, we haven't seen enough change in our outlook for 2021 in any significant way
from what we shared on the January call, aside from the improved credit outlook, as evidenced by the reserve
release this quarter. I don't intend to provide any updates.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2021
Darren's remarks as to net interest income, loan growth, fees, and expenses still hold. And those, of course,
predate our merger announcement and don't contemplate any impact from the merger. We supply the merger-
related comments at the time of announcement.
Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions
regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events, and other
macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.
So now, let's open up the call to questions before which Maria will briefly review the instructions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from
the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Hi, Ken.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, René. It's like you never left in terms of – given the prepared remarks. All right, maybe just to start-off, in
terms of the reserve release, the way the press release read, and even your comments, it sounds like you guys
are still applying a fair amount of qualitative overlays that are fairly negative that you're – there's a lot of
uncertainty in the market, but you still released reserves pretty meaningfully this quarter. Is it fair to assume that if
the economy continues to get slowly better and some of those qualitative overlays come off, that we could
actually see a more material negative provision expense next quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
I guess the way I'd think about it is, if you look at how our allowance worked at the end of the quarter, we saw
releases in the commercial C&I book and in the consumer book; and those are largely reflective of the GDP and
unemployment projection improvements that you've seen.
And I think the thing to think about, as you know, that one of the unique things about this period of time is that it's
uneven, right? So, while we're having good projections -unemployment's coming down, we've got great
projections of GDP, it's not even everywhere. And so, some of the places that are affected by travel and
entertainment, right, are still lagging behind. So while we've seen things, for example, like higher scheduled
bookings for the summer and the fall, we've really yet to see the improvement, particularly in our CRE and our
hotel exposures.
So, without using the word overlay, I think that we're looking for signs of improvement in those particular areas,
which would be required before we would see any reduction in the reserves on those portfolios.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2021
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then just as a follow-up question. You're obviously building up a fairly
sizable cash position given all the deposit growth. How are you thinking about investing some of that cash into
higher-yielding securities, potentially?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
It's a great question. We give a lot of thought. I think our first thought, it starts with the idea that we probably, at
the end of the quarter, probably had $20 billion of excess liquidity beyond what we would use and use for our
liquidity position. And I think a huge portion of that is clearly related to what I would call transitory. Now, the big
issue is, how long is the transition?
And so when we – first thought that we had is that we hate to invest in low-return assets. So, we don't think it's
our job to invest for you all of that cash and securities because you could go do that off on your own. The returns
are too low. Having said that, we do have one of the smallest securities book out there. And so we're, sort of,
constantly monitoring this idea of how low do we want to make that go?
So, I think maybe the more interesting thing long-term is what's really hard to see is the growth in activity that may
be permanent that's happening over time; the account growth, those types of things, and the behavior of
customers. So I think when we do see – which may not be for a while because of more infrastructure spending
and things like that, but when we do see a return, I think we may see a higher level of cash balances for quite
some time. And as that becomes more clear to us, we would think of investing those dollars. But I think it's a little
too early today.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2021
I just wanted to maybe touch on loan demand. If you can talk a little bit about where you're seeing any
improvement at all, particularly on the commercial side. Really interested in what you're seeing on the pipeline
front. And are you seeing any signs of a pick-up in CapEx activity. And then separately on the consumer side as
well, what you're seeing. Thanks a lot.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So, in the C&I space, I think – I don't know if it's a change, but if you look in the areas of M&A activity, if you
look in the areas of manufacturing, we've seen some progress there. But beyond that it's very slow. Utilization
was either flat to slightly down this quarter. We're seeing very limited, if any, growth – really declines – in the CRE
segment because there's just no demand because of the state of things there.
Having said that, it's interesting, particularly commercial volumes remain low, if you look back, as I did over four,
five quarters. You do see a steady increase in the roll on margin. So, the activity that is getting done is at higher
return levels. So, that should have some impact as we move further; not immediate impact, but as that continues,
that should have some positive impact on the margin. Things still remain really robust on the consumer side with
the exception of HELOC loans.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Got it. Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, separately on the credit quality side, wondering if you could update
us on the commercial real estate portfolio. I know you indicated the areas of stress by industry, but I know you
also noted that there wasn't necessarily a release there on the commercial real estate side. So, if you can just
remind us the size of that reserve as well when you gave the update on the trends? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So what I'll say is, no surprise, hotels continue to be the property type that are under the greatest amount of
stress in our portfolio. And hotel CRE loans were the largest contributor to the increase in our criticized book. And
the thing to think about it is, given the duration of the pandemic and its impact on things like travel, it's really not
surprising that the hotels kind of face greater stress.
So, you'll remember that although performance we're seeing some slight improvement – give me one second –
we've seen some slight improvement, most of our hotel portfolios really can't support the contractual debt service
payments without an in-place modification or, maybe as important, support from their sponsors.
So, what that means is that while you've seen an increase in classifieds – so this quarter, we've seen about $1
billion increase in our classifieds, about half of that was in the hotel space – really, what that is, is just the length
of time. Having said that, we don't expect that those downgrades will contribute to increased risk of loss because
that really depends on other factors like – beyond the credit grade, like the strength of the sponsors and the value
of the underlying collateral. You'll notice that we didn't have much of an increase to nonperformance, for example.
In terms of those two factors, the strength of our collateral, first, what we've been doing is we've been on a
mission to reappraise all of our hospitality properties that are in excess of $5 million and that are in the classified
status. So, that reflects a little over 100 properties, and that accounts for about $2.3 billion in exposure. So, the
first 62 of those appraisals so far through February have shown as-is values that have declined about 15% and
stabilized values that reflect about a 6% decline. Keep that in mind that we're starting with 56% LTV.

M&T Bank Corp.
(MTB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2021
And then if you jump to New York City, we've seen a 24% as-is decline with a 4% stabilized decline; but that
starts with an LTV above 47%, right? So that gives you a sense that the migration we're seeing in classifieds in
this space is pretty normal of what we would have expected, but it's not necessarily an indication of loss content.
And then finally, the last thing I'd say is, in talking to all of our sponsors, they seem to remain strong and capable
of supporting the properties until conditions improve. And we really have a low number of properties, maybe
something like 12%, 13% that come due this year; and a significant portion that are 2023 and beyond, in excess
of 60% that are further out. So, we think we're in a good position to kind of watch this stuff change. I don't know if I
have the numbers on the specific reserve for you.

I know you mentioned no updates on the guidance front for 2021, but the interest rate backdrop does look a little
bit better today versus a few months ago. So, I was just wondering if you can talk about how you're factoring that
in. I know you'd mentioned NII down maybe in the low- to mid-single-digit range for the year at that point. So, I
was just curious what the offsets might be there if it's weaker loan growth or some other area; or maybe you're
thinking that range is still good, but maybe it's the better end of that range is more likely. Just any color there
would be great.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2021
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. No, it's good question. I think we're looking at low single-digit year-over-year change in the margin, decline
in the margin. But I would say that we're off to a good start. If you think about how do you outperform that, your
first quarter is probably the toughest because you were on a declining trend. And so, we're excited that we
actually outperformed there.
And I think the things that we're not sure how long they last, but things like the extended foreclosure moratorium
means that we'll be doing less re-pooling of the Ginnie Mae, it means they'll be on the balance sheet longer,
right? So, that will produce some results, and then the cash balances are relatively high. So, I'd just say we feel
good and optimistic about, at the least, meeting our projections.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dave Rochester Q

Okay. Great. And then maybe just switching to the loan growth front. You mentioned the Ginnie Mae buyouts. I
was just wondering, can you just talk about how that opportunity looks there going forward? And then maybe just
on the overall – just the PPP production for the quarter, and then [indiscernible] (00:29:09) would be great.

perspective this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. Okay. So, on the Ginnies, the Ginnies, it will be hard to continue to find places to purchase Ginnies. We
keep working on it, but at the end of the day, particularly again because of the foreclosure modification and the
extension going out, we think there's just going to be fewer opportunities to do that.
In terms of the PPP loans...

Yeah. We booked $2.5 billion in PPP [ph] 2 (00:29:54) during the quarter, most of that in March; and then we had

What I will tell you is that when you take a step back and think about the margin that we have, the excess cash, if
you take the $20 billion that I talked about before, if you didn't have that, that essentially takes your printed margin
up over 50 basis points. And if you also exclude all of the PPP activity balances and now the income, that has
about a 9-basis-point impact in the other direction. So, what really is interesting to me is that, aside from those
two factors, our margin has held up really, really well compared to historical terms. But it's just a little noisy; you
can't see it because of those two items.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
There you go. Got a question for you. As you touched on already about the high amounts of liquidity that you
have on your balance sheet, the cash sitting at the Federal Reserve being up so dramatically like the entire
industry because of quantitative easing and such. I guess, one of the questions I have for you is I can understand
why JPMorgan Chase and some of our big money center banks have seen such a surge in deposits because of
quantitative easing. Can you walk through for us how the flow is coming into your organization in terms of the
deposits that's forcing you now to increase your deposits – in your reserves up to the central bank?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. That's a great question. What you have to do is just to kind of go back prior to the pandemic and think
about our operating model. We, more than most, focus on core operating accounts, right? So we have never had
a need to actually do a national – what are they called [indiscernible] (00:32:55) Internet bank that raises money
across the network. We're always raising money predominantly in our customer businesses with operating
accounts.
And so what you're going to see when that happens with operating accounts, all of the cash from the stimulus, all
of the cash from the monetary events that have taken place are actually going into customer accounts. And
because our proportion of customer accounts and core operating accounts are higher than most institutions, you
see the impact on M&T is outsized.
Now, that means that we've got to manage it very closely. So today, for example, we're making sure that sort of
nobody is renting our balance sheet for free and just parking money that nobody else wants; again, core operating
concepts. But that's the principal reason. And you can actually draw a comparison between a percentage of both
DDA and let's say, transaction accounts, if you get that information across institutions, and go before the crisis,
and then look today, you'll see, that's the differentiator.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2021
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then to bring those balances down, it's not necessarily that you're going to take higher interest
rates where they would maybe move the money out; it would be more business activity picking up where they
utilize the cash to grow their businesses?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Exactly. Exactly. So, that's one of the things that you'll begin to see. I think you're going to see, both on the
consumer side and business, more spending. I think it might be one of the factors which gives us the most
uncertainty about loan growth, because there's so much cash that's been built up.
And then if you start looking at certain factors, it's not just sentiment. Remember, for example, with middle-market
companies, the supply chains are still not fully unlocked and back to normal, right? So, that's preventing people
from maybe building up inventories. A very classic example would be the auto industry and so forth.
But you got that exactly right. I would expect to see that a fair portion of this starts to increase spending, both from
consumers and commercial. I also think – this is my own opinion – that events like pandemics will linger for a very
long time, and the idea that customers are going to keep higher ongoing levels of cash as a permanent way of
doing business makes a lot of sense to me.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up question, and you touched on it in the answer you just gave me, you're one of
the better floor plan financiers throughout the Northeast with autos. Can you talk to us to the very issue about the
supply chain? There's quite a bit written about the shortage of semiconductor chips affecting the production of
automobiles. What are your dealers telling you, and how are they doing right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Well, I think the dealerships are all doing fine, right, because the activity there is that it's very difficult to get new
cars. But having said that, there's a search around, right, for used cars. And so as things – for example, as your
car comes off lease, right, if you don't actually take on and buy that car, they had some nice source of cars into
the dealers. And this is one of the principal reasons why used car prices are so high, right?
If you're thinking about the third quarter of last year, we thought were sort of record highs on used car prices, and
we thought that by the fourth quarter that would start to come down. But those supply chains really haven't
unlocked and the prices are just continuing to go up, which means the dealers are really healthy. There's sort of a
nice natural offset for them.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Hey, Matt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Just to push maybe one last time here on the cash part of the discussion. So, you definitely seem
more confident that some of the cash is going to stick. We've seen a pretty material rise in rates, although off of a
really low level; and your loan trends are better than peers, which I want to ask for my second question, but it's
still just very modest growth.
Like, what are you waiting for to buy some securities? And if you have loaded up on securities, I'd ask you why
you're buying so much. So, I ask at the extremes, because if we took all your cash and put it in like some other
banks, I think it adds about 10% to earnings. So, what are you waiting for?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
So, this is how it goes, Matt. This is how it goes internally, right. So, Darren and I call up Scott Warman and we
ask that exact question every month; what are you waiting for? And then, what we find out is we're really, really
happy when the 10-year was at its low that he didn't respond to us. But when the 10-year got itself up to the 170s
range, we've dipped our toe back in the market, but not significantly, because we just kind of look through and we
think that these bond prices don't make much sense from a long-term perspective, and we know that, right.
So, while we could make a little bit more money, we're constantly focused on risk-adjusted returns, are we making
the right decisions? So, while we might purchase a few more securities, I don't it being a meaningful move or a
meaningful change in the way we position it, unless we see better risk-adjusted returns on those portfolios.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald J. MacLeod A
Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary & Director-Investor Relations, M&T Bank Corp.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So, a separate question. The loans ticked up a little bit this quarter. I think the industry overall was down kind of
2% to 3%. You already touched on like the Ginnie Mae purchases. PPP now a big swing factor. You're probably
benefiting from not having as much card run off, but it still feels like ex everything, loan trends are a little more
resilient. And I'm wondering if you would agree, and what's driving that. And then, of course, when things pick up,
M&T usually doesn't lead the pack in terms of loan growth, but how do you think you'll fare versus the industry
from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
I think that our C&I customers are more optimistic than they were last quarter and the quarter before. I think that
sentiment will continue to change. I think you're going to see more activity, and the question will be a matter of
timing, do they use their cash and do they come up? But the trends, if you look at this quarter, it's actually pretty
decent on the C&I space, when you net out the PPP effect. So, commercial real estate, I don't expect to do much
for the near-term. I think there's obviously a lot of pain there, but there's also a lot of resetting going on.
The one place where I think we've talked about and everybody has talked about, warehouse and industrial; the
issue there, though, is because it's the only class in real estate that prices – again, pricing and economics have
been competed away, so it doesn't make any sense from an economic perspective for us to lean into that space.
So, look, I think we're optimistic about loan growth for the long-term, but it's just going to take some time to start
moving in the right direction.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2021
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. Well, it's kind of funny, the actual and just the whole process of integration is really getting at that, right?
What I would start by saying is, we sort of set up our transition teams. Everybody on each sides of both
organizations have met. Everything that we've seen, particularly on the businesses that we're not really part of
have confirmed everything that we saw in due diligence.
Number two, we're super impressed with their talent and their people, and we've done a lot of acquisitions.
Among all of them, this one sort of stands out, where the people who are running the business are really capable,
including the couple of businesses that we don't have.
So, there's a lot of dialogue going on just around exactly what you're talking about. And I'll just remind you that we
think, for example, from the M&T side, some of the capabilities that we have with small business banking, our key
treasury management, capital markets expertise, extending that to their customer base is going to provide a
significant opportunity.
We have M&T Realty Capital Corp. which allows us to meet the needs of real estate clients, but not necessarily
use our balance sheet for that. And that's a new capability for them. And of course, Wilmington Trust, combined
with their wealth, I think we're going to bring a lot more capabilities combined than we would individually to the
New England markets. If you go the other way, we're very excited and continually excited about the equipment
finance business and being able to offer those services to M&T's small business and middle-market customers.
And so it's not a short list, right, which is sort of one of the principal reasons that we felt that we could do a better
job for our collective customers together than separately.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Understood. Just to follow up on – not to beat a dead horse, but to follow up on the excess liquidity discussion.
Your rationale makes a ton of sense, but I guess just looking at the numbers we've seen, the securities portfolio
go from over 14% of your average earning assets in 2017 to just under 5% this quarter. At some point – and
you've talked around this, but maybe could you just give a little bit of color on the extent to which you're worried
that, at some point, you're competitively disadvantaged, you have nothing else from the NII opportunity that you're
foregoing, even if it comes with some interest rate risk; but maybe a little bit of color around that point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
I'll just simply say, Bill, you're thinking about it the right way, right. I think that we're very disciplined in that we look
at almost every trade. But you really have to step back and look at the overall balance sheet. We're below $7
billion in securities, right? And so, at some point, you're really only going to go so low. But if you compare that to
when you make that decision and think on average where the 10-year has been – not today, but where it's been –
we're really happy with our decision.
But at the same time, you're totally right; like, you got to look at it as a portfolio. And we do believe and we're
getting more and more evidence, particularly as new programs come in, like the infrastructure build that they're
talking about next, right, it gives us some sense that the risk is lowering and that the cash may be around a little
bit longer. So, we'll have to look at that overall portfolio and realize how small can the securities portfolio get.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Good morning, René.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Hi, Peter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
I wanted to ask about asset sensitivity. In prior calls, Darren had said for each 25-basis-point rate hike, NIM
benefits 6 to 10 basis points. But the balance sheet has gotten so much more asset sensitive. And so, I was
wondering, can you just give an update to the impact of NIM from rate hikes? And then, secondly, are there any
plans to maybe reduce asset sensitivity with layering in some swaps?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
So, first of all, the numbers that Darren gave, like you just cited last quarter haven't changed much at all. We're
pretty much in the same position. But it's sort of the same topic, right. I mean, so by putting on swaps, you're
turning a floating rate asset into a fixed-rate asset. Said another way, you're adding to your fixed rate exposure,
and you could do the same things with securities, right, but we're really cautious about doing that. And as Don
said, locking in negative economic returns.
So it's a good thing. I mean, another way to say it is that, if you're worried about the negative economic returns,
one offsetting factor is that you're actually neutralizing yourselves, right, because we all think that rates can't go
below zero, but that's not true. And so, there is some added benefit to that. But the swap issue is the same as the
securities issue to me.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then, can I just ask about the credit outlook, just how you're thinking about net charge-offs for the
remainder of the year, especially with not expecting much loss content in the hospitality portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. I think what Darren has talked about is that we'll continue to remain at or maybe slightly above our historical
average. I think our term averages in the mid-30s, [indiscernible] (00:47:21) range. I think that – if you think about
– just to give you a sense, if you think about gross charge-offs net of recoveries, we're about $122 million last
quarter, $123 million this quarter. Pretty steady.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2021
What was different about this that brought us down to 31 basis points is that we had about $23 million, $24 million
more of recoveries. One of those, for example, was on a company that's a supplier to the energy business or the
fracking business, a supplier of services there. And the rest of them were across the board, a smaller number of
recoveries.
So the consistent trend, I think, is kind of there, underlying that. It's hard to predict what's going to happen with
recoveries. But I think Darren's comments makes sense, maybe at or maybe slightly above for some period of
time our long run average.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi. Good morning. Hey, René. Just one question on the fee side. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks
that the residential-related fees were up and helped by higher gain on sale margins, which is a nice bucking of the
trend versus most industry peers. Can you just talk us through, was that about timing or about mix, re-
securitization, and your forward thoughts on just how the mortgage business should act going forward? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. You got it right; timing and mix, that's a perfect statement. I think if you were to look at underlying margins
as you think about purely margin to the customer, those were flat to slightly down, but there was a lot of noise in
volume and rates moving around in between. And so, that sort of market sensitivity allowed us to capture more
economics. And so, the overall gross margin was higher.
If I saw something that was slightly encouraging, it was that while we had maybe just under 4% increase in
applications, our pipeline at the end of the quarter was up 5.5%. So, we kind of ended the quarter with the same
momentum that we had or maybe slightly better than we did during the quarter. So, that should help as we next
quarter. I mean, hard to predict what's going to happen with margin, but that core underlying trend was slightly
negative.

or is that more of a closing quarter type of thing that you would do on the donation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
So, no. What we did this quarter was separate from what we will do for People's, which we'll decide at the time of
the close. So, what we did this quarter is, I think, we just had a slightly elevated number. I think we made
contributions of $12 million, and we typically have been doing about $3 million. I think last quarter was around $3
million.

Hi, Frank. Let me guess, you're going to ask about cash.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
No, I was going to, but after the fourth question, I decided to stray. But I only have – yeah, I mean just on how
much – I'm trying to figure out how much capital might still be locked up in reserves, not only for M&T, but for
everybody. And so, just following up on the potential for additional reserve release. Is the best way to think about
where the reserve to loan ratio sort of flushes out in a more normal environment? Just look back at CECL day one
mark for you guys and for others. And so for an M&T, maybe 1.3%, I think is where you guys were. Is that still the
most reasonable place to put it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I think – I'll say this, I mean, I don't disagree with what you said. But what it comes down to is
what's your loan mix and what's the quality of your underwriting. And that, for us, really hasn't changed. So today,
if I were to sit here to say – answer the question, could we get back to where we were in our lows or our normal?
Sure. We're going to still see the same cycle, [ph] a little bit (00:53:22) sharper. But in a calmer, more neutral
environment, we would probably look like we did in the past.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on PPP forgiveness. You still have a significant level of 2020 PPP loans on
the books. And just wondering your thoughts on does the majority of that run off the books in the current quarter?
How should we think about that from modeling?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
No, we have it running down sort of over time. There's no sort of sharp drop in that space. So, I mean, as you're
thinking about quarter-over-quarter and getting your way through the year and into next, that's what I would think
about it. It'd be a steady drop. I think if you take Mike's comments, you kind of get a sense of the ins and outs.
And so, I think we – on the original PPP loans are we 50% of the way through, has been run off? 50% of the
original PPP loans, which started at about $7 million, $6.5 billion, are now gone and 50% are there. So, that
should give you some sense.

Hey, Mike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, René. Your CEO letter talks about new approaches with business banking from Baltimore, Washington,
Philly, Delaware, Virginia, you have the iHeartRadio and interviews with 130 local CEOs. So, it seems like you're
still revising your approach locally.
My question is, what metrics do you track to monitor your progress, and how those metrics changed and where
do you hope those metrics will go? I know you're not talking about the People's United transaction, but it would
give a better sense for – are you looking at market share by MSA; are you looking at average fees for business
customer; or what else are you looking at to monitor your progress?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
I think you'll be happy to know it's not fancy. We measure the amount of checking accounts – business banking
checking accounts we open every month against the amount of checking accounts that we close. On the ones
that we close, we're trying to find the friction points and make things easier, so that they're not leaving and
transitioning out.
And it's very interesting that you asked the question, because, I mean, we've seen just – I would just – I'll just use
the words, I mean, let's see how permanent it is, but we've seen a dramatic increase in our business banking
DDA production, primarily driven by new customer acquisition. And I think what's happening is, that's a
combination of this idea that we've been introduced as a trusted partner through the PPP program, we've been
introduced to a lot more customers. And at the same time, it's not been that long since we launched our small
business online origination channel.
And so, what we're seeing is the combination of those two things, I guess, people's awareness about our
capabilities and what we do have actually increased. So really simple, every quarter, what's happening with
checking accounts, are we opening them; are they from existing customers; new customers; what are the MSAs
they're working in?
I have a real big bent on empowering our teams in the individual communities. So the way in which do things in
Boston or New Hampshire might be different than Baltimore, but the expectation on the metrics are going to be all
the same; how many quality checking account are reopening, not necessarily how much lending we're doing,
because we think all that leads to a healthy company will end up in the end doing loans and things like that with
us.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And just to follow up, do you have any aggregate metrics that you expect that called out from the approach? Like I
said, it could be market share by MSA or fees, or just the level of growth; or is one region lagging behind another
region? Is, like, the Southern portion a little behind?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. Well, I mean, a couple of things we look at. We look at – we've talked about a lot. We're doing a lot around
Net Promoter Score. We do a lot around the Greenwich work. And if you think about the Greenwich work
underneath, it doesn't just tell you that you made a lot of loans; it tells you how – they survey your customers and
they tell you where you stack up. So, do you do business with us; are we your lead bank? We sort of measure
those things religiously.
And, yeah, I think what you'll see is, usually it's the most [ph] volume thing (00:58:29) we have is ranked. We talk
about it all the time. Are we the number one, number two SBA lender? If we're not the number one or two in our
markets, then why and what's happening in those spaces? Even that SBA rank is not a pure thing, because it
doesn't cover everything, but it's a huge indicator of the activity and how engaged our workforce is, if they're not in
the number one, two, or three spot in the community.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Sorry about that. I was on mute. Thanks for taking my question. But how much in hedge income did you earn this
quarter from your swap book? I think you said $275 million for the full year. I don't think you gave a number...

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2021
It's about $90 million this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
It's about $90 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
I will say, and I'm sure – I'm in this little temporary. I'll get the stage for one morning. But I tend not to worry about
too much about looking at hedges on their own because the hedge always matters in the context of the rest of the
portfolio. And so, to the extent that we decided to slow down our hedging or stop the hedging, what basically
you're left with is you're moving away from – you've turned floating rate assets into fixed rate assets. You're
moving them back basically. And the question is, what's happening with the rest of the portfolio? In past
recessions, we would see much higher margin on our roll-on commercial loans, and that would be replacing the
rundown in the hedges. And so, the real issue is loan growth in my mind. That's how I think about it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Right. Right [indiscernible] (01:00:41)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Darren will change that next week. So, you only have 90 days to think the way I do. [indiscernible] (01:00:49)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good. Got it. Just if I could pivot over to capital, how you're thinking about your optimal capital position once the
deal closes? And I think you've talked about 10% CET1 yield, subject now to the June 2020 results. So that
seemingly gives you a healthy cushion. And I believe you talked in the past about being, sort of, at the lower end
of your peer group., So putting all that stuff together, like, how are you thinking about capital returns and capital
optimization and optimal capital as we head into 2022?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
René F. Jones A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah, your construct is right. Ultimately, our desire is to run towards the lower end of our peers. I think the context
to think about is, we went under a really, really hard stress test last fall [indiscernible] (01:01:45) last fall. And we
went into that test around 9.4%, and we were able to survive pretty severe space, particularly in the real estate
space, which we...

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah.

...have high concentration in. We're 100 basis points above that today, right. So that tells you – that starts to tell
you the excess part. The other thing is, I think, we're going to see a change, not immediately, but over time,
around real estate exposure and how we think about those things. Because to the extent that there's, sort of, a de
facto assumption of losses on real estate in the teens when you book it, right, well, that begins to change the
economic and we have to think about our portfolios. Because we believe just being efficient use of capital is really
important. So, we thought a lot about how we might do certain things differently in the commercial real estate
space. And to the extent that we do, that means that, that will be even postion us better to be at the lower end of
our peers.
