Joseph R. Ficalora
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast, and thank you for joining us today as we discuss
our fourth quarter and full year 2019 operating results and performance. Earlier this morning, we reported diluted
earnings per common share of $0.20 for the three months ended December 31, 2019, that is up 5% compared to
both the previous quarter and the year-ago quarter and slightly ahead of consensus. We are extremely pleased
with the company's performance during the fourth quarter. In many ways, it was the strongest quarter of the year
for us and marks a significant inflection point in terms of improved fundamentals. We are encouraged by the
strong rebound in loan growth during the quarter as well as the linked-quarter improvement in net interest income
and net interest margin.
With the Federal Reserve lowering short-term interest rates three times during the second half of last year, the
expected benefit to our net interest margin and the net interest income has started as both of those metrics
improved during the current quarter.
Turning now to our financial performance, as I mentioned earlier, our loan growth rebounded nicely during the
fourth quarter as total loans increased $1 billion compared to the third quarter of the year and rose $1.7 billion or
4% on a year-over-year basis. Multi-family and specialty finance lending drove the loan growth during the year
and the quarter. Multi-family loans increased $893 million dollars or on a linked-quarter basis and $1.3 billion or
4% on a year-over-year basis. Our specialty finance business had another strong quarter and an outstanding year

as the portfolio increased $690 million or 36% on a year-over-year basis. Origination activity also rebounded
strongly during the fourth quarter of 2019. We originated $3.3 billion of loans during the quarter. That's up 45%
compared to the previous quarter. And on a year-over-year basis, total originations were up 5%.
Multi-family originations totaled $2 billion this quarter, up 69% compared to the prior quarter, while CRE
originations of $327 million increased 6%. This was the highest combined level of multi-family/CRE originations
since the fourth quarter of 2017. We also originated almost $800 million of specialty finance loans this quarter.
That's up 25% compared to the previous quarter.
In addition to the strong origination activity during the fourth quarter, we also opportunistically repurchased $771
million of multi-family loans previously originated by us and sold to other financial institutions. These loans were
originally sold by us in order to stay below the SIFI threshold.
Overall, this was one of the strongest quarters for loan growth in over two years and we continue to be
encouraged by the potential loan growth in 2020 as the pipeline started the year off strongly. Currently, it stands
at $1.5 billion, of which 66% is new money.
As a reminder, the pipeline is at a point in time we typically originate more than what is in our pipeline as was the
case this quarter.
On the funding side, total deposits were relatively unchanged compared to the previous quarter and were up $893
million or 3% year-over-year. The year-over-year growth was led, in large part, by CDs which increased $2 billion
or 17% in 2019, but declined modestly compared to the previous quarter. Our wholesale borrowings rose $931
million on a linked-quarter basis and was primarily used to fund our loan growth during the fourth quarter as
wholesale funding was a more attractive funding alternative during the past quarter.
On the revenue front, we were very pleased to see top line revenue growth return this quarter. Net interest
income increased $6.6 million or 11% annualized compared to the previous quarter as interest expense decline.
We also witnessed an improvement in the net interest margin during the fourth quarter as it rose 5 basis points
compared to the third quarter.
Excluding the impact from prepayment fees, the fourth quarter margin would have been 1.90%, up 2 basis points
and in-line with expectations. This was driven by a decline in our overall cost of funds and marks the first time
since the fourth quarter of 2015 that both net interest income and the margin increased. We expect both of these
measures improving throughout 2020 given our liability-sensitive balance sheet, the Feds' current interest rate
policies and the significant re-pricing opportunities embedded within our CD portfolio and wholesale borrowings.
Moving on to operating expenses, total non-interest expenses were $126.1 million, compared to $123.3 million in
the prior quarter, and a $135 million in the year-ago quarter. The efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter was 48.51%
compared to 47.37% during the previous quarter and 49.92% during the year-ago quarter. Over the past 2.5
years, we have reduced our operating expenses by approximately $150 million and will continue to focus on cost
containment going forward.
On the asset quality front, our asset quality measures remained strong during the quarter and the year. Non-
performing assets totaled $74 million or 14 basis points of total assets while non-performing loans were $61
million or 15 basis points of total loans.

Net charge-offs remained at low levels, totaling 5 basis points of average loans for the year and only 1 basis point
of average loans during the fourth quarter. The majority of our charge-offs this year were related to taxi medallion
loans. That portfolio has been in runoff mode over the last two years and now stands at $55 million. Importantly,
we have now been operating under the new regulation laws for six months and to-date we are not seeing any
negative asset quality trends in the rent-regulated segment of our multi-family loan portfolio.
As noticed on page 10 of today's investor presentation, 60% or $18.7 billion of our total multi-family portfolio is
subject to New York State rent regulation laws. The weighted-average LTV on this portion of the multi-family
portfolio is 53%, about 400 basis points less than the weighted-average LTV on the entire multi-family portfolio.
Lastly, this morning, we also announced that the board of directors declared a $0.17 cash dividend per common
share for the quarter. The dividend will be payable on February 24 to common shareholders of record as of
February 10. Based on yesterday's closing price, this represents an annualized dividend yield of 5.80%.
On that note, I would now ask the operator to open the line for your questions. We will do our best to get to all of
you within the time remaining. But if we don't, please feel free to call us later today or this week. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our
first question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities
So, I guess the first question just around loan growth only if I – two-part to it: One, if I take out the $771 million in
purchase, loan growth, I guess, on an organic basis still seemed a little soft. So, would love to hear just in terms
of your loan growth outlook for the multi-family and the overall loan book for 2020? And I think, the last time you
updated on participation was in 2016 where you had about $3 billion to $4 billion in loans that had been
participated. So, if you could remind us how much additional opportunity there is to repurchase some of those
loans back?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We really have about $2 billion or more that we could do there. But the thing is, the market is strong and we'll
have the ability to originate well within our appetite over the period ahead.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Ebrahim, it's Tom. I would add to Joe's commentary that, obviously, the focus here is to analyze, be in the market.
We're very effective in the market. We see very strong economic spreads compared to the previous year since
the rent laws have changed. But, more importantly, when you take some of the one-off transactions that we
anticipate to go away in the fourth quarter versus Q3, which is a very volatile quarter, we saw our retention rate
improve slightly which is a good signal.
Our goal for 2020 is to go back to that predictable retention rate historically, which would be much higher when
you compare it to the past – the second half of 2019. So, when you think about that and you model it, modeling a
mid-single-digit loan growth is very reasonable for our appetite in the market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities
Got it. Mid-single-digit loan growth. And I guess, Tom, on the core margins, it went up 2 basis points in line with
your guidance. How should we think about the margin going forward? And just in terms of where the CD book is
re-pricing relative to the $237 million cost in the fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Right, Ebrahim. As you know, I don't go on a limb more than three months in the margin because obviously
they're very interesting environment. But, clearly, we had the inflection point as we expected in the fourth quarter
2019 and we continue to see very strong visibility throughout the full year of 2020 with margin expansion every
quarter as well as the growth in NII. So, NII inflected in 2019 Q4 as expected, up 2 basis points in the fourth
quarter. I would say for the first quarter, we'll have a higher NII expansion and probably another 2 basis points in
the margin. And that's assuming no changes in interest rates and it excludes any prepayment penalty income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities
So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, the continuation of margin expansion throughout 2020. We're liability-sensitive and we have a substantial
amount as you indicated, CDs that will re-price to about $14.2 billion, and it's throughout the entire year. The
lowest quarter of the re-pricing – actually, the second lowest quarter is the first quarter was $2.8 million at a
2.29% rate and Q2 was about $4.5 million at almost a 2.40% rate. So, we really have a lot of re-pricing
expectations going forward given where current interest rates are. And if you look at where CDs are coming on,
it's just slightly south of 2%. I think the number was like 1.88% in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities
So, I guess just to be clear, Tom, you expect the margin expansion of 2 basis points. Is it safe to assume given
what you said that that accelerates, so we should see – I know you don't want to give guidance beyond three
months, but all else equal, should we see the 2 basis points become 4, 5, 6 basis points like – and accelerate as
2020 progresses because that's kind of where Street expectations are.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Again, I feel really good that we have the inflection point. I'm not going to give long-dated guidance, but I
was very clear that I see margin expansion throughout the year. But, more importantly, the NII growth is
significant for us. We haven't seen that since the first – second half – first half of 2016. So, the inflection point is
here, we're liability-sensitive, we have a lot of liabilities we're pricing. So, on the liability side, we get good benefit.
In addition to the borrowings, in CDs, we have borrowings which is material for us. And borrowing rates compared
to what's coming off is significantly attractive to us in 2020 and 2021.

Good morning, Brock.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning, guys. Okay. So, you covered the CD aspect. On the wholesale borrowings, I know you were pretty
creative last year in using some of these hybrid FHLB structures. The borrowing costs ticked down a bit this
quarter. What should we look for in the near-term in terms of a relief on the borrowing cost?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'll just be specific with the actual numbers. We have $3.7 billion that comes due within 2020 at a 2.11% rate. We
put on a trade yesterday at about 1.47% and that was about a $0.5 billion and that was based on LIBOR, home
loan bank floating LIBOR, and we swapped it out for three years with a swap, which got a course to 1.47%. So,
we're locked in there for three years with very little basis risk.

New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
(NYCB) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
So that's kind of what we've been doing recently. So we'll continue doing that depending on market opportunities.
We're not going to – when you look at where our short-term funding is, it's probably a 35 basis points benefit to
lock it up and swap it out after 2.5 to 3 years. So, we'll take advantage of that opportunity given the shape of the
curve. And when you go into 2021, you have another $823 million at a 2.40% rate. So, for the next two years, we
have some high-cost money compared to the market that could be re-priced lower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And near term, is there anything we should be aware of for Q1 on that front?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think it's continuing. I think it's going to be an ongoing benefit each month. We have – it's staggered throughout
the quarter just like the CDs. I think in Q2, for the CDs, we'll have a substantial benefit given it's almost double the
amount in Q1 and it's at the highest cost of the year. So, [ph] 2.38% (00:17:38) is the highest cost that we have
rolling off on Q2 for CDs and that money is coming. Our [indiscernible] (00:17:43) for right now is at 1.65% at
three months and nine months at 1.85% and our 12-month look with CD is at 1.50%. So, if you tag on a few basis
points to your elite customers, it's still well below 2%. So, you're going to get a nice benefit on the CD front for the
run rate next year.

Good morning. I guess, Tom, you certainly laid out the case for a lot of opportunity for the liabilities to re-price
lower but I guess we've heard this for a few quarters now and your core NIM is only going up about 2 basis points
per quarter. Can you just walk us through the other side of the balance sheet? I mean obviously, with the five-year
Treasury like 1.44%. I mean is it just simply a matter that the loans are re-pricing a lot lower that offsets a lot of
this liability benefit?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Ken, let me be clear, I didn't give any guidance other than past Q1 on the margins, so that's your
expectation. But, no, we're very bullish about the fact that the fund cost is going to be low and our yields, for the
most part, should be in a good position depending on where our interest rates go. We really don't know where our
rates are going to be at the end of the year, but we have a sizable book of business that's coming during 2020
and 2021. The multi-family portfolio is about $3.3 billion at a 3.18% coming due in 2020; 2021 to $3.8 billion at
3.32%. When you look at those rates compared to market rate, we've seen a lot of volatility in rates.
We've been effectively pricing our multi-family/CRE business at a healthy spread compared to what it was a year
ago. So that 200 basis point spread is real. Yes, rates have come down but we still have a very good offering at
them. We've going to be very competitive.
I think the plan for 2020 is to focus on our intention. We are going to be very focused on bumping that retention
rate up to historical norms. We've had a nice improvement when you take some of the one-off deals from Q3
versus Q4. But Q3 in 2019, we had lots of retention go away and a lot of that was because of, we'll call it,
aggressive underwriting and aggressive agencies. We're going to be laser-focused to move that retention. When
you move the retention to a higher percentage for more normality for NYCB, you'll see the loan growth kick in.
That's our goal for 2020. At the same time, you'll see where the market is on security, we have a very small
securities portfolio. There's really not a whole lot of benefit right now to put capital and liquidity to work at this
level. So we're being mindful of keeping it relatively flat until we see opportunities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got you. Okay. So if I paraphrase that, it sounds like you're going to get NIM expansion but most of the NII growth
is going to come from the balance sheet growth rather than the NIM side, right, if I understand that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Again, depending where the interest rates are. Obviously, if you would categorize...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
...that more of the fourth quarter, rates were dramatically higher, right? Look where rates are today. But they
move around quite a bit and we're very effective to get that 200 basis points spread. That's a much healthier
spread we have seen and probably a good post-crisis because pre-crisis it was a 110 basis point spread, it went
back to 150 basis point. Then ultimately when the rent control laws have changed, we believe the 200 basis
points is more than fair spread and we're seeing some good activity there.
Our lending people are very busy. Our focus is on making sure we have strong retention. We have all the data.
We have all the loan files, we know what's coming due and we're going to work very hard to maintain our share.
At the same time, we were very opportunistic in the previous quarter to take advantage of some other people that

are looking at divesting their position in multi-family, including some of our partners on participation and we'll be
active there as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got you. Okay. And then switching gears just a little bit. In terms of expenses, it looks like they were a little bit
above your guidance from – that you gave last quarter. Any reason for the increase this quarter and what do you
think about expenses going into first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, number one, I would say I commend the entire team on the expense containment control we've had for two
years. It's been a very difficult two years to keep those expenses down significantly. So we had, obviously, a very
strong expense number, right? We didn't want it within our guidance. We probably beat, for the most part,
throughout the year but for the most part we came, I'd say, slightly better than what management expected for the
expense guide for 2019. As far as 2020, we believe that it's going to be relatively stable.
I don't want to go on a limb yet but I think it's fair to say that stabilization of our expenses are going to be key, cost
containment. We have a few items that are going to increase our expenses slightly. We have instituted a 401(k)
match for the first time as a public company. We have increased our minimum wage for our metro employees to
$15 an hour, so we're being competitive because it is a changing universe in the New York metro area as far as
compensation cost and we've also released the salary freezes for offices.
So my guess is probably looking at maybe another $10 million of expenses when you look at year-over-year,
when you normalize the expense base for 2019. So although we printed a higher number, when you normalize
that, you're looking from a $505 to $515 million, another $10 million as far as potential run rate for 2020.

containment initiatives over the past few years and we're going to still be efficient. Our conversion yet has not
completed. We anticipate to have that by Q2, that's probably dragging a little bit. We'll get some benefit there in

One is on prepayments, I'm just wondering what expectations are for the full year? I missed how much you said
Tom that was coming due in terms of loan maturities this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So we have approximately $3.3 billion of multi-family loans, about 3.18%; that will be contractually maturing this
year. They have to come to the table. At the same time in 2021 books, about another $3.8 billion at 3.32%. They
have to come to the table in the next year – in the next two years. So, we feel very optimistic that there'll be
elevated prepayment activity; depending on the economic dollars, depends on when they decide to prepay and
refinance with us or away from us.
That being said, we had a relatively strong Q4 on prepay. Activity was strong. Q3 versus Q4, I would say was a

quarter. We anticipate to have a very strong follow-through as we go through 2020 given the dynamics of the
marketplace.
There are some interesting deals that hit the market. And when you look at what buyers are looking at
transactions, the hurdle rate of returns are higher but they're getting it done. So there's been that zero activity
starting to move slowly towards buyers and sellers. Yes, it's a Q4. Activity always happens on Q4 but we see
deals being done, which is interesting because the hurdle rate of returns are reasonable and these are 100% tied
to multi-family rent-regulated buildings being transacted at levels that are reasonable. Tax rates are very
reasonable. They're not elevated.
So, I'd say the reaction to the rent controls changes that hurdle rate of returns for long-term property owners are
higher, they're getting some transactions done and we believe that will continue as we move further away from
the enactment of the new change of the law.

Steve Moss Q

Okay. And then just in terms of new money yields here, just wondering where you're seeing spreads for multi-
family and CRE these days?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. We've been holding solid at 200 basis point, probably another [ph] an eighth to quarter (00:25:41) above
that for CRE. We're going to adjust to be competitive, but we've done a fine job since June on making our
presence known that we need to get paid a higher premium compared to historical premiums of about 150 basis
point spread on the Treasury. So, it's still hovering around 200s, give-or-take, [ph] an eighth here and there
(00:25:59), but it's been very healthy.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everybody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I'll start first on the $771 million of loan repurchases in the quarter. I assume that was done at par, correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'm not going to be specific on the price, but obviously if this tapers, there's probably two years left. So, it's our
loan, it's underwrite on our standards, we control the transaction. We're going to be very proactive. So I would say
approximately at that level, but give-and-take, I'm not going to be specific on the actual dollar number, but, well,
it's opportunistic. We think that there's a few more out there and we're here to accommodate. These are the loans
that we've originated. We have all the files, the data, and we will be proactive in the event the other partners are
looking to move away out of this line of business and/or decide to be more focused on C&I.
So, we...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.

So we had billions of dollars that had to go to the marketplace; and our partners, our friends out in the
marketplace are very accommodative because of our asset quality metrics. So we're very pleased to be able to
offer that in our balance sheet to get it back.

Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
High probability, we will refinance most of these loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And I think what's important about that, the way the transaction is originally structured, a lot of this retention
that we've done, we've originated it. If someone has a, let's say, pari passu at 75%, 25%, we have the 25%. We
only keep 25%. So, as we take this out, we have more potential for growth.
That was part of an ongoing thing over the past few years. We've had many players that gets refilled on
refinancing that we're actually getting the lesser of the deal because of the transaction that we struck with them on
the original sale.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Right. But what would be the yield of $771 million?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
It's probably about just under $340 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
$340 million. Okay. And are you implying...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Like I said, it's got two years life-less. It's not two years average life, two years life less.

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

They're all going to go unless you don't have it. And by the way, we don't have to replace that with pari passu
terms. Now, we decide what to do when we refinance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Right. And then the $2 billion that's remaining which you could repurchase, could you repurchase all that
tomorrow if you wanted to or there are time restrictions or other restrictions on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
There's no time restrictions. I mean, look, it is what it is. If someone was willing to – we would love to have the
opportunity to our loans back because we believe in our credit metrics. Those loans were done at a very
opportunistic time and it's still well-underwritten and below LTV. So, clearly, I'm not going to even go there as far
as the number. From time-to-time, we'll be there for the market. I don't want to give you false expectations. The
best part of the market [indiscernible] (00:28:50), so we're more than willing to accommodate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
But if the yields are not bad and the credit quality is good, why are your partners looking to divest these?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Oh, there's a number of reasons. I mean, obviously, you see many public statements made by a lot of the
competitors to diversify their balance sheet.
In C&I, they're doing other things with their business model. We are a multi-family/CRE lender. This is our
business model. We focus in the rent-regulated and rent-controlled marketplace. That's what we do. We do not –
we're not going to try and say we're commercial bank doing C&I lending. This is our core business model. So we
will be there for our customers, like I said initially from when the rent laws were changed at higher spreads.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We are far more comfortable with these assets than people that have never originated these assets. So for us,
the future period is not an unusual concern. This is going to work out very well for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. And as you guys are seeing new appraisals on multi-family loans, how much valuation is contracted post
new rent regulation all the way of six months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So, I would comment there hasn't been a lot of deals that have been done, but you've probably read this –
the same publication that we've all reviewed. A lot of the information is not correct because they don't take the full
picture of the transaction. As most of the deals have a commercial use component to the total rent roll as well as
15

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
the rent control aspect, but the cap rates that have come in are not near what the fear was when the rent laws
were put in place. So, we're still seeing low-5s to mid-5s versus high-4s in certain markets.
Like I said, you have to look at each market, each street, each area differently, each borough – Bronx versus
Manhattan, certain pockets of Manhattan versus other pockets of Manhattan, the diversity of the income stream.
So, cap rates have held in very well. You can – if you want to do some statistical analysis maybe a quarter with 25
to 30 basis points moving in the cap rate, which is not near what the fear was initially. Some of the publications
that put these numbers that made no sense, down 40%, it's not reality. They've literally carved out the commercial
use space of the income stream. When you add that back, it's not a unreasonable decline on value adjustment
because of the – really they're driven off the hurdle rate of return.
This is not – when you think about the business model, some of them put their capital up and they'll be financing
behind it. If they can get high-single digit, it's attractive if you're a long-term property owner and you have
thousands of units that you manage and you're willing to put your money up at a high-single-digit return. That
return when it was at its peak was zero because they were improving units constantly. So the fact that you
became high-single digits, there is a market for that. When you put I/O features into it, it comes out to the mid-
teens. So I mean on amortization, you're probably looking at high-single; with I/O, it's mid-teens.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
But it's really important to recognize the change that has occurred has impacted future values. We never lend on
future values. We lend on existing values. So our portfolio has not had any adverse effect of the change and our
prospective opportunity is going to be based upon whatever the numbers may be when, in fact, we're projecting
the value of the asset.
That is going to be consistent with our past practice. We've never used the future value and, therefore, the trade
in the real estate 6 months from now, 12 months from now is not going to impact one iota our ability to lend
because we lend on the existing values that are in the portfolio that actually do exist in that particular building.
There is no concern that we have that our assets are going to start non-performing because we over-lend. Many,
many, many, many people in the market, and everybody knows this: if you're lending more dollars than we're
lending, you're lending on a value other than the existing cash flow. We only lend on the existing cash flow. So,
even though this change has occurred and the prospective value will be less. It doesn't threaten our ability to be
repaid.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And Steve, and I will just add one additional commentary that it's very encouraging to see large transactions hit
the marketplace and being financed. Some of them we're financing, others are financing it, but the reality is there
are people stepping up looking at the long-term and getting a reasonable rate of return on their money and willing
to be in this business. And a lot of the nuances between how they manage these units now are going to be
somewhat different.
They're looking for loopholes based on the rent rate changes. In particular, they'll leave units vacant and try to join
the unit next door. That's something that some of the wealthier players can do because they have capacity and
they have network to do so. So, I think you're seeing a lot of that and there's probably less units hitting the
marketplace than ever before because of these changes which, unfortunately, will be negative for the city but
these large players will continue to transact.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. And Joe, if I could change directions, just ask you one final question, so we saw another MOE announced
earlier in the week and you've talked about wanting to do a deal for a while now. Do you feel any sense of
urgency to try to and get something announced and done before the – [ph] release/approved (00:34:05) before
the presidential election?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No, I don't feel any urgency to do that. But I would suggest that we are at actively in discussions in the
marketplace with a variety of people to accomplish the goals that we have articulated. Over the course of our
entire public life, we've made it very clear that we have the ability and have the desire to grow by acquisition and
create value for shareholders. So there is going to be a transaction on the horizon that will be exactly in-line with
the kinds of things that we've done in the past. So I would openly suggest to you that we are in active discussions
to do transactions because that's what we do.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I kind of – I hate to go on a limb, not go specifically, but I gave you the expense guide up $10 million based
on normalized $19 million. Obviously, prepay does play a factor, so I'm not giving you any guidance on prepaid,
but we should have a relatively healthy prepayment world in 2020 given the duration of the portfolio. At the same
time, I think that we have the NII going up every quarter. So we should see improvements on the overall efficiency
ratio.
Our goal would be to bring it in the low-40s, but hopefully, mid-to-low 40s is kind of our target. It's going to take a
few positive changes in the marketplace to make that happen. But it's not unreasonable given the fact that we're
in a cost containment mode for so many years and now we're growing the balance sheet and our NII is now
moving in the right direction.
We had a compressed NII for many, many years. So, this inflection point should bode well for the other attribute
of the calculation on the efficiency ratio. So, this should help us improve the ratio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And I was just looking at securities to assets. That's been in a pretty consistent range last couple of
quarters at 11%. I'm just wondering if you're thinking about growing the securities portfolio, because I think you'd
like to get it at some point to the high-teens, if I'm not mistaken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, I think it's fair to say that, Pete, but at the end of the day, you look where the spreads are right now. We've
had a lot of debentures paid off over the past 6 to 12 months. Cash flows are flying into the bank as far as
structured mortgage paper. So we were a very large [ph] debt player (00:36:46) and that stuff has been very nice
as far as the overall yields to the bank.
But, at the end of the day, the yields have come down materially. So we're going to allocate our resources to the
loan book in the event the market changes and we start seeing a slope [indiscernible] (00:37:01) highest slope in
the curve. We'll get to that level. It's going to take some time in this market because given where the interest rates
are. But if we go back to a healthier curve, we'll be more proactive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
And then my last question, just can you talk about what your expectations are for deposit growth in 2020 and how
you think about the balance between deposit growth and the use of wholesale borrowings?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I mean, we're going to be obviously in the market for deposits. The goal is to commensurate with asset growth. If
you look back for the full year 2019, we grew deposits almost as consistent with our asset growth. We had a little
bit more wholesale towards the end of the fourth quarter because of the fact that we shifted a lot of the higher cost
relationships out of the bank in Q3. But when you look at overall absolute deposit growth, we had a good year
deposit growth in 2019. That's the plan for 2020 is commensurate with asset growth and we'll readjust depending
on market conditions.

If the Fed cuts substantially, we may alter that. But, right now, short-term money is expensive compared to if you
look at the belly of the curve been pushing it out a few years, like I said previously, we locked in solid funding at
the low, let's say, 1.50%, 1.47% and 1.50% versus short-term rates that are out there at high-1s, so it's attractive.
Both sides are attractive given that we're liability-sensitive. But the more attractive aspect is the refinancing of our
current liabilities.

Thanks, good morning. Tom and Joe, the success you've had on the specialty finance the past year and the
pipeline looks really strong. Could you remind us the differences in yield on that portfolio and then the types of
things that you do and also types of things that you avoid in specialty finance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, as we've talked about it, our team has done a phenomenal job and we're very pleased of their production. We
believe they're going to have another strong 2020 and we support that. The team members have done and an
incredible job focusing on asset quality. No late pays. No delinquencies. No defaults. No real credit hiccups to
speak of and very well-diverse book. The book is broken out between three categories: asset-backed loans,
equipment financing, and dealer floor-planning. Asset-backed is around $700 million outstanding with 25
percentage of total outstandings compared to the total dollar amount of $2.8 billion. Equipment is about $1.3
billion, that's 48% of the total and deal floor-planning which has been very attractive in this environment at $775
million, which is 27%.
The yield on the papers is slightly higher than our multi-family yield when you take in the account fees and that we
amortize to the yield. It's about 3.66%. We're going to be active. I think what's most important is that what we see
is we turn down most of what we see. So we're effectively doing about a 10% hit rate on 100% of what we see.
So, 90% is what we don't do. Not because it's credit. It could be yield. It could be various reasons. Our board may
not be happy with the various counterparties. But at the end of the day, we typically have been turning down 90%
of what we see. We've growing the book around 25% on a CAGR basis.

So we're very pleased to allocate capital there. Like I've said in many previous conference calls, it doesn't come
with the positive relationships. We're not intrusive to the lead bank but we're a credit buy-up shop. And so we're
going to be very – we'll be a good partner for some of the largest players but we're not booking into the positive
relationship. That's the down – that's one of the negative aspects of the business. We're not bringing in the
funding for this type of business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. Great. That's really helpful. Thanks for going through that. And then speaking of deposits, it seemed that
the core deposits ex-CDs had a solid quarter and was stronger than the total. What do you see for this year? I
know it's still a challenging environment but what's sort of in your deposit pipeline?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No, we think that it's going to be continuing similar to the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter. Rates go
dramatically lower than they were a year ago when the Fed was in a tightening mode, right? So, our highest
offering rate is in the three-month category. We'll bring the highest cost money into the short-end of the curve, so
three months at 1.65% and I think customers are looking at that as a viable alternative in going out to a year or
longer given where rates are.
Our one-year offering on a liquid CD is about 1.5%. So we're clearly enticing customers to go into the shorter
duration. Our nine-month money is at 1.85%. You've seen that. Yeah. So customers are keeping inside of one
year, it has been consistent for the past decade and we think that if the Fed happens to reduce rates, we'll benefit
further. In the meantime, if the Fed stays flat for the year, there should be very well-planned for 2020 to take
advantage of those higher costs CDs coming throughout the year which I've mentioned in the previous
commentary.

Again, we don't envision it as having a material impact to our company given that we're a real estate lender and
our duration is very, very short compared to other types of loans. If you look at our average life at 2.1 years for the
book, it's very short. Albeit macroeconomic changes to the environment, it's hard to predict what could happen
two, three years from now. But we are a multi-family lender that has a relatively short duration book and should
not have a material impact going forward. The capital is probably between 3 to 6 basis points upfront and not
material.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then sticking with the capital question. Over the last year, year-and-a-half, we've seen capital is measured by
tangible common equity grind slowly, lower. Given the kind of growth outlook you're talking about, the NIM
expansion, how comfortable are you with taking capital levels potentially lower and do you see any need to adjust
the dividend or potentially, down the road, raise any sort of common equity?

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'm not even going to go to the dividend question at this stage of the game. We've been doing this for quite some
time. Obviously, commensurate with the NII growth, margin expansion also comes the EPS growth. So, like I said
in the previous quarters, it's inconceivable to say we should have double-digit EPS growth which is reasonable
and that's conservative. So I think that we're in a positive [indiscernible] (00:43:56) in respect to build some capital
for the first time in a while as our earnings improve with this dynamic of the margin and the NII expanding. So I
think we're encouraged by that.
We're very comfortable with our capital position. We have no losses. We have a history of no losses. We have a
history of having the best asset quality in the country. So, as far as you want to allocate capital to a business that
has zero losses, we have very little allocation towards the impact of provisioning for high-quality, low-leverage
lending. So we're very comfortable about capital position, our dividend is solid and we've always been standing by
our dividend and that's been the hallmark of the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then going back to your mid-single digit loan growth comment, the pipeline is down 30% quarter-over-
quarter. Just want to get a sense for how much of the growth you anticipate being from organic versus repurchase
activity, if you could give us a breakdown?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I won't even budget repurchase activity. I'd go organic. We are laser-focused to increase our retention rate
which we will do in 2020. And more importantly, if you look at the – we had $3 billion business in the fourth
quarter. Q1 is down on seasonality. It's a seasonality quarter. So we're very excited about what's ahead of us. Our
guys are extremely busy. The pipeline that we announced is the committed pipeline. The pipeline that we have is
much higher because the loans are coming in and we're laser-focused on managing that retention rate, managing
that $6 billion, $7 billion of business coming due in the next two years. We have the files, we have the data. We
will make sure that we get first crack at our customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. And then just last one for me is we get to see the press releases, we don't see behind the scenes
what's going on with LTVs and reappraisals like you do on the multi-family side. And so I was hoping you could
just walk us through where there have been reappraisals, where there have been valuations that have come in
lower? Have you seen any LTVs that have tripped over 80%. If they do, what is borrower behavior? Are people
willing and actively bringing cash to the table to maintain low LTVs? Just some sense and comfort around
borrower behaviors in light of lower valuations?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So I'm not going to sound cavalier about this, but at the end of the day, we're a low-leverage lender. We don't see
these types of numbers that they're concerned about at today's environment. With two quarters past the rent
control laws that would be in effect, it's going to take some time to see what these impacts are in other parts of the
borrowers.

But at the end of the day, if you're a low-leverage lender and buyers and sellers are coming together and then
putting a hurdle rate of return that people can agree with, there'll be transactions. We'll finance it based on a very
conservative policy and we lose loans. We're losing because other banks are being aggressive. We play against
the government, we play against a lot of large banks but we are very targeted towards super-conservative
underwriting.
So what we're seeing right now and you'll see a lot of information in the current trade publications about deals that
get done. We're not doing all those deals because it doesn't make sense for our balance sheet. But you may have
to extend a little bit longer in this environment because property owners may want an extra couple of years so the
5-year may go to 7, maybe some 10-year money. You may try to tweak some I/O structure from a no I/O to
maybe a 2, 3-year I/O but you'll be competitive, but it all comes down to that we're not going to lose deals
because of rate. We will lose deals because of dollar amount and that's always been the hallmark of the
company.
So when times are difficult, there'll be activity. Buyers will come in and buy opportunity then we'll finance that
opportunity. So we're not there yet. The good news is that some of the non-traditional players that are equity
financiers or bridge financiers are getting diluted on their deal, it's because they're not working but that's not our
book. So that's positive because you're not seeing the losses yet. There's a handful of customers that are in a –
not all customers, a handful of customers that are in the Fannie Mae structure or the Freddie Mac structure that
are coming through with some difficulties and when it goes to the special servicer, gets put out to sale, someone
will buy that at a hurdle rate of return that works for them. And if the numbers works for us, we'll finance it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And I'm just probably missing one of the points: Cap rates are not moving aggressively. Cap rates are holding
very nicely, interest rates are relatively low compared to last year, so you still have a very low cap rate and you
have a low interest rate environment. So business is relatively strong because of that.

Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
So, just getting back to the competitive environment, can you give us some color to what you're seeing today
versus what you saw last quarter in terms of the GSEs and other non-banks and what are the factors driving
those differences?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I would say – it's Tom. I would say that the GSE is very real, they're very large and it could be always a
welcome player and the best players will be very active and I/O is a very attractive alternative for customers who
want to bring their payments lower and try to drive higher returns to them in potentially over a 10-year period.
We've been very proactive on trying to avoid that type of model. When we structure I/O, we tend to be a hybrid I/O
player in maybe one-, two-, three-year type of I/O. But if you have a solid low-leverage transaction with a very
good long-term customer, you may have to play in that landscape.
Well, the best scenario for us as rates go up in the back end, the agencies are less relevant. So, right now they're
relevant but we'll compete. And, I'd say, that the government has the biggest acts for the transactions in the
marketplace. And at the same time, like I said, we're going to be very active on managing that book that's coming
due and making sure that we get first crack at all of our customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q

Appreciate that. And then just last question. You're non-interest bearing deposits had a nice uptick in the quarter,
can you just give some color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I would say this, again, seasonality [indiscernible] (00:50:12) at year-end. I wouldn't think – it's not a targeted plan.
This is – we're running a very large deposit but we do have some seasonality there.

Collyn, how are you?

Good. Good morning, gentlemen. I didn't think I was going to get on here. Okay.

[indiscernible] (00:50:36), Collyn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Just first on the funding side. So, Tom, I appreciate some of the rates you're offering – that you're putting out
there on the CD market now. It seems like some of those CD rates are probably below market or sort of at-
market. I mean you still have confidence in your ability to grow the deposit book even if you're below market rates
on CDs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We're a large institution. We have a lot of branches in different markets. Like I said, we do offer a hybrid elite
customer base maybe a few basis points of customers who are going to analyze us for 5 or 6 basis points to
retain it. But, at the end of the day, we've been very competitive there. We're not in a massive growth campaign
right now. If we are going to go to a growth campaign, if the market does change and the 5% becomes 10%
growth on the loan side, then we'll go into a growth campaign mode.
But, to be in the market, we're, like you said, in the middle of the range and, I think, slightly south of 2% on
average is where the overall market is. And I think, by the way, the market is too high if you look at where
treasuries are trading right now. I think a lot of liquidity was put in place year-end because of the balance sheet
requirements. Some of the larger money center banks were pushing their balance sheet requirements. But even if
you think about where the rates are right now and rates have come down quite a bit, we're at 1.85% for nine
months. It's a reasonable rate, probably too high, and if the Fed cuts rates, will lower.
But in the meantime, our model has no Fed changes. We assume the Fed is on hold for the year. And we're in a
unique spot to benefit from a liability-sensitive balance sheet and see some good NOI growth from that.

Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We can adjust that very quickly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just – so, Tom, you had indicated deposit growth commensurate with loan growth.
How about if you do see more opportunistic loan purchases, how do you intend to fund those?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We will look at both the wholesale markets as well as the deposit markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Like I said before, the wholesale markets, if structured properly, is very attractive right now. There is somewhat of
a uniqueness in the return. And when we look at the belly of the curve and the short-end of the curve, short-term
financing is expensive compared to doing a three- or four-year lockout with putting a swap on. So we've been
doing that from time to time. The basis risk is low. We think it's a reasonable execution and we've been very
proactive there, both from time to time depending on the marketplace. But we're putting money on 1.50% right
now versus 1.90% on CDs. So there's definitely a reasonable delta to move towards wholesale.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And just also to your point, right, so retention is going to be so key to sort of the loan
growth outlook. Just a couple of questions on that. So you had indicated and, I think this is the first time you guys
put it in the press release, that the pipeline had 66% new money this quarter. Do you have what that percentage
was from last quarter's pipeline?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, I would say and I think we've always put it in – maybe look back, I remember, various press release, we
always kind of tell the overall new money pipeline. New money has been around two-thirds. It's been pretty
consistent. I think what's interesting is that you know when you have certain deals that are going to go for good
reason. We have some customers that finance themselves rather than going to the bank because of mortgage
transfer tax. They didn't have to deal with the expense of doing a transaction in New York, so they used their
credit facility which was cheaper than getting money from the bank. That happens from time to time.
So, we take advantage of those one-offs and try to carve out what happened in the quarter. I think our retention
has improved slightly, but we have a long way to go. I like to have that retention rate going back towards the
26


New York Community Bancorp, Inc.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
normality, which was significantly higher than we were in the previous six months. So you saw a drop-off when
the rent control laws were put in place. We had a lot of volatility in Q3. Q4, we had good stabilization, the healthy
yield curve in Q4, very attractive buying and selling. It wasn't a blockbuster quarter as far as transaction, but there
were some transactions and things are getting done. So I like the fact that there's a predictable Fed right now,
more or less, for the year. And I think that customers are realizing that a lot of money has to be dealt with in the
next two years, so they have to finance. And with that, we're open for business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And then, so just kind of along the lines of the $3.3 billion of originations, net growth, putting the
purchase aside was $280 million. So, just trying to sort of – I mean, obviously, better understand bridging that
gap. And I think when you talk about the outlook for prepays and not dynamic in 2020, I guess I'm – if they're
contractually maturing – if the numbers you've laid out are contractually maturing this year, why would they
prepay? I wouldn't think they would prepay, right? So wouldn't prepay income be significantly less?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, like I said, depending on what bucket comes due, it's very important. We know that, in 2020, if they wait the
last second, they're not going to pay 8% on their financing, right? They'll pay the market. Let's say the market is
3.5%. So you have a 3.18% going to 3.5%. Still good for the bank. Yes, you don't get a prepayment because
they're rolling it to the next financing, but those loans have no choice but to come due.
The ones that are in 2021, 2022 is where the opportunity will arise. If they decide to lock-in for the next seven
years instead of five, they may choose to do so based on their own internal decisions, based on financing their
entire portfolio of loans. We're going to be very active on working with our customers to get into the table sooner.
We do that all the time.
But, in this particular case, our goal is to maintain higher retention, so we know what's coming due. We know
what's coming due for the next five years. But, for the next two years, there's an opportunity to take those lower
yielding loans and not put them in a position to go to a much higher rate because no one knows where rates are
going to be a year from now. They may opt to finance today. And so we could be proactive with the portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, the reality is that our goal is to get back to historical levels, which is well above 50%, okay? We're not there
yet. Q3 was probably the worst you've seen. We bumped it up by 10% when you carve out certain loans that we
knew were going and/or we're not willing to finance. I mentioned one, in particular, because it was a large loan of
$100 million that used their credit facility to finance themselves. And you take those one-offs, we probably
improved our retention rate by 10%. So 34% becomes 44%. We need to be well over 50% and moving towards
50% in 2020. That's the goal.

Hey, Brock.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for – hey. I know you talked about the Day 1 CECL impact. We've heard a lot of banks kind of walking up
net charge-offs guides for a variety of reasons. How should we think about 2020 as far as net charge-offs, is this
still a 5-basis point kind of a number or should we be thinking something more given the shift into specialty
finance or what have you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No, Brock. So, Brock, what I would say is if you carve-out the medallion, zero is probably a number for us. It's
really the history. You know the history of the company, our credit quality. Medallion has been most of the
charges we've taken over the past few years. The good news there is there are some major players circling to
look at acquiring most of those assets in the marketplace, so it sounds like we're getting close to the bottom there.
You can never predict where the bottom is. When you take out medallion losses, we don't have any losses.
As far specialty finance, it's been a – we haven't seen a 30-day ever, so I think we're in a very good spot. I
wouldn't work too hard in understanding our difference between a credit card lending because this is what we do.

We're a rent-regulated, multi-family/CRE lender with a history of no losses. I think our CRE book is half the losses
we've had in multi-family which is de minimis.
So, yes, the accounting laws do change. We're going to take a fund change in the provision because we have to,
to right-size the one-time adjustment. The capital impact of that is between 3 to 6 basis points. But after that, it's
business as usual. And unless there's a change in the marketplace and the duration goes from 2 years to 10
years, I don't envision any real material changes for us.
