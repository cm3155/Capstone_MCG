Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Kristie. Good evening and thank you for joining us today. Before I discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal
year earnings, I want to start by acknowledging the heartbreaking devastation our associates, advisors, friends
and neighbors experienced over the last several weeks. With hurricanes Helene and Milton impacting
communities throughout the Southeast, including the St. Petersburg, Tampa Bay area where Raymond James is
headquartered, as well as the Carolinas and Georgias, thousands across the region experienced unprecedented
flooding, power outages, property damage and devastation.
We enacted our business continuity plans and with our service workforce almost equally distributed across offices
in Saint Pete, Memphis and Southfield, Michigan, colleagues outside impacted areas stepped in to ensure
continuous service coverage. Even those affected associates and advisors continued to serve clients while facing
storm and evacuations, often working remotely from safe locations. The storm left a long recovery road ahead of
us for all in their path. And while it's been difficult to bear witness to the pain and loss, I have also been humbled
by the resilience of our associates, advisors and our community.
Following the hurricane, the firm and leadership team have contributed almost $11 million to associate and
community relief, including stipends to eligible associates and donations to Friends of Raymond James, the
American Red Cross, the United Way Suncoast and other charitable organizations across impacted communities.
In addition to granting associates the time needed to navigate recovery efforts, the firm continues to provide

comprehensive resources and benefits, including information about financial support, immediate aid, relocation
services and wellness benefits. Challenging times like these highlight the importance of always putting people
first, which has always been the foundation of Raymond James. The preparation, perseverance and response to
the storm reflect the long history of Raymond James' service culture, and I'm especially proud to represent our
team today.
Now, moving to our quarterly performance, we achieved strong results once again, concluding another fiscal year
with outstanding achievements. In fiscal 2024, we generated record net revenues and record net income,
showcasing the strength of our diverse and complementary businesses. We ended the year with record client
assets, healthy pipelines for growth across our business and ample funding to support the balance sheet. We
remain well positioned to continue to invest in our business, our people and technology to help drive growth
across all of our businesses.
Beginning on slide 4, the firm reported record fiscal fourth quarter net revenues of $3.46 billion, net income
available to common shareholders of $601 million and earnings per diluted share of $2.86. Excluding expenses
related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $621 million or $2.95 per
diluted share. We generated strong returns for the quarter with annualized return on common equity of 21.2% and
annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 25.8%. A great result, particularly given our strong
capital base.
During the fiscal quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock for $300 million, bringing our fiscal
year total to 7.7 million shares for $900 million at an average price of $117 per share. In total, we returned nearly
$1.3 billion of capital to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends in the fiscal year.
Moving to slide 5, client assets grew to record levels this quarter, driven by rising equity markets and solid advisor
retention and recruiting in the Private Client Group. Total assets under administration increased 6% sequentially
to $1.57 trillion. Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts grew to $875 billion and financial assets
under management to $245 billion. Domestic net new assets during the quarter were $13 billion, representing a
4% annualized growth rate on beginning of the period domestic PCG assets. And for the fiscal year, domestic net
new assets were $60.7 billion, representing a 5.5% growth rate on beginning of the period domestic Private Client
Group assets.
A key contributor to the net new asset growth is our continued recruiting results, which were really strong this
quarter. To our domestic independent contractor and employee channels, we recruited financial advisors with
approximately $100 million of trailing 12-month production and $17.5 billion of client assets at their previous firms.
Including assets recruited into our growing RIA & Custody
Services division, which we refer to as RCS, we recruited across all platforms total client assets during the quarter
of $22.3 billion, surpassing the previous best quarter, which occurred in 2021 in terms of recruited assets.
For the fiscal year, we recruited financial advisors with approximately $335 million of trailing 12-month production
and $56.7 billion of client assets at the previous firms. Recruiting in the year production and assets equaled to
that of a pretty good-sized firm. RCS asset growth is bolstered by both external joins as well as from internal
transfers, and RCS finished the quarter with $181 billion of client assets under administration, up 36% over the
prior year level. This quarter, we reported financial advisers of 8,787.
Overall, these fantastic recruiting results reflect the continuous focus of the entire firm to ensure Raymond James
remains a destination of choice for advisors. As we had mentioned in previous quarters, there are a couple of

OSJ relationships in our Independent Contractor Division who had decided to leave the platform. It takes time to
affect these movements, but a portion of those assets left the firm in the fiscal fourth quarter, totaling roughly $3
billion of AUA. We anticipate approximately $5 billion of assets associated with these firms to complete their
transfers off the platform in early fiscal 2025.
Adjusting for these transferred assets, net new assets growth in the quarter would have been approximately 5%.
Overall, we remain focused on serving advisors across our multiple affiliation options. Our robust technology
capabilities and client-first values continue to enable us to retain and attract high-quality advisors.
Total client domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at $57.9 billion, up
3% over June of 2024. Bank loans grew at 2% over the preceding quarter to a record $46 billion, primarily due to
higher securities-based loans, which grew 5% in the quarter, as well as continued residential mortgage growth.
Moving to slide 6, Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of $2.48 billion and pre-tax
income of $461 million. Year-over-year, results were bolstered by higher PCG assets under administration due to
a strong equity market and net new assets brought into the firm.
Reflecting positive results from our long-term focus and patience to hold the course in our Capital Markets
businesses generated quarterly net revenues of $483 million and a pre-tax income of $95 million. Net revenues
grew 42% year-over-year and 46% sequentially, driven primarily by higher M&A revenues as the market
environment became more supportive of transaction closings in the quarter. Market conditions seem to be
improving, and we are optimistic about our healthy pipeline and new business activity in M&A.
The Asset Management segment generated record pre-tax income of $116 million on record net revenues of
$275 million. Results were largely attributable to higher financial assets under management compared to the prior
year quarter due to market appreciation and net inflows in PCG fee-based accounts, as well as modest net
inflows into Raymond James Investment Management.
The Bank segment generated net revenues of $433 million and pre-tax income of $98 million. Bank segment net
interest income increased 1% due in part to higher loan balances. The net interest margin for the segment of
2.62% declined 2 basis points compared to the preceding quarter.
Looking at the fiscal year 2024 results on slide 7, we generated record net revenues of $12.82 billion and record
net income available to common shareholders of $2.06 billion, up 10% and 19%, respectively, over the record set
in the prior year. Additionally, we generated strong returns on common equity of 18.9% and adjusted return on
tangible common equity of 23.3% for the year.
On slide 8, the record results in PCG and Asset Management segments for the fiscal year primarily reflected a
strong organic growth in PCG, along with robust equity markets.
Now, I'll turn the call over to our new CFO, Butch Oorlog, to review our financial results in detail. Butch?

Thank you, Paul. Turning to slide 10, consolidated net revenues were a record $3.46 billion in the fourth quarter,
up 13% over the prior year and up 7% sequentially. Asset management and related administrative fees grew to
$1.66 billion, representing 15% growth over the prior year and 3% over the preceding quarter. This quarter, PCG
domestic fee-based assets increased 7%, which will be an approximate 6% tailwind for asset management and
5

related administrative fees in the fiscal first quarter. Brokerage revenues of $561 million grew 17% year-over-year,
primarily due to higher brokerage revenues in PCG and Fixed Income Capital Markets. I'll discuss account and
service fees and net interest income shortly. Investment banking revenues of $315 million increased 56% year-
over-year and 72% sequentially. Fourth quarter results benefited from a significant increase in M&A revenues.
Moving to slide 11, client domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at
$57.9 billion, up 3% compared to the preceding quarter, and representing 4.2% of domestic PCG client assets. So
far in the fiscal first quarter, domestic cash sweep balances have declined about $1.3 billion attributable to record
quarterly fee billings.
Turning to slide 12, combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks were $678 million, up
1% over the preceding quarter. The Bank segment net interest margin was down 2 basis points to 2.62% for the
quarter, while the average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks decreased 7 basis points to 3.34%,
primarily due to the Fed rate cut.
Based on current rates and balances, which reflects the September rate cut and the impact of quarterly fee
billings, we would expect the aggregate of NII and RJBDP third-party fees to be down approximately 5% in the
fiscal first quarter. Keep in mind, there are a lot of variables that could impact that estimate, including further rate
actions which are not assumed.
Turning to consolidated expenses on slide 13. Compensation expense was $2.16 billion, and the total
compensation ratio for the quarter was 62.4%. Excluding acquisition-related compensation expenses, the
adjusted compensation ratio was 62.1%. Non-compensation expenses of $543 million increased 10%
sequentially, largely due to the bank loan provision for credit losses, which was a benefit in the preceding quarter.
For the fiscal year, non-compensation expenses, excluding the bank loan provision for credit losses, unexpected
legal and regulatory items and non-GAAP adjustments presented in our non-GAAP financial measures came in
just under our expectation of $1.9 billion. While we maintain discipline in controlling our expenses, we continue to
invest to support growth across the business.
Slide 14 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. This quarter, we generated a pre-tax margin
of 22%, an adjusted pre-tax margin of 22.7%, an increase over the prior quarter arising in part from the improved
Capital Markets results.
On slide 15, at quarter end, our total assets were $83 billion, a 3% sequential increase, largely due to loan growth
and higher cash balances, primarily held in our Bank segment. Liquidity and capital each remained very strong.
RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $2.2 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target. With a Tier 1
leverage ratio of 12.8% and total capital ratio of 24.1%, we remain well capitalized. Our capital levels provide
significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth. The effective tax rate was 20.8% for the
quarter, primarily reflecting the favorable impact of non-taxable valuation gains associated with the corporate
owned life insurance portfolio.
Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. During the quarter, the firm
repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock for $300 million at an average price of $115 per share. For the
fiscal year, we repurchased 7.7 million shares for $900 million. As Paul noted earlier, in total, we returned capital
to shareholders of approximately $1.3 billion during the fiscal year through dividends and share repurchases.
As of October 19, approximately $645 million remained under the board's approved common stock repurchase
authorization. Going forward, we expect to continue to offset share-based compensation dilution and to be
6

opportunistic with incremental share repurchases. Given our present capital and liquidity levels, we currently
expect to keep a similar pace of buyback activity, as we did during this quarter, or possibly more as we remain
committed to maintaining capital levels in line with our stated targets.
Lastly, on slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank
and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio remains solid. Non-performing assets remained
low and relatively unchanged from the prior quarter level at 28 basis points of bank assets. Criticized loans as a
percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.47%, up from 1.15% in the preceding quarter,
primarily due to a small number of idiosyncratic loan downgrades.
The bank allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter roughly
unchanged from the prior quarter level at just under 1%. The allowance percentage has trended lower, largely
due to a loan mix shift toward more securities-based loans and residential mortgages, which carry lower
allowance levels and now account for 35% and 20% of the total loan portfolio balances respectively. The bank
loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percent of corporate loans held for investment was
largely unchanged from the preceding quarter at approximately 2% at quarter end. We believe this represents an
appropriate reserve, but we continue to closely monitor economic factors that may impact our loan portfolios.
Now I'll turn the call over to Paul Shoukry to discuss our outlook. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry
President & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Butch. You definitely covered the financials a lot better than I did when I was the CFO. Great job. Now
on to our outlook.
We are pleased with our record results this quarter and for the fiscal year. More importantly, we are well
positioned entering fiscal 2025 with record client asset levels, healthy pipelines for growth across the business,
and ample capital and funding to support balance sheet growth.
In the Private Client Group, next quarter's results will be positively impacted by the sequential increase of assets
and fee-based accounts, which we expect will benefit asset management and related fees by approximately 6%.
Our advisor recruiting activity remains robust and we're encouraged by the number of large teams joining us and
remaining in the pipeline. We are focused on being a destination of choice for current and prospective advisors,
which we believe over the long term should continue to drive industry-leading growth.
In the Capital Markets segment, we were pleased to see significantly improved results this quarter as the market
environment became more constructive for investment banking results and particularly M&A. Our M&A pipeline
remains healthy and we are optimistic that the consistent investments in our platform and people should continue
to drive growth in fiscal 2025. And in the Fixed Income business, the market is still challenging, but we've begun
to see some improvement in the depository sector of our business. With short-term rates decreasing and the yield
curve steepening, depository clients are starting to be more engaged in managing their securities portfolio.
Overall, despite the headwinds over the past two years, we believe our long-term, patient approach, along with
opportunistic investments we've made, have well positioned us for growth as the market and rate environment
become more conducive for the Capital Markets segment.
In the Asset Management segment, we remain confident that strong growth of assets and fee-based accounts in
the Private Client Group will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management. In addition, we expect
7

Raymond James Investment Management to help drive further growth over time. And while the entire industry has
been challenged by high levels of redemption activity, the record levels of sales in fiscal 2024 are a testament to
our strong portfolio management and sales teams.
In the Bank segment, we remain focused on fortifying the balance sheet with diversified funding sources and
prudently growing assets to support client demand. We have seen securities-based loan demand increase as
clients get comfortable with the current level of rates, further supported by the recent Fed rate cut. Corporate loan
growth has been muted as new origination activity in the credits we target remain low. But we will remain patient
and we are confident that loan demand in this category will rebound as well. With ample client cash balances and
capital, we are very well positioned to lend across the loan segments as activity increases within our conservative
risk guidelines.
In addition to driving organic growth across our businesses, we also remain focused on corporate development
efforts. While we prefer to deploy capital to invest in growth, we plan to maintain this past quarter's pace of
buybacks or potentially increase it as we continue to look for opportunities that may meet our disciplined M&A
parameters.
I want to quickly touch on short-term rates because all too often lower interest rates are viewed as a negative for
our business. I would just say that there are a lot of potential positive outcomes as well. Two potential examples
are higher loan growth and better investment banking results across the industry, both which have been really low
over the past couple of years. Again, this reinforces the value of having diversified and complementary
businesses.
In closing, we are well positioned entering fiscal 2025 with strong competitive positioning in all of our businesses
and solid capital and liquidity to invest in future growth. I want to thank our advisors and associates for their
continued dedication to providing excellent service to their clients. I also want to thank our fantastic leadership
team, many who took on larger roles starting on October 1 as part of our long-term CEO succession process. I
really look forward to partnering even more closely with all of our leaders and associates for many years to come.
And of course, I want to thank Paul Reilly for developing this strong team over the past 15 years.
What is reinforced in the most challenging of times, including with the two 100-year hurricanes that hit us in a two-
week period, is that we have something really special here at Raymond James. And my number one job when I
take over as CEO is to do everything we possibly can to fiercely protect our culture and values.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, will you please open the line for questions?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first
question comes from the line of Michael Cho with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Y. Cho Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good evening, team. Thanks for taking my question. My first question, I just wanted to touch on the Capital
Markets segment here. I apologize in advance of – it's a two-parter, but clearly a nice pick-up, as you noted, in the
advisory segment. Can you give any color or anything incremental in terms of maybe what you saw in the quarter
or what – and if there's anything particularly that drove the quarterly results in advisory and maybe anything more
on the pipeline as you look ahead as well?
And then secondly, Paul, as you've kind of talked through, you invested in people and platform in this business
over the last number of years. And so when we think about operating leverage ahead, I mean, is there a way to
frame the incremental margins ahead, maybe relative to maybe what you've achieved in prior environments of
better capital markets activity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, first, I think the whole market has pretty much shown an improving M&A environment, and I think it's rate
expectation and frankly, a lot of capital on the sidelines. So we had a big pick-up this quarter, but we're seeing
that both in activity in this current quarter coming up. So a lot of bigger transactions, a lot of people who've been
on the sidelines that have reached deals to close them. So in terms of activity, we can – we could go by number
of MDs. We'd have to speculate what the number – what the rate is. Certainly, I think we've had a year a couple
of years ago that's hard to beat the benchmark because of this exceptional year. But we've got room to grow from
here. And I wouldn't really put a number on it yet, but we've got a lot of productive capacity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Y. Cho Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. As far as the margin goes, the margin portion of your question, for the year is 20.6%, and that's a pretty
healthy margin, given the mix of businesses that we're in. Now Capital Markets really wasn't hitting on all
cylinders until this past quarter's final quarter of the fiscal year. But as – we have puts and takes in our
businesses. So I'd say over time, our goal has always been to grow revenues faster than expenses and therefore
grow earnings and margins beyond that. But in any one quarter, any one year, there could be a lot of puts and
takes in our various businesses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Y. Cho Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, wonderful. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on the balance sheet. I know you had a willingness
for – there is a willingness just to ultimately grow the balance sheet, and you've called out that corporate loan

growth particularly has been somewhat tepid. Just curious what you're hearing from clients and what ultimately
drives more demand here, if it's really just simply lower rates, or if you're hearing anything else in terms of that
piece of business. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. On the corporate side, lower rates would certainly help as companies take advantage of the debt that they
could get at more attractive rates. But also, going back to your last question to Paul, M&A activity historically has
been a big driver of financing needs. And so, as we start seeing M&A activity pick up, hopefully that will be a
leading indicator for corporate loan demand over time.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious on your outlook for next year with the non-comp
expense. You came in slightly below the $1.9 billion for fiscal 2024. Could you talk about the areas of investment
and maybe quantify growth in that non-comp as you think about the next 12 months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
A lot of our non-comp items, as we've said in the past, is really growth-related. So, investment sub-advisory fees,
for example, that grows with fee-based assets, which have been growing really nicely, 7% sequentially as an
example. And then the other expenses, we're going to continue to invest heavily in technology.
If you look at it on a percentage basis, that's been our biggest grower consistently year-in and year-out, and on an
absolute dollar basis for that matter. And that's really to remain competitive and provide advisors the very best
technology that we can, very competitive in the industry to help them find time and serve their clients more
efficiently and effectively.
And so, technology will continue to be a area of focus. And then, of course, as you grow as an organization and
grow the businesses, you're going to need to grow the branch and office space and other aspects of non-comp to
invest in the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Understood. And then, the comments around the backlog for advisors sounded pretty similar to what we've heard
from previous quarters. I was hoping to get a little more context maybe around numbers for retention in the
period. And then, I think the larger books of business coming onboard, maybe talk about the size today that you're
recruiting, average size versus, say, a year ago.

Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think that both of those are up is that the biggest change probably over the last few years is a fewer advisors in
total, but much, much bigger book. So not only was this year an onboarding of probably the most largest books
we ever have, but also the same in the pipeline. So, we've become a destination for very large teams, I think both
because of our technology platform and our high net worth offerings over the last couple of years that we've
developed have really taken off and made us a destination. So, we're very comfortable. Not only do we have a
very good recruiting year, but we're very comfortable with the backlog that's in there too.

Hey, Devin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC
First question just on coming back to the balance sheet, just lending capacity as demand picks up here. So you
have obviously plenty of capital. You seem to be holding at least a couple billion dollars of excess liquidity on the
balance sheet. And then I think you have $18 billion of cash at third-party bank. So, appreciate this isn't going to
happen overnight and you're not going to force the lending, but how you would frame the amount of loan growth
that could come from just remixing the current balance sheet? And then how much of that third-party cash you
guys are comfortable moving on to the balance sheet over time with the assumption that deposits are stabilizing
to maybe starting to grow a bit here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, Devin, you answered the question just by giving the stats. We have a ton of cash in capital. And I think that
what's limited our growth is just we've been very consistent in our risk appetite and having low risk on the C&I
side of the portfolio, and just the spreads and the demand haven't been there. They're just – I think a lot of that
has been, as Paul talked about earlier, because of lack of M&A activity. Certainly, the opportunities to lend at the
spreads and the risk tolerances we like haven't been there. But we're more than willing, when that returns, to
invest in them. So that's holding it back there.
On the other side, the SBL loans, as rates went way up and mortgages, as rates went up, it just cooled the
appetite. Now that we've seen even after just a 50 basis point drop, we've seen a pick up on SBLs right away. I
think people have gotten used to the rates and figured they're going to be around-ish to stay and they are floating.
So if they – the SBLs, if they go down, the rates will go down and clients seem to be more active.

So, we're waiting on the commercial side to see a risk/reward in terms of spreads and the risk part we like and are
comfortable with. And on the client side, for SBLs and mortgages, it's really their appetite. We're here and ready,
and we have plenty of cash. So we're not trying to limit the bank growth. Seen over the years, we'll have quarters
where there we've had fairly sizable growth and then quarters where we've had none, just based on really what
we think that market risk appetite is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC
Yeah. Thanks, Paul. I appreciate that. I guess, where I was going was more that you have $18 billion of third-
party cash. You want to have some liquidity parameters there, I'm sure, for risk management purposes. So like,
are you comfortable moving $5 billion of that or $10 billion of that? Like what's the threshold that we should be
looking at? I know there's been thresholds over time. So just curious how you guys think about that and where
you're comfortable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I mean, the major thing that drives that is we offer clients FDIC insurance up to $3 million through the
multi-sweep program. And so we want to make sure that we avail our clients to those third-party banks to
maximize their FDIC insurance. Not a lot of other firms do that anymore, especially firms with affiliated banks. And
so, we think it's important to protect – to give that client that type of protection. And so that would limit all $18
billion, for example, to being deployed in our own bank. Probably would limit half of that, I would say, something in
that range from being deployed to our own bank to give the clients the FDIC insurance that they could get through
the multi-sweep program.

Devin Ryan Q

Got it. Okay. That's great color. Thanks, Paul. And then follow-up, I'd love to ask about fixed income brokerage. I
think performing reasonably in an environment that's been challenged. I think you guys highlighted starting to see
some light at the end of the tunnel with depository clients. So just trying to think about where we could go from
here, if there's kind of a framing of whether it's historical levels of revenue. Or how we should think about like how
maybe much that part of the business is under-punching relative to its potential, if liquidity builds in the system
and banks are more active, like just where that could go relative to where we currently are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I would say the periods during COVID with very low rates, those were kind of record levels for fixed income
brokerage. And that was a perfect environment for that business. There was lots of excess cash in the system.
There's short-term rates were close to zero and there is benefit for taking on some duration. And so somewhere
between kind of where we've been running in the last couple of years and COVID is probably a reasonable place
to kind of think a healthy level would be over time.
And then, of course, as we grow the business and we take market share and we grow tangential opportunities like
SumRidge has been a great addition beyond the depository spaces, that diversifies and further strengthens our
business as well. So we'll continue to look to add to our capabilities. And also our balance sheet is getting bigger.
So over time we'll also use our balance sheet in a very prudent way to continue supporting that business as well.

So it's still a growth business for us over time, but just from the pure depository space, the COVID period was sort
of – the components of that business were sort of perfectly aligned.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So wanted to ask about advisory. So it's one of the themes
we've been noticing and has been sort of nagging has been that sponsors have been sort of slow to re-engage.
But I know your advisory business has a lot of leverage there, and certainly encouraging to see that strength. So
hoping you could get maybe a little more color around what you're seeing. Is this a good sign that sponsors are
beginning to re-engage in the mid-market space or were there some lumpy results that benefited the revenues?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think there's a general re-engagement, so – and across a lot of sectors. So it's a sign. It's – we've always been, I
guess, pretty conservative on our outlook there. Any time we've talked, we've talked about a backlog, but the
market wasn't conducive. We're seeing people engage in. And it's not only on inventory, I mean existing things
that were up for being sold, but we're seeing new engagement and discussions about new mandates.
So we think – I'm not going to say it's going to boom overnight, but we're seeing a much more conducive market,
both in interest on buyers and sellers. So at least for the near term, we see a fairly good market and recovering
market. But I don't know if we can give you more color because one quarter doesn't always paint a long-term
trend. But we can tell you that the backlog looks pretty good for this – for the near term anyway.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. That's fair. Thanks. Thanks for that, Paul. And then ESP, given where the yields were on that product, I
would expect that in the recent Fed cut, that had a very high beta. Should we just assume that that's a roughly
100-beta product as we see cuts? And have you noticed any change in behavior or engagement since yields
have started to come down around that offering?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I would say, ESP balances are higher yielding balances sort of at the same rate range as money market
funds. So that is typically a 100% deposit beta type product. And we have others, we have balances and
opportunities and certain balances at the – in the Bank segment as well. In total, when you look at our total
balances at the Bank side, deposits to the Bank segment and the sweep balances, roughly half of our – of those
balances are highest – higher rate, higher deposit beta type balances.

So we have a lot of protection to downside rates, which is a – which would give us some offsets with – as rates
decrease because obviously our floating – our assets are mostly floating rate assets. Now, what was the other
part of the question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Any changes in engagement with those higher yield products as we've seen rates come down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Not really. There – I think a lot of the cash reinvestment activity we saw are slowing down and decelerating well
before the rate decrease. And so we haven't seen sort of an acceleration or deceleration, frankly, that's notable
following the decrease.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good evening, Paul and good evening, Butch. Wanted to start with a question just on the spread revenue
guide for next quarter. The growth in sweep deposits was encouraging, even inclusive of the fee billings. Just
wanted to drill down into some of the inputs that are underpinning that lower spread revenue guide. Maybe more
specifically, just what deposit pricing changes are embedded in the guide, and does it contemplate any favorable
cash seasonality which we typically see around year-end?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, we've been accused of being conservative with our guidance in the past, particularly on this
guidance. So hopefully that proves to be the case this time around because loan balances are continuing to grow.
We're not really factoring in ongoing loan balance. This was more of a snapshot type view in terms of what the full
run rate of rate changes would be to both the BDP fees and NII.
And so, to your point, balances can increase throughout the quarter, whether it be cash balances, but hopefully
more loan balances. And that could offset some of the reduction in rate and the sensitivity of that. And I just gave
you the breakout of the deposits that are higher yielding and higher deposit beta versus the ones that are lower
yielding, lower deposit beta. And so that's kind of what went into our math.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. And for a follow-up just on wanted to drill down into some of the earlier comments you made on net
new asset growth and the pipeline. For both you and industry peers, this past year, we did see the moderation in
industry flow trends. I understand you struck a positive tone in terms of the pipeline of new advisors, but just trying
14


Raymond James Financial, Inc.
(RJF) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
to gauge what drove the slowdown in industry growth, whether we should interpret the comments on the pipeline
as supportive of an acceleration in that flow rate and which channels are seeing the fastest growth across the
platform, given the omnichannel offering?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
It depends on how you want to look at it. In our RIA part, RCS, it's by far the highest percentage growth, and as
consistent with industry trends, that's been growing quickly. If you look at total dollars, and this goes back and
forth, a couple of years ago, it was independent. This year, the employee channel really led the way. And it's – we
used to have, well, that independents grow faster than down markets, I mean, in up markets and employees in
slow markets. We don't see that trend anymore. It's really just where we can meet the teams that like an affiliation
option. And so employee led the way.
I actually think that we'll get some improvement in the independent contractor model because it's just cyclical and
the employee size has – seems to have a very good backlog as was RCS. So we're encouraged. But it's a
process both to get people to commit and get people in the door. So we can never predict the timing, but we're
encouraged, even with the great results, that we could do better. So...

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hi, guys. Good afternoon, and Butch welcome to the call as well. I wanted to follow-up to Steven's question
around cash trends. Is it possible to unpack sort of sources of growth you saw in the third quarter, your fiscal
fourth quarter across the cash stack and curious whether it is really kind of abating of the sorting, or are you
starting to see more cash coming on to the sidelines as net new assets coming in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I mean, we continue to grow a lot as a business, and as we grow and bring on new advisors, they bring on their
clients, they're going to bring on their clients' cash balance, and so – and that's been happening throughout the
last couple of years. It's just been masked by the fact that there's been a lot of reinvestment activity. And so as
that reinvestment activity decelerates and subsides, then you're going to start seeing the pure – the growth
coming in from the addition of advisors and their clients.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Yeah. That makes sense. So your point is kind of like, look, from this point on, like your cash balances are likely

Well you took my comments a couple of steps further, but I'm not sure we're willing to declare a total end to the
cash reinvestment. But that's the dynamic that you've seen over the last, I'd call, four to six quarters was that
dynamic has decelerated.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got you. Okay. Good enough. Thanks. And then a quick follow-up on the buyback. I just want to make sure I'm
interpreting your comments correctly. So $300 million share repurchases this quarter, a nice step up. Should we
assume that to be kind of run rate quarterly pace of buybacks from here as well or absent obviously like M&A or
anything like that? And if there are opportunities to do more, you're likely to do that as well. I'm just trying to
understand what the criteria are from here for trajectory of share repurchases.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I mean, to your point, we'd much rather use the capital to grow the business, whether it's through organic growth
acquisitions or balance sheet growth with loan growth. And we are optimistic on those fronts as well.
But to the extent that we're not using the capital and we're generating a pretty good earnings, then we want to
make sure that we limit further expansion of the capital ratio. And that's where we come up with the sort of pace
that we've been at here for the last quarter or maybe even a little bit more, depending on all those factors and
price and other things that we want to show our commitment to limiting further capital ratio growth, given how
strong it is now and it's over our target of 10%.

Bill Katz Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
...this evening. Just coming back to the margin discussion, excuse me, just wondering if you could unpack a little
bit from the top-down view of driving operating leverage to maybe the segment lines. So if I look at each, maybe
the Private Client business and the Capital Markets business in particular, the margins there improved reasonably
strongly, particularly in Capital Markets. So how do we think about the marginal margin in those segments?
And then coming back, Paul, to your comment – Paul Shoukry, to your comments of 22% margin is pretty fulsome
at this point. So how do we think about the incremental margin at segment level and then that sort of translating
into the overall margin outlook for holdco? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
How many more hours do you have tonight? Yeah, I mean, I think listen, to the extent that revenues grow in our
segments, then that should result in margin expansion for each one of our segments. Interest rates and spreads
have a big – play a big role in that, both with the Private Client Group segment and the Bank segment. And we
16


Raymond James Financial, Inc.
(RJF) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
just had a 50 basis point reduction. I think we can, over time, offset that impact by growing the balance sheet at
the bank as loan demand comes back. So, over time, I think we can do that.
And then to the extent Capital Markets margin improved this past quarter, but it hasn't been exactly great the first
three quarters of the fiscal year. So, the incremental margin, when you're operating at a loss, is pretty significant
especially with the significant revenue increase we had in the segment this quarter.
So, I'm just saying over time, what I cautioned the Street from doing is just assuming that the margin gets better in
every segment because everything goes in the right direction, and then that generates a substantially higher
margin than we generated this year. I think that's maybe not factoring in the puts and takes that are natural in our
diverse and complementary businesses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Katz Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Okay. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up. Just coming back to client cash for a moment, sort of seeing this
with some of your peers. You've seen a big pickup in client cash into the end of the quarter. And some have
pointed to just some fixed income liquidity maturities coming in, some uncertainty around interest rate
expectations, given some of the moves by the Fed, and obviously election coming up in just a couple weeks from
now.
So are you seeing a structural shift in the client cash, or is this more of a timing element on asset allocation that is
somewhat plumping up client cash, all else being equal, and it could sort of move back into more sort of AUM
type of levels and not so much on the NII side? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I would say our asset mix has been remarkably consistent. Advisors have been doing a very good job through
different cycles, both market cycles and rate cycles, keeping clients' asset mix relatively aligned with their long-
term investment objectives. And so, like for example, equities for us right now is roughly 60% on an ex-rate basis
of assets. And that's been consistent within 2 percentage points or 3 percentage points for the last several years
in various environments.
And so, the mix shift that you've seen over the last five years has really been within the cash category. When it's a
low rate environment, there's more in transactional cash. And when you're in a higher rate environment, there's
more investable cash there. And so, that's the only shift, I think, we've seen over the long term. And one quarter,
the difference, I think, in just the last couple of quarters is the deceleration I talked about of the sorting activity.
And now you're starting to see more of that growth coming in from just bringing on advisors as they bring on their
clients and existing advisors bring on new clients.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 23-Oct-2024
Good evening. Paul, you noted a continued focus on corporate development efforts and remaining disciplined
there. Just curious if you can give us an update on the M&A environment. Are you seeing more or less
opportunities today compared to earlier in 2024? Is the rate certainty helping to narrow bid/ask spreads for
potential targets? And any areas of focus we should really be thinking about in terms of the wealth segment, or
are there other areas you're considering for inorganic growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
We look across all of our businesses for growth. We really believe we're positioned for the right opportunities to
grow. And I'd say our corporate development team has done a great job of bringing opportunities to us, right. So
we look at a lot of deals. Some we just don't like the deals, the way they fit in our environment, some are not
culturally there, and some we like and we just can't get to terms on what we think is good long-term price. So,
we're constantly looking. We take them very seriously. We're, as you know, a conservative buyer, and that will be
competitive but we won't stretch way out to buy an asset.
And so, it really just depends when they click, and that's the hard thing on timing. Like a few years ago, people
say, well, you guys aren't going to buy anything. You're hoarding all this capital, and we closed four deals in the
next few months. I mean, it just took a while and they just all happened to hit around the same time. So, we're still
in that mode but we're not going to do a deal just to do a deal. It has to be something that fits and makes sense
for the firm and shareholders.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Makes sense. And for my follow-up, maybe just a question on the balance sheet, on the AFS portfolio, I know that
continued to run off in the quarter. I guess with some more clarity on the rate environment in terms of the direction
of travel with the Fed and still with significant excess capital, is there any desire to change your stance on that
and begin holding that steady or growing those balances in fiscal 2025? Or do you anticipate letting that portfolio
continuing to run off?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We let that portfolio grow modestly just really to accommodate client cash balances when the banks, during
the COVID period, didn't really want those balances. And so now all we're doing is getting back to sort of a
normalized liquidity level at both banks and primarily at Raymond James Bank, where we were accommodating
those balances. So once they get to that normal state, then we'll maintain the balance for the securities portfolio.
Banks typically need to run at maybe around a 10% to 15% liquidity ratio between cash and securities. And so,
Raymond James Bank is still well above that. And so, we'll let those securities run off. And then once they get to
that type of range, then we'll maintain the balances.
But the point is we're not taking bets on duration. We're not taking bets on where the Fed may or may not take
rates. That got a lot of our peers in trouble. And so we want to just stay focused on serving clients and keeping
the balance sheet as flexible as possible for anything that the market or the interest rate environment may bring
us.

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask about the PCG business [indiscernible] (00:58:46) operate
on, how that's performing and contributing across Canada and the UK today. I know you've done some
acquisitions there over the years. Just curious what you're seeing in terms of organic growth contribution over the
past year versus, say, fiscal 2023 and then Canada and the UK. Maybe you could talk a little about some of the
initiatives there to accelerate organic growth and improve scale and profitability.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
It's a little bit of a Tale of Two Cities for different reasons, but the Private Client Group in Canada is doing great
growth in recruiting. When we acquired that business, it was really a Capital Markets business and with the small
PCG business, and today, it's a very strong, like similar to the US, really a big capital – Private Client Group base,
continuing to recruit, similar profit margins, good growth, same kind of platforms that we have here in the US
where you have advisors' choice. And they executed very, very well to where we're really getting to the size of the
smallest of the largest banks, which is quite unusual in Canada. But we are – up there, we feel like a Canadian
firm and they just have a US parent. But they operate very, very well.
The UK, because we've done a recent acquisition, are still an integration. The growth has been kind of flat in that
as we get people and systems and everything really hooked together and going through that integration process,
the growth is much slower. But we anticipate once we're able to do that and get the integration, we expect to be
able to grow there. But it's a smaller business too. So won't have as long – won't have as big of an impact
consolidated.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. What we've disclosed so far, so maybe it's something we cover at Analyst Day or something. We haven't
really disclosed in detail, but we really get an asset fee there. So if you looked at pure RIA, the way they measure
margins, they are higher margins. If you look at our net on basis points on assets are lower. So part of it – the
service model is different too. You don't have all the supervision and compliance requirements that – an RAA has
those responsibilities or certain things that they do. They are clients of ours. Their clients are their clients. They
are not our clients. And outside of some AML responsibilities and just oversight to make sure they have process,
there's a lot less cost that goes into it, although we're a higher service model. So it's not easy to give a quick
answer, but it might be something that we can show in more detail at maybe the next Analyst Day.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. It's complicated. Again, as Paul said, the Analyst/Investor Day would be a good time to talk about. The
margin on a P&L basis is actually higher because the attachment revenue that you book is much lower whereas
in our other businesses, we gross up the revenues, prepay out. And then the ROCA just varies dramatically
depending on the asset mix that the RIA has and the pricing structure, because there's different pricing structures
depending on the RIA as well. So we can get probably more time than we have now to discuss, but
Analyst/Investor Day is probably the right forum for that.
