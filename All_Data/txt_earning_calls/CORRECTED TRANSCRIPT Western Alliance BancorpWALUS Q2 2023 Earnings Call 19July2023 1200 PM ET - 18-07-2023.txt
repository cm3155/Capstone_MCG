President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Miles, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll make some brief comments about our financial results
and action items, and then I'll turn the call over to Dale who will review the results in more detail before opening
the call for Q&A. Our Chief Credit Officer Tim Bruckner, as Miles said, is here with us as well. In many ways, this
quarter represented a transitional period for Western Alliance following the events of [ph] mid-March (00:01:33) as
our firm and our clients increasingly returned to a sense of normalcy. We continue to successfully execute on the
balance sheet repositioning strategy we laid out last quarter. We exceeded our liquidity guidance by growing
deposits by $3.5 billion and repaying over $6 billion in short-term borrowings. For the second quarter, WAL
generated total net revenues of $669 million, net income of $216 million, and EPS of $1.96. We maintained strong
profitability with return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of 1.23% and 18.2%
respectively, which grew tangible book value per share by $1.53 to $43.09 or 18% year-over-year and will
continue to support building capital levels in the quarters to come.
We achieved significant progress on the immediate and short-term objectives identified last quarter to establish a
sound foundation for WAL to sustain ongoing client and financial success. Notably, deposits grew $3.5 billion and
exceeded our $2 billion quarterly guidance. Growth was diversified across business lines and included brisk core
deposit growth from new and returning customers. Net liquidity growth of $2 billion allowed us to significantly
reduce higher-cost wholesale borrowing. WAL continues to expeditiously execute our balance sheet repositioning
strategy and completed $4 billion of total asset dispositions in Q2, which included $3.5 billion of loan dispositions,
ahead of the $3 billion outlined in Q1. Meaningful deposit growth and asset dispositions lowered WAL's loan-to-
deposit ratio to 94% and allowed us to rapidly reduce reliance on higher-cost FHLB borrowings by $6.1 billion
over the quarter. I'm proud to report core deposits have rebounded another $3.2 billion quarter-to-date, meaning
WAL's deposit levels are now $600 million above our year-end 2022 balance.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
CET1 capital of 10.1% increased from 9.4% on March 31 and 8.7% or 140 basis points since Q3 2022 when we
initially announced the bank's capital building initiatives through organic capital generation without equity
issuance. Finally, we continue to focus on meeting our core client banking needs in order to cultivate strong long-
term relationships. Leveraging third party products to significantly grow reciprocal deposits has lifted our insured
and collateralized deposit levels to 81%, one of the highest among large US banks. As we move through the back
half of the year, we believe bank investors will place more emphasis on balance sheet strength, stressing the
fundamentals of growing [indiscernible] (00:04:33), improve liquidity, deposit cost composition and granularity,
stable asset quality, moderate and thoughtful loan growth, and producing predictable and sustainable PPNR.
The bank's diversified funding strategy continue to focus on growing attractive funds from a diverse set of clients
and channels in order to prioritize repayment of the more expensive wholesale funding sources and then to
optimize deposit balances from lower cost sources to deploy into superior risk-adjusted lending opportunities as
we have done historically. Driving the $3.5 billion deposit growth was significant new and returning customer
activity throughout Western Alliance. In Q2, we attracted $1 billion from approximately 1,000 new and returning
commercial relationships at an attractive average total deposit cost of 1.98%, with notable contributions from
mortgage warehouse, regional banking, and settlement services. Over $400 million of net-new deposit money
was in non-interest bearing DDA. Our commitment to foster multi-product customer relationships has been the
key to onboarding new deposits in a very competitive environment.
Additionally, we will utilize other diversified sources of deposits to accelerate repayment of wholesale borrowings
and return to prudent lending. Our recently launched online consumer channel is demonstrating steady progress,
providing another source of uncorrelated liquidity and generated approximately $700 million this quarter at
attractive rates compared to the marginal costs of repaid borrowing. Going forward, continued deposit channel
optimization and growth and new and returning core client commercial relationships will lower the proportion of
funds generated from brokered CD [indiscernible] (00:06:25).
Now Dale will take you through our financials.

Dale M. Gibbons
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Ken. For the quarter, Western Alliance generated net income of $216 million, EPS of $1.96, and pre-
provision net revenue of $282 million. Net interest income decreased $60 million during the quarter to $550
million, mostly from elevated higher costs to return borrowings that were materially reduced near quarter-end.
Q2's net interest income should be considered a trough with Q3 and Q4 levels [indiscernible] (00:06:55). Non-
interest income increased to $119 million from an adjusted level of $102 million in the second quarter. As a
reminder, loans marked in Q1 in a net loss, $141 million, as part of our balance sheet repositioning efforts are
responsible for negative fee income last quarter on a reported basis. On an operating basis, non-interest income
was $18 million higher from Q1. The green shoots we cited with mortgage last quarter were evident again in the
second quarter as AmeriHome revenue increased $13 million to $86 million.
We remain cautiously optimistic as continued stabilization, improving margins, and profitability momentum is
sustainable as AmeriHome capitalizes on the exit of a major competitor from the correspondent funding channel
earlier this year. Production margins went closer to normalized levels of 43 basis points as the industry
rationalized and win rates continue to improve. Other non-interest expense growth was driven by higher insurance
costs related to elevated insured and brokered deposit levels which also include core reciprocal deposits above a
certain threshold. Provision expense of $22 million is indicative of a return to a more normalized credit
environment. We remain conservative on macro assumptions; and as a commercial bank, the outlook for
commercial real estate is a key driver that informs our provisioning. Our allowance for credit losses modelling

assumes an 80% likelihood of a recession using Moody's analytics scenarios. A lower tax rate was beneficial to
earnings this quarter and we expect to go forward with a normalized rate as an average of the last two.
We made substantial progress in our balance sheet repositioning and surgical asset disposition efforts in the
second quarter to accelerate higher capital and liquidity building. These dispositions complemented our organic
earnings and contributed approximately 43 basis points of incremental CET1 capital. $4 billion of asset
dispositions were completed, including loan sales of runoffs primarily in equity fund resources, syndicated loans,
and mortgage warehouse businesses. The equity fund resource credit-linked note was also fully unwound. Loans
held for investment increased $1.4 billion to $47.9 billion. Deposits increased $3.5 billion which brought balances
to $51 billion at quarter-end. Mortgage servicing rights balances of $1 billion rose 11% during the quarter. Total
borrowings were reduced by $6.3 billion to $11.5 billion due mostly to paydowns in Federal Home Loan Bank
borrowings. In March 31, remaining EFR credit-linked note was also fully redeemed.
We completed the unwind of [ph] $542 million (00:09:32) of CLNs year-to-date. The positive momentum has
continued into the third quarter as deposits are $3.2 billion higher from June 30. Total held-for-investment loan
growth of $1.4 billion consisted of $700 million of organic loan growth primarily for mortgage warehouse, regional
banking divisions, and resort finance. Improved liquidity from deposit growth well in excess of loan growth allowed
us to reclassify $700 million of held-for-sale loans back to held-for-investment which will improve the company's
return profile. Deposit growth of $3.5 billion resulted from remixing the deposit base into interest-bearing DDA
from savings and money markets as well as CD growth from client promotions and brokered CDs. Non-interest
bearing DDAs comprise a third of our total deposit mix, with approximately half having no cash payment or
earnings credits.
Turning now to our net interest drivers, the securities portfolio grew $1 billion to $10.1 billion as we look to bolster
our high-quality liquid asset balances. Yield expanded at 8 basis points to 4.76% largely from floating rate
maturities benefiting from higher rates. We continue to benefit from higher reinvestment rates as approximately
$1.3 billion of securities are expected to mature in the second half of this year and $1.1 million additionally in
2024. The spot rate for the entire portfolio was 4.85% at quarter-end. Held-for-investment loans increased $1.4
million and the portfolio yield increased 20 basis points to 6.48%. At quarter-end, the spot rate was 6.74%.
Interest-bearing deposit cost rose 33 basis points to 3.08% or a $3 billion increase to $34 billion. The elevated
cost resulted from a higher interest rate environment which offset [indiscernible] (00:11:21) non-interest-bearing
demand deposit growth. Total cost of funding rose 58 basis points to 2.5% from higher utilization of wholesale
borrowings with an average cost of 5.6%.
$6 billion of these borrowings were repaid which produced a $3.4 billion difference between average and end-of-
period balances. Optimizing the funding mix with more core and reciprocal deposits in conjunction with the $6
billion of Federal Home Loan Bank paydowns which occur later in the quarter positions us for improving funding
cost to support our net interest margin guidance. Moving down further into our funding base, we have actively
utilized reciprocal deposit channels to drive growth and provide greater insurance coverage to larger depositors.
62% of brokered deposits consist of sticky reciprocal deposits. We believe these core client relationships have
been fortified through this product enhancement, making them exceptionally stable. Overall, net interest income
decreased approximately $60 million or 9.8% over the prior quarter which should compress net interest margin
and average-earning assets declining $562 million, mostly stemming from balance sheet repositioning actions.
Net interest margin compressed 37 basis points to 3.42% with a higher interest expense from outsized higher-
cost borrowings as excess liquidity is generated with deposit growth greater than loan growth and non-
AmeriHome held-for-sales are liquidated. We expect pay down additional repo lines costing SOFR plus 2% and
should contribute to funding cost tailwinds. The effect of these dynamics can start to be seen in the expansion of

the June NIM to 3.5%. Our efficiency ratio of 57% improved by about 500 basis points from the second quarter,
though our adjusted efficiency ratio increased to 50% from 42% in the prior quarter. Higher insurance costs from
elevated brokered and insured deposits as well as lower net interest income from increased interest expense
were the main reasons for this change. We still view mid to upper 40s adjusted efficiency as the right level and
expect expenses to align with our core run rate of revenue as we look to optimize additional work streams
throughout the bank.
Pre-provision net revenue was $282 million during the quarter. Solid profitability was sustained with the Q2 return
on average assets at 1.23% and return on average tangible common equity of 18.2%. Strong PPNR provides
capital flexibility to absorb provision expense and credit losses if warranted while still growing the balance sheet
and attaining higher CET1 capital levels. Given the increased attention on the commercial real estate sector,
we're providing additional details on our CRE investor and office portfolios as well as our overall early
identification and elevation credit mitigation strategy as this proactive migration approach has historically
produced lower loss to margins. Our CRE investor underwriting strategy rests on the foundation of low loan-to-
cost underwriting in some markets where we have deep experience and strong financial sponsors. As a reminder,
our financing structures carry no junior liens or mezzanine debt which enables maximum flexibility in working with
clients and sponsors.
We have low uncovered tail risk as 92% of the portfolio has LTVs below 17%, and these LTVs are based upon
the most recent appraisals and assuming commitments are fully funded. Within commercial real estate, office
accounts for just 5% of total loans. We have previously discussed our focus on shorter-term bridge loans and
repositioning office projects in suburban areas. Our exposure in [indiscernible] (00:15:09) central business district
areas that we believe are most vulnerable to work from home risk are minimal at just 3% of office loans. We have
re-designated some mid-term exposure away from the CBD classifications because in our view, dynamics in
these markets make them less susceptible to work from home risk versus larger cities. For example, we do not
have CBD office loans in New York, Boston, Chicago, Atlanta, Houston or Dallas.
Looking at LTVs, you'll notice only 3% of office has an 80% or greater loan-to-value and aligns with our central
business district exposure. We primarily focus on in-demand Class A to B+ office properties, and 94% of Class A
properties have LTVs below 70%. The entire office book carries an LTV of 55%. Finally, we are not facing a large
maturity and WAL's approximately three-quarters of loans come due in 2025 or later. Turning to asset quality
trends, in light of the unprecedented environment and due to the sharp increase in interest rates over the past 12
months, we have completed a proactive, comprehensive review of our commercial real estate portfolio which is
reflected in loan migrations this quarter. This is part of our early identification and early elevation credit mitigation
strategy and has served us well. We proactively move loans into special mention when cash flow may be curtailed
in the present environment despite having well-supported collateral values and [indiscernible] (00:16:40).
Sponsorship remains strong in the loans still current. We do this to ensure attention and monitoring at the highest
levels within our credit organization as we require the sponsors to re-margin the loan to establish [indiscernible]
(00:16:54) cash reserves to support a cash rating. This is an important element of our credit control process, an
established process for more than 10 years. As a result of these efforts, special mention loans increased to $694
million or 1.45% of funded loans with $250 million or two-thirds of migration coming from offices and hotels.
Classified assets increased $145 million, a 89 basis points of total assets. Half of the increase in classified assets
was driven by [ph] one $75 million (00:17:25) office loan in Downtown San Diego which makes up the
preponderance of the central business district office exposure I mentioned. We don't anticipate meaningful losses
as this property is 82% leased, current appraisal exceeds the outstanding loan amount, and all cash flow will go to
pay down this credit.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Our proactive identification and resolution process results in lower realized losses. Over the last 10 years, less
than 1% of special mention loans have become losses. And within commercial real estate investor property, less
than 10 basis points of special mention loans have migrated to loss. When looking at the next two slides, you'll
see the results of our early identification and elevation negotiation resolution process has resulted in best-of-class
loss rates over the last 10 years. The rest of Western Alliance is about the process which sometimes produces
earlier, criticized, and classified designations but, at the end of the day, leads to low net charge-offs. On average,
we're ranked in the top third among asset peers for adversely-graded loans as a percentage of total loans and
hold the best ranking on losses. The difference between our ranking on adversely-graded loans compared to our
number one position of historical credit losses highlights the success of our proactive credit mitigation strategy.
Quarterly net loan charge-offs were $7.4 million or 6 basis points of average loans compared to net loan charge-
offs of $6 million or 5 basis points in the first quarter. Our total loan ACL rose almost $13 million from the prior
quarter to $362 million due to higher provisioning and low loan loss rates. Total loan allowance for credit losses to
funded loans increased 1 basis point to 76 basis points in Q1 but is 94 basis points when loans covered by credit-
linked notes are excluded. The allowance was 141% for non-performing loans at the end of the quarter. We feel
well-positioned in an uncertain economic environment based on the business transformation since the global
financial crisis. Our loan portfolio is diversified across risk segments with almost a quarter it of either credit-
protected, government-guaranteed or cash-secured, and over half of the portfolio is either insured or resistant to
economic volatility. These percentages align with weightings reported before we embarked on our balance sheet
repositioning initiative late in the first quarter.
Of note, our lower average loss grades in the resilient and more sensitive categories are indicative of
conservative underwriting and highly responsive remediation actions. We discussed reprioritizing building capital
back to pre-merger levels in our Q3 2022 earnings call. Since then, CET1 capital has grown from 8.7% to 10.1%
and is up over 70 basis points since the first quarter. Our tangible common equity to total assets rose 50 basis
points from the first quarter to 7%. We remain committed to achieving a medium term CET1 target of 11% which
we view as prudent considering the heightened regulatory tension regarding appropriate capital levels. We also
expect increased excess capital will provide more financial and strategic optionality in the future. Looking at the
strong combination of insured deposits and high capital to make depositors comfortable with the stability of their
financial institution, Western Alliance has materially moved its insured deposit levels to among the highest in the
nation compared to the largest banks.
Capital has also lifted into the top third even adjusting for fair value marks in both the available-for-sale and held-
to-maturity securities portfolios. Inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend which came in at $0.36 per share, our
tangible book value per share increased $1.53 in the quarter to $43.09. Western Alliance's compelling long-term
tangible book value per share divergence from peers remains intact. This increased over six times that of the peer
group since the end of 2013 which equates to a compound annual growth rate of nearly 20% [ph] amidst
(00:21:42) economic cycles and market disruptions. This outperformance is still four times that of peers when
adding common dividends back.
I'll now hand the call back to Ken to conclude with closing comments.

Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Dale. Our guidance for the rest of 2023 continues to be driven by the strategies and priorities laid out in
our prior earnings call. Let me tell you what you could expect from here.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Regarding capital, having exceeded our immediate CET1 target of 10% in Q2, we expect continued although
more gradual growth in our capital ratios with a medium-term CET1 ratio target of 11% in 2024. This will be driven
by our continued strong return on average tangible common equity and capital generation. Core deposits are
expected to grow at approximately $2 billion per quarter and exceed more muted loan growth by approximately
$1.5 billion. This will lower our loan-to-deposit ratio over time towards a mid-80% target.
Net interest margin is expected to rise modestly from our Q2 trough of 3.42% and land in the range of 3.5% to
3.6% for the second half of 2023 based on our successful repayment of borrowings this past quarter and the cost
of new deposit [indiscernible] (00:23:03). Our efficiency ratio, excluding the impact of deposit costs, should
decline slightly to the high-40s given the reduced borrowing costs and higher asset yields. Asset quality remains
manageable as it returns to more normalized levels. We expect credit losses to be 5 to 15 basis points through
the economic cycle.
Overall, for the second half of 2023, we expect quarterly operating PPNR to remain consistent to Q3 results and
begin to climb as we exit the year. As we continue to reposition the balance sheet and continue to reestablish our
core deposit and loan growth trajectory, we see Western Alliance as an even better institution and well-positioned
for the future. We view our earnings performance, being driven by balance sheet growth, improving margins and
efficiency along with continuous strengthening in our mortgage operations that should result in quarterly operating
PPNR consistent to Q2 2023 results and then grow thereafter.
At this time, Dale and Tim and I are happy to take your questions.

I was curious if we could – I mean, I'm sure we're going to get a lot of questions on credit because deposits seem
to have cleared themselves up. But if we could just take a moment to kind of just walk through the guidance a little
bit further. I was curious on what are you guys assuming for just average earning assets for the back half of the
year with that margin guide? And it seems like you already have that spread difference of plus $2 billion per
quarter, which gives you $4 billion in deposits. And then on loans, it's plus $1 billion. So you already have that $3
billion essentially now. Can we see the paydown of debt pretty immediate in the third quarter or do you think it's a
bit more granular throughout the second half of the year?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, we still have a couple of billion dollars that fund our $3 billion that we have in our held-for-sale loans with
repo relationships with another commercial bank. And those loans – and those funds we have borrowed from
them cost us SOFR plus 200 basis points. So paying that down with some of the liquidity we bring in is going to
help improve our net interest income but doesn't really change earning assets. But in addition to that, we do
expect that a portion of these dollars we bring in are going to be used to provide new credit opportunities to our
clients. And so it's going to be a combination of the two. So I'm looking for earning assets to continue to climb, but
not as fast as the deposit growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then if we could just take a moment to think just kind of holistically about credit
here. It seems like you got a decent amount of NPL increases and the reserve was essentially the same, up a
modest uptick. So with credit-linked notes being a little bit less of importance now that we've kind of had a
strategic repositioning, how do we think about the allowance going forward in terms of like a GAAP percentage
relative to the loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, a couple of things. I mean, in terms of what the ratio is, I think it's really important to note how much – what
our charge-offs have been and why that number may be [ph] screams (00:27:10) lower relative to other
institutions. We don't have consumer loans which have a constant burn rate of losses. And in addition, I
mentioned the Moody's scenario as well. So we took 60% of their consensus forecast. That has two consecutive
quarters, third quarter and fourth quarter this year of a recession in it. And then we took 20% with it an S-4, which
is the severe recession whereby you are seeing contraction in commercial real estate values in excess of 30%.
What's important about that is because we're a low advance rate lender, even with significant reductions in terms
of valuation, we still don't incur losses because our borrower still has skin in the game. They still have equity that
they want to protect, and they're still willing to negotiate with us in terms of how we can come to a solution set
together. So it's really – [ph] if we lend it out (00:28:01) at a much higher rate, we wouldn't be in that position. But
because of our low advance rate, that's been really key to our strong asset quality.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
But if you're asking a question about the provisioning going forward, I would say it's about in the same vicinity
going forward as Q2's provisioning for Q3 and Q4.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just want to follow up on the borrowing paydown. So just you guys
have a PPNR guide of around $280 million, what you have here in the second quarter. Just wondering the pace of
what the guide assumes for borrowing paydown and timing as well, like how low does that $10 billion go?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, I don't have a number for you, Casey, exactly. What I would say is we're trying to do two things here. One is
pay down further, particularly the more expensive line, as I mentioned, but secondly as well to provide more
liquidity for our clients, so the combination of those two. I don't have a number in terms of what exactly that looks
like, but that's the trajectory we're on. That's the trajectory we started to be on in the second quarter. And I think
we're going to be more focused on that as we [ph] complete 2023 (00:29:37).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And given the progress you guys have made on the deposits quarter-to-date, which is pretty strong, has
there been any paydown quarter-to-date and you're making use of that deposit growth? Like do you have a
borrowing balance as of July 17th?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. This is Ken. Yeah, we do. Let me just take you to the deposits. Yeah. We're seeing great deposit growth so
far early into the quarter. To remind everyone, that's the natural flow of our deposits, they grow early. And just
about in the next couple of days, we're going to see some paydowns coming from our warehouse lending group
for P&I and [ph] D&I (00:30:26) accounts. And so those deposits will shrink, okay. So for us, we have the
borrowings scheduled to be paid down probably closer to the backend of the quarter as a safer way of thinking
about it. As we grow our deposits to $2 billion, we actually hope we can do better but as we grow our deposit
growth to $2 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Very good. And just, I guess, switching to the dispositions, about $1.8 billion left. So apologies, if I missed
this, but can you get that done this quarter and within the original fair value mark of 2% that you took?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
We've updated our marks. We think that they're good. What we did initially, I think, proved to be pretty accurate. I
don't think it's all going to get done this quarter, but we expect to make kind of significant progress on that. And as
I mentioned, that will be coincident with paying down higher cost [indiscernible] (00:31:23).

Thanks for the question, Casey. But we were pretty early in moving assets to HFS, and I think our aggressive
posturing of that helped us keep the dispositions inside of our [ph] locks (00:32:19). And that's sort of the hallmark
and the culture here at the company, and which connects to the asset quality that were – approach that we take
as well. So we tend to be early on everything and trying to execute early on. We have found whether it's
disposition of assets, whether it's asset quality in talking to clients, being there early, being there first produces
better results. So I just wanted to add that little color commentary.

Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So on slide 5 of your presentation, you showed some nice detail on the growth drivers of
that $3.4 billion of deposits during the quarter. It looks like, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks, about $1
billion in core deposit growth with the new and returning client deposits and existing client net growth, so that's
about one-third returning funds and two-thirds new money. So if that mix is right, is this the type of mix between
new money and returning money you would expect, say, over the next few quarters and potentially improve over
time? And maybe if you could give us a sense what that mix was for the $3.2 billion you noted quarter-to-date?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Regarding where the funds have come from, I think that there are some clients that were really waiting for our
second quarter results, wanted to make sure that the noise related to Q1 had cleared. [ph] There were never
(00:34:00) kind of financial institution failures during this kind of interim period. And so I think we have a strong
ability to pull in funds [indiscernible] (00:34:11) in the near-term from some of the returning clients. That, of
course, will diminish over time when there's less funds to return to begin with. But at the same time, we can [ph]
gen up (00:34:23) again some of our deposit business lines, which were a little hamstrung after what happened in
with Silicon Valley Bank. So some of the initiatives, particularly in settlement services and our corporate trust
operation, clients gave pause after seeing what had happened to that institution. And so that's not new. That's not
old money returning, but that is an acceleration of new opportunity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I would take that question and just maybe add a little bit different perspective or observations. Which is the
March disruption really disrupted our pipeline going forward, and we have a very, very strong pipeline in business
escrow services, in corporate trust, I should say corporate trust was a developing pipeline, but really in settlement
services. And so the disruption in March actually disrupted our pipeline. We're seeing that pipeline reappear
stronger. As Dale said, a lot of people wanted to wait until we were announcing our quarterly earnings. I think that
will make people feel comfortable, and we have some great deal of comfort on that pipeline returning which gives
us comfort to the $2 billion guide that we've put out there for deposit growth.
So I think what you'll see is besides the regions which are seeing healthy deposit growth and also led by Bridge
Bank and our tech and innovation space, it will see growth come for the rest of the year in the business escrow
services, in settlement services, in HOA. By the way, those are three stand-alone deposit channels which we
have been developing over the past couple of years and also in our online consumer platform as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Got it. Thanks for that color. Just as a follow-up, I'm just wondering, I believe a big chunk of the deposit
growth was also in CDs. Just curious, how far are you going on, say, some of the promotional pricing, given you
and the industry are leading with rates paid just given the current environment. Just trying to get a sense of how
much of these balances can be sticky or how can you deepen the relationship so these deposits do become
sticky?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I mean, on the broker element, I wouldn't call those sticky. However, I would call them cheaper. So what we
borrow from some of these credit lines as well as from the Federal Home Loan Bank are at – those rates are
higher than the brokered CD channel. In addition to that, brokered CDs do not consume liquidity opportunities. So
if we borrow, we have a credit line that is over $10 billion from the Federal Home Loan Bank. But as you borrow
against it, you have less availability. To bring in broker deposits, it costs less, and it leaves that availability open.
So this is something we're going to wean ourselves down from over time. But you're not going to see a chop-off
during the third quarter. But all the guide that Ken mentioned that we have in terms of our deposit growth
prospectively does not assume any growth for deposit increases from where we were at June 30th.

Operator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is
now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everybody. I wanted to start and drill down a little bit into the $3.2 billion you're calling out through July 17th.
What's the rough composition of that? Are those more new and returning client funds, [ph] you used (00:38:06)
any brokered in there? And very roughly, what's the cost so far?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
As it relates to the composition, very little is coming from the brokered CD channel as Dale mentioned. It's actually
zero. Whether you're seeing it come from is all warehouse lending and no financing group, which generally builds
up in the early parts of the month and then paid down towards the third week and then restarts its build process in
the fourth week. So you're seeing those funds come in. Generally, they're non-interest-bearing deposits. They do
carry ECR credits, which we're seeing in the operating expense. We also are showing very early on signs of a
very strong HOA deposit build as well. So primarily that's where the funds are coming from.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
And I think there's also been some repatriation from our debt group. We did have losses from that in March and
those dollars are up month-to-date as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, I think Dale brings an important point up on the tech group. There's been a lot of disruption with the demise
of SVB there. And our brand, Bridge, is a steady, consistent player in that market. And what you're seeing is a lot
of disruption with clients, with former people that have worked at SVB and their new companies, establishing their
operating processes and credit policies. Now that has all been established for us and people know our players
and they know the type of bank we are. And I think that's going to lead to more deposit growth out of Bridge,
which is going to support your overall regional deposit growth as we move forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. That's helpful. I'm curious, in terms of the deposit that's left in the aftermath of SIVB, what rough
percentage would you say have returned? Is it like 5%? Is it a material percentage at this point? And then what
are you hearing from, one, the customers returning? Dale, I think you mentioned they were waiting to see your 2Q
numbers. But then for the customers that haven't returned, what are you hearing from them why they haven't
returned yet?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, yeah, I mean, I'm going to say roughly 30%, maybe a third have come back. And why haven't they? Why
haven't we seen more? I think a lot of them – I mean, some of these are related to particular types of actions. So
I'll give you an example. Settlement services, you might have a settlement fund, and then that's moved to another
institution. And what we get back is the promise that we're not going to move that one back, but future settlements
will come to us. I think that's part of it. I think that there was some question about what's the new landscape going
to look like? I think it's well publicized that SVB had a policy, you got to bank with us and you can't bank anywhere
else. That has proven to have been damaging and damaging to some of these franchises. And so some of them
were like, okay, we were banking with you as most of them were just single entity institutions and now they're
building relationships in two or three banks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. The other thing is back to – we recaptured one large client that left us out of warehouse funding. And in
bringing that client back, they had a lot of funds in what we call P&I, principal and interest accounts. And those
build up rather quickly come down, pay, build up, come down every month, and it just oscillates back and forth.
Well, we went back to them and reestablished the relationship. We now took in P&I accident insurance accounts
which have a more steady stream to it. So what we've also done here is trade it off volatility of volume for more
consistency, and we've done that too.
So as we bring clients back, we're trying to get better quality deposits, longer-term and stickier. And so this has
allowed us to have a lot of great conversations with our client base. But I can tell you, I spend more time with the
depositors in meetings that feel like an earnings report. That's what we did coming out of Q1 and in Q2. Now, that
has all changed. And it's about really the growth of the relationships, the growth of the business and how we work
together. Well, that's some color there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Well, this quarter should help those conversations. Final question...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. We're seeing the pipeline built.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Even with the increase of more expensive type funding, if I just look at their sequential role in both interest
bearing deposit costs and total funding, these are decelerating pretty nicely over the past few quarters. Do you
guys expect that trend to continue through the back half of this year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So that's what gives us a little bit of comfort to provide the net interest margin guide going up. And again, as you
saw, June was 3.50%. And we think it rises from there and also gives us comfort to why we think net interest
income is going to be higher in Q3 than in Q2. Only a modest part of that net interest income rise is coming
14

actually from loan growth because we're going to grow $500 million to $1 billion, probably closer to $500 million is
a good number to use. That's going to come in ratably across the quarter, so you won't see that benefit until Q4.
So most of the growth in net interest income for Q3 is really coming from minimizing the rising cost of funds,
which we're very excited by.

Hey, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hello. Great. Thanks. In terms of the PPNR guide, you addressed the net interest income component. I wonder if
you could spend a minute on both the expenses and the AmeriHome aspect of just getting a full circle on PPNR. I
mean, obviously, the deposit and the insurance lines are [indiscernible] (00:44:38) comment there and then also
kind of comment on the gain-on-sale margins approaching normalizes [indiscernible] (00:44:46) on AmeriHome?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Okay. So AmeriHome generated about $88 million of total banking revenue. For us, we modeled that out at about
the same amount for Q3 and Q4. I will say it is early on, it's only 17 or 18 days into July, but they are having a
very, very strong July. And why is that? Well, production margins have stabilized and actually returned to more
historic levels. So they're running closer to 43, 44, 45 bps. And what we saw was the retreat of one very large
money central bank from the correspondent lending market combined with the industry capacity rationalization
has paved the path towards higher margins, higher win rates. And that's what's giving us a good deal of comfort.
With that, we're also building an MSR which gives value and is producing double-digit returns. And so growing our
capital allows us to bring in more servicing income. So that's the AmeriHome story. So for us, it's steady home
and mortgage banking revenue going forward with potential upside given what we're seeing in the current market.
That's how I would describe AmeriHome.
Related to the expense efficiency or we'll call the adjusted expense efficiency, we see that over time coming back
into the high-40s. Well, I think what's very important here is that to remember that WAL has always made
investments with a viewpoint towards longer term returns for its business, product, service development, and we
focus on generating consistent earnings with the appropriate returns. And so, over the last several years, what
15

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
we're talking about today, this is escrow services, settlement services, corporate trusts, the online consumer
platform, and the growth, the continued growth in HOA were all funded by consistent expense investments in our
P&L. So we are going to balance the efficiency ratio for future growth as well as looking to get to our PPNR guide.
And our PPNR guide are at the high – consider the adjusted efficiency ratio to remain at the high – in the high-40s
to achieve the PPNR guide that we've given.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Essentially, I mean I think we've had a reputation that we're pretty efficient. We've been in the low-40s for a
number of years. And now, we find ourselves elevated from that level. But we've also grown very quickly during
that period of time, and it's just natural, as one that's in kind of a strong growth mode, that some things are done
that aren't as efficient as they could have been structured or organized at that time. We're going through a
process now to streamline that and look through some of these elements in terms of whether it's vendors or
consultants and things like this that we think also can push down some of these extra costs that we've had in our
operating expense line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's great color. If I could ask a follow-up. You talked about net interest income growing exiting the year. If I
take a step back and think about PPNR, the stable number for the back half of the year. As the balance sheet
normalizes and everything gets back to normal, is the expectation that the PPNR dollar should grow off that low
$280s million as we enter 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So the way I would think about it, it's a little more stable in Q3 as we look to pay down our borrowings. And
we maintain that Q3 PPNR to Q2 and then seeing that begin to rise in Q4 as we ended the year into 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. But as you get into the fourth quarter and entering next year, if everything else is considered with the
balance sheet, your PPNR should grow again in 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A

[ph] I'm saying (00:49:09) it should grow in Q4 and then it'll continue on from there.

Hello, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. I wanted – hi. So I wanted follow up on the expense question. So you mentioned about optimizing
work streams through the bank. Could you elaborate on that? Are we talking kind of trimming on the edges, or are
you contemplating exiting any businesses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So we're talking about trimming on the edges here predominantly. And some of the expense savings that we are
going to find throughout the company will be repositioned into risk control, risk management infrastructure. I think
you have to keep in mind, and the regulators had clearly signaled this, that they're going to have a higher
standard of supervisory review for banks under $250 billion but above $100 billion, but I think they're going to drop
that below $100 billion. And as we continue to grow, we need to be prepared for that, and we've been preparing
all along. But some of that expense savings, we're going to take and we're going to reinvest in the risk control
infrastructure that we're going to need to cross $100 billion. We'd rather do it early on and have a steady growth
of expenses related to that rather than to wait and try to put it in just before you get to $100 billion.
So, David, so we're going to see some of the work stream repositioning in terms of lower cost, as Dale said,
vendor management, eliminating growth in FTE. We don't need, that's like cutting air. That will help us a little bit.
And then looking at vendor management, using technology, a lot of those cost savings will be repositioned into
the tech – into the risk management side, so we can continue to grow unabated as the rules change for the $100
billion and above and the $100 billion and below banks.

Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Let me take this one. Thank you. Tim Bruckner. This is something that we're, I think, pretty proud of. Dale
mentioned throughout the initial discussion comments, there's a few things that are just foundational to our credit
process. First, in all areas, we assess risk as covered and uncovered. Okay. So we really minimized tail risk by
that. Covered means you've gotten out always by collateral. Early identification and elevation are key, and then
time is of the essence in solving problems.
We manage tail risk by managing our uncovered exposure by getting to that early. To do that, we have to be
pretty mechanical in our process. So to answer your question directly, in all cases, special mention loans are
current and paying as agreed. Okay. So special mention, and a regulatory definition means potential weakness,
not default or late payment. So we're not looking for a monetary default. We're looking for situations where there
might be potential weakness, so that we can elevate those within our credit architecture and make the appropriate
changes before those become problems. So we use special mention to elevate the situation and [ph] driving to
(00:53:15) a satisfactory resolution before we're dealing with a default or a late payment.
Another thing that you can say here is everything that's in special mention, we believe that we're going to reach
that resolution which would be a satisfactory, re-margining or additional support from sponsorship that would
return that [ph] to pass or we have that credit substandard (00:53:37). So that's how we use the category's
mechanical [ph] arm process (00:53:44). Thank you.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Most have been asked and answered. But just looking at the loan
growth this quarter, I guess, surprised to the upside, just curious as to what drove that? How much of that was
kind of contractual fundings? And as you look forward, what gives you confidence in getting to that $500 million
number versus the growth that we saw in 2Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Okay. Great. Well, the $1.4 billion of loan growth, you can break it in half. 50%, $700 million was really a reclass
from held-for-sale, going back into held-for-investment, which means that our deposit drive, our increase in
liquidity do not necessitate having to sell those loans. And so we were pleased with that. Then we had $700
million of organic growth this quarter. And then most of that came from the warehouse lending but those financing
MSR lines of business. And why that's important is those businesses carry – when we make credit decisions
there, we usually get a fair amount of deposits that come along with this. So they almost self-fund themselves. So
that was the beauty of having that loan growth, that it also drove our deposit growth. And as part of what we've
been saying even from the last couple of calls, that we're looking at full client relationships. And we're no longer
18

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
just giving credit and then worrying about how we fund it away from the client. The client needs to have a full
relationship with us.
As we go forward and what we may have – what gives us some credit or our confidence, I guess, on the $500
million guide, we see a few areas that we're going to focus on, a little bit more in C&I at this point. But we see
MSR lending providing opportunity, [ph] loan financing (00:55:50) providing opportunity. We do [ph] resort
(00:55:53) lending which we think will provide opportunity. And we're doing tech and innovation loans. And these
are small-sized loans or loan commitments under $15 million. And we see there's great opportunity to bring with it
a great deal of deposits. So those are some of the areas that we are focusing on that gives us some comfort level
to the $500 million guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then now I asked this question last quarter, and I think it may be a little bit early. But with some
of the return of technology-related customers, I guess, where do you see Western Alliance fitting in to the tech
ecosystem going forward? Are you going to be playing a larger role in taking up some of the market share
abandoned by Silicon Valley? Or should we think about the technology offering of Western Alliance similar to
what had happened prior?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So that's an interesting question, a good strategic question. I think we're going to continue to play in the space
that we've been playing in, which is usually stage two. We're not going to be playing or taking up the role of SVB
in early stage lending. That's not what we do. We prefer to be in the middle stage and a little bit in the late stage.
So that's where we're going to continue to keep our focus. I will say that what we're seeing is that current and
prior SVB customers and bankers, as I said earlier before, continue to evaluate the changing landscape as both
constituencies are making judgements regarding long-term commitments to the industry by new players, and
they're waiting to see how those new players' credit policies, operating practices will be administered.
For us, Bridge Bank, as I keep saying, is uniquely positioned as a known brand and a consistent player in the
market, and I think that approach is continuing to get traction. So I have some great expectations from our tech
and innovation group, Bridge Bank, in terms of deposit growth in Q3 and going into Q4 as we continue to be the
steady player and the steady hand in that market that people can go to. When they come to us, they know what
our policies are. They know who they're talking to. They know what our credit decision-making process is. They
know how to reach senior management, and we have a track record with these folks. So we think it's an
opportunity for us, and we're excited by it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then just lastly for me, maybe following up on Bernard's question for some of the promotional
products. Just given how strong the deposit growth has been and the momentum you're gaining in bringing back
some prior customers, I guess why not pull back from some of the promotional rates? Is this nearly kind of a near-
term dynamic as you're continuing to build the liquidity, or are we still in an environment where the more, the
better, regardless of the cost?

There's a little bit of the more, the better. But maybe more significantly is those rates, which seem to be, I guess,
their market rate pricing, but they're still less than what we're paying for other sources. So here, we have a more
stable source and it's a lower cost and we're going to keep doing that. Now, over time, I think we are going to be
able to [ph] pay that (00:59:12). But so where we're headed is more liquidity is a good thing, and [indiscernible]
(00:59:20) less expensively, we're going to do that. [indiscernible] (00:59:24) the timing on your note, that was
[indiscernible] (00:59:27).

now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. First, on the – as it relates to keeping our guide, you talked about
fees in terms of how you're thinking about mortgage. But the service charge line this quarter increased from $9.5
million to almost $21 million. I don't recall you kind of mentioning that at all. Just curious what the driver was there.
I guess, ultimately, how is that level baked into the PPNR guide for the back half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Let me say it differently. Our total fee income we are looking at, which is primarily driven by AmeriHome, is going
to stay consistent for the next couple of quarters. So when you think about the PPNR guide, I would say, fee
income consistent with Q2, possibly with an arrow upward if some of the early signs of mortgage income success
in July continues throughout the quarter. And that's what's driving the PPNR guide that we gave earlier.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And then on the AOCI, Dale, I think you mentioned about $2.5 billion of securities to mature back half of
this year and through 2024. What amount of the kind of AFS-related AOCI just based on maturities would you
expect to recover over that 18-month period?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, I mean, obviously, those costs are related to kind of what the discount rate is. So if it's that close to maturity
and we have a yield that is less than what that looks like, then it's going to be fairly short. I mean, I think you really
get dollar improvement on the AOCI piece. What we really need is we really need lower rates. So it will roll
forward. If you take 18 months, we have a duration of four years on that. So you're taking one-third of that back.
So maybe a couple of hundred billion comes back, but not from maturity, it's just from a slower or a shorter
duration remaining on those securities, the four-year coming down by about a third. Regarding the service charge
income, so that, yeah, it is elevated from where we were and it's going to continue.

line is now open.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Just as a quick follow-up. One, in terms of the margin outlook as you talked about the third
quarter NIM, higher versus 2Q, does that trend continue into fourth quarter as we think about on a go-forward
basis or could we see some volatility in the margin where 4Q could be lower and [indiscernible] (01:03:31)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, what we're seeing is, I think, it's almost certain that they're going to raise next week. We have a modest kind
of asset-sensitive profile. So that should augment the NIM in that regard. More significantly, kind of what we
talked about a couple of times, the paydown in some of these more expensive funding sources. So I've talked
about these lines that we have that are SOFR plus 2%. We haven't paid those down yet. I expect that we will be
doing that significantly this quarter. I can't tell you exactly when, but let's say we did it in August or September.
We're going to see a follow-through effect on that into 4Q so, yes, I would expect that we should be looking for
21

kind of continued improvement. And Ken kind of alluded to this, what he said that our PPNR number kind of flat
for Q3 versus Q2 but then on a more positive trajectory as we go into Q4 and exit 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got that. And Dale, in terms of the actual loan book, how much of the loan book is yet to reprice in terms of just
reflecting the current [indiscernible] (01:04:46)? Like, how should we think about loan betas going forward and
repricing of the fixed rate book maybe?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I mean, the fixed rate book is predominantly residential real estate, and prepayment rates on those loans are
quite low. So at some point in time, I mean, I think probably rates have to come down a little bit before those are
really going to start to accelerate. So aside from that, I don't know that there's a whole lot of repricing opportunity
in the loan book. I think the securities book probably has more where we've got, as I mentioned, $1.2 billion in the
back half of this year and another $1 billion next year. Within the loan book, we've got another $1 billion that is
going to kind of roll in. So, I really think that the margin improvement and a big driver of the PPNR improvement is
really coming from swapping lower-cost funding sources compared to some of the elements that we have
supporting us today.

Hey. Thanks. Few questions for you. Tim, that slide 17, the asset quality slide, you guys talked about being
proactive. What do you think those lines look like in Q3 and Q4? Should we be prepared for those to go higher or
do you think that this proactiveness is going to keep those relatively flat?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Thanks. That's a good and very understandable question. I think relatively flat, and I think that because
that's been our experience with this approach and other cycles. Barring severe changes, and we're already
contemplating a tougher economy going forward, we elevated the situations. We know them by name. We're not
dealing with a large portfolio here in the absolute. We call those out, discuss them monthly. We don't wait till a

Jon Arfstrom Q

Dale M. Gibbons A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that ties into my next question, and I guess instead of poking and prodding I'll just ask it. You
guys are saying stable PPNR and then relatively stable provision based on Moody's and then S4 weighting that
you referred to. You guys usually give EPS guidance. Is this the trough on EPS? I'm looking at the $8.15
consensus for 2024. It feels like a layup given what you just put up, but am I missing something on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, we're not ready to project on 2024. But, I mean, I think the direction of what we've laid out for the third and
fourth quarter I think we have good confidence in. We obviously hope that we can continue to execute in terms of
bringing back lower-cost funding and expanding our underwriting prospectively. I mean, I'm not sure a recession
is in the offing. I think our expenses don't have a lot of elevation coming in them either, so I'm optimistic to what
the future holds here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So said another way, Dale, it feels like there's at least stability going into Q3 assuming nothing changes
materially from a credit point of view?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.

think has the pressure faded and it's going to be a distant memory and you're back to normal or you think there's
been some damage done?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So I don't think there's any permanent damage done, but I think there was – disruption is the word I would
continue to use. It took us off of our trajectory of growth. We had to rely on wholesale funding for a shorter period
of time. That's why you're hearing all the answers about the rise in NIM because we're going to swap out these
borrowings and bring in more deposits. This was all something that, believe it or not, in Q3 or the Q3 earnings call
of 2022 we had – I want to say anticipated that the world was going to change a little bit. We didn't anticipate what
was going to happen on March nine, but we started to move into a slower loan growth, higher liquid world with
greater capital, and that's sort of the model that we are using and we're moving forward. I think if there was any
damage done, it was done a little bit as I said in the deposit pipeline in some of our businesses that are still
relatively new relative to the other businesses in the company. And that gave people pause because they weren't
with us for a long period of time.
But we are rebuilding those deposit pipelines and that's giving me some optimism to the $2 billion guide for Q3
and the deposit guide going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
And Jon, it's actually been a little bit of a silver lining on some of this. And that is it has really got our attention and
made us focus on our business model, and we've honed it. So to the degree that we were doing some syndicated
deals, we were doing some writing credit, where we didn't have a deposit relationship, it's much more reciprocal
today. On our EFR case for example, we started by making $100 million commitments in a $1 billion syndication
line, but we're not doing that. We never got the liquidity from the clients in that situation. But instead, what we do
is we do bilateral transactions that are better priced and it's a closer relationship that we have with them, and of
course we get their funding as well. We've also taken a little bit of a different tack. We don't want to do this again,
and so what we've done is we have taken our insured deposit levels to about the highest in the nation. We're
moving our capital.
I want to spin it around so that when somebody is looking at who can we attack when the next situation might
arise, Western Alliance isn't anywhere near on that list because we're a stalwart for capital strength, liquidity, and
performance.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Dale, I was just hoping to dig a little deeper on the moving parts
on the margin, but I wanted to follow up on Steve's question and I'm sorry if you guys said it and I missed it. But
on the $3.2 billion of new deposits, I know it's weighted towards mortgage warehouse. But I was interested, and if
you have an idea, as to what the cost is just because when I look at the new and returned deposit growth and the
existing client growth, it looks like it had about a 2% cost on it for this quarter. Is that $3.2 billion close to that
cost?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, again, a lot of that – this is Ken, Brody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
A lot of the deposit growth is coming from our warehouse lending book which means it's growing in our non-
interest-bearing deposits. And from an interest expense point of view, that comes with a zero cost although the
ECR credits are in the operating expense line. So that's going to skew more towards having a lower interest
expense for both the warehouse lending business as well as some growth that's coming early on from HOA which
is a lower-cost channel as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. So if you're getting a lot of growth in the – I know it's got an ECR but it's non-interest-bearing. I'm looking at
that interest-bearing deposit cost and the spot rate at 3.05% is lower than the 3.08% you did on average for the
quarter. I guess if you're growing the interest-bearing deposit cost at a blended rate with those new clients or the
total deposit costs I guess at 2%, why wouldn't that interest-bearing deposit cost continue to move lower from
here in the third quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, so – I mean, warehouse deposits, they have an earnings credit rate which is much higher than 3%. It's close
to kind of effective Fed funds generally so it's going to be higher than that. But you're correct, Brody, in that, yeah,
these funds, they're not wholesale, they're not brokered so there's a lower charge associated with them in terms
of what that is in their client relationships, and so we're trading down in terms of what it's costing us from there. I
mean, HOA was a significant contributor; some of those have ECRs as well. But those dollars, those are going to
be in the 3% range as opposed to 5%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, your premise about a cost of funds equal to Q2 or Q3 going forward, that's not a bad premise.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it, okay. And then just on the loan yield, the average loan yield for the quarter, the difference between the
spot and the average for the quarter is relatively large. So the spot rate is 6.74%. If we think about the third
quarter and we think about a potential for another rate hike here, I guess how does the loan yield move off of that
6.74% for the third quarter assuming that that happens?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I mean, I think we're going to see something like 40% of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. So I guess if I take those two pieces combined then, Dale, just with like the deposit costs kind of stalling out
at this level and loan yields continuing to move higher, I just look at that 3.50% to 3.60% NIM guide, the implied
NII guide and the PPNR guide that you have for the back half of the year and it just feels exceptionally
conservative. And so I guess why shouldn't we be thinking about something well north of 2.82% by the time we hit
the fourth quarter of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, I would argue with exceptionally. I think it is – I think, I mean, we want to lean conservative obviously a little
bit. The other thing I would say that I think you need maybe to consider or recognize is that a lot of these deposit
costs we have are going to be moving up when the FOMC moves next week as well. So to the degree that we've
got kind of appropriate funding and some of these other sources relatively short-term earnings credit rates for
some of these large balances related to mortgage warehouse clients, those are going to move almost at lockstep
meaning that it doesn't show up necessarily in interest expense but it shows up in terms of the cost of our PPNR
number. So there is going to be a push up in terms of funding charges related to that as well. But as I mentioned,
we are asset-sensitive and so the net effect of what happens next week should be a plus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it, and then just last couple on credit for me. I just wanted to ask was there – you mentioned you did the office
CRE deep-dive. Was that – what kind of drove the re-appraisals on those office, those CBD office loans, Ken, or
was there something else specifically that drove that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Oh, that was it. That was it.

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I'm sorry. I was answering the other question which was [indiscernible] (01:17:56). We basically only have one
credit in CBD and that we moved to substandard, and then we re-appraised it and it re-appraised higher than the
loan amount. So that's the answer to that. I'm sorry I cut you off on the other question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
No, that's okay. I was just going to say I know that when you're working through the special mention loans, at
least this is what you did with the hotels during COVID, you kind of – as you mentioned, you asked them to re-
margin the loan. I guess it's early days but with any of those conversations with your sponsors, has anybody
balked at the idea of bringing more equity to the table to help re-margin these loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No. So the reason why they're in special mention, there is some weaknesses as Tim Bruckner said. But also,
there's a spirit of cooperation that they want to get to a positive outcome that will either require re-margining or
restructuring in some way, shape or form. What's interesting, maybe we'll leave you with this fun fact, Brody, our
average LTV is about 55%. We're a low advanced rate lender, so on our $2.3 billion of CRE, all-in for the
company, there's about $2 billion of equity in front of us. And so, I'm talking about the whole book and that gives a
lot of motivation for sponsors to sit and work with us in the assets that have been moved into special mention.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Yeah, just given how proactive it is and it sounds like the borrowers are willing to kind of meet you
there, to me, again, it sounds like maybe special mention loans will be heading lower and classified loans heading
lower into the year end, but I guess we'll watch that going forward. Thanks for taking the questions, guys.

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I mean, this is something we're just going to always evaluate, so based upon kind of where we are. But with the
$1.8 billion, it's queued up, it's marked and we'll see how it goes. But most of that we expect to exit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Bernstein/Autonomous
And would you expect the CET1 benefit from that to be proportional to the benefit you saw from the $4 billion of
sales that you've already executed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, I mean, the CET1 elements are – I mean, most of the assets we're talking about are all 100% risk-weighted.
That goes for what's already been done but not all as well as what's in there presently. So, I mean – but at the
same time, I mean, as those loans come off the books, that is beneficial to CET1. Conversely, I mean, I think the
industry is looking at a special charge probably this quarter to recapitalize the insurance fund related to the
demise of those three institutions. So that'll be a – that'll be some charge. That'll be maybe 10 basis points against
our capital growth in Q3 as presently proposed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Bernstein/Autonomous
Sure. And lastly, you talked about laying the groundwork for eventually crossing the $100 billion asset mark. I
guess you're just continuing to build $2 billion of deposits a quarter; that's a $8 billion a year. From $32 billion to
$100 billion would take you about four years from now; that seems very proactive. What do we need to see to
take up your – the growth targets and growth goals before that if you were going to hit that mark any sooner?
What would give you comfort to open the growth back up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So let me just give some color commentary about being very early. I think what you're going to see is supervisory
review from the regulators starting much earlier and holding you to a higher standard well before $100 billion. So
the process isn't, A, you hit $100 billion, you're going to be reviewed differently. The process starts well before
that, that are you ready to cross over $100 billion, and that starts before that. That would be my just color
commentary on how that review process works and why we're building it. In terms of opening the gates, I think our
growth is going to be determined by our deposits and our growth in deposits. And we have traditionally been a
little bit more heavier-weighted to the left side of the balance sheet which we can turn that machine on, and we're
really good at growing loans. Well, we've turned around and said wait a minute, we need to have a more holistic
relationship with our client base, and growing the deposits are critical obviously to our future growth.
And investing in future deposit channels and the deposit channels that we've talked about here today, that will
drive the deposit growth in the future. So we said $2 billion last quarter that we thought we'd grow deposits; we
came in at $3.5 billion. Yes, there was a lot of brokered in there. This quarter, we say $2 billion without brokered
and we're going to try to exceed and do better than that, and then we'll kind of grow our way into 2024.
