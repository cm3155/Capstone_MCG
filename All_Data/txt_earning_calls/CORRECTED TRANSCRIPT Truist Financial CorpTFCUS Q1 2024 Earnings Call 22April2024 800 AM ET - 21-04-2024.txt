William Henry Rogers
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. But before we discuss our first quarter
results, let's begin, as always, with purpose. We see that on slide 4. Truist is a purpose-driven company dedicated
to inspiring and building better lives and communities, and I'd like to share some of the ways we brought purpose
to life last quarter. Our focus on small business heroes is a great example of purpose driving performance. This
strategy helps community heroes achieve their financial dreams and elevates their ability to support our neighbors
and build strong communities.
We're seeing great success with small business, evidenced by the addition of nearly 8,600 small business
accounts during the quarter and $700 million worth of deposits. Our Truist Community Capital team committed
more than $252 million to support over 1,600 units of affordable housing, over 3,000 new jobs, and projects that
will help empower almost 400,000 people in underserved communities over the next three years.
Additionally, we announced the initial recipients of grants from the Truist Community Catalyst Initiative, which is a
three-year Community Reinvestment Act program aimed at four key focus areas, affordable housing, small
business access to capital, workforce development, and essential community services. There are 17 community
organizations receiving grants that will be used to support efforts in 54 communities across 13 states and allow
local non-profit organizations to better respond to critical community needs within their states.
Lastly, we published our 2023 Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report this month, which I encourage
you to read and learn more about our progress in building better lives and communities. In all of these examples,
our core belief is evident, we're leaders in banking and we're unwavering in care. All right, so let's turn to some of
our key takeaways on slide 6.
First, I need to state and remind everyone that our first quarter and for the previous periods have been restated to
reflect the pending sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. This change has no impact on our net income available to
common shareholders. The restatement does remove TIH's revenue and expense from our financial statements
as net income from TIH is now being reported as net income from discontinued operation. Mike's going to provide
a lot more details around that later in the call.
On an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion, or $0.90 a share,
which excludes a $0.04 per share impact from the industrywide FDIC special assessment and a $0.05 per share
impact from the acceleration of incentive compensation at TIH due to the pending sale. Pre-tax restructuring
charges of $70 million negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.04 per share. So despite a few discrete items in
the quarter, we're pleased with our underlying results.
As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we saw a significant
increase in investment banking and trading revenue driven by strong performance across much of our capital
markets platform, with particular strength in M&A and equity capital markets. Loan demand continues to remain
relatively muted, though we did see some improvement in our commercial lending pipelines during the quarter.
On the consumer side, we recalibrated several of the capital conserving strategies we deployed last year prior to
3

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2024
announcing the sale of TIH. This resulted in an increase in loan applications, and in March we saw the first
increase in balances since October of 2022.
Second, our results show our expense discipline and continued focus on managing cost. As a result of these
efforts, adjusted expenses increased by less than 1% linked-quarter and decreased by 4% on a year-over-year
basis. Although the linked-quarter rate of expense growth will increase in the second quarter relative to the first,
we are fully committed to delivering our expense objectives in 2024, which, excluding TIH, should now result in
adjusted expenses remaining approximately flat in 2024 versus 2023.
Third, asset quality continues to normalize off historically low levels, but we're pleased that nonperforming loans
remain relatively stable and the net charge-offs were within our expectations. Finally, during the quarter, we also
announced that we'll sell our remaining stake in Truist Insurance Holdings, which is on track to close in the
second quarter. Sale of TIH will significantly strengthen our relative capital position, which will create substantial
capacity for growth in our core banking businesses.
In addition, as we discussed in February, a stronger capital position affords us an opportunity to evaluate a variety
of capital deployment opportunities post-closing, including a potential balance sheet repositioning designed to at
least replace TIH earnings. Sale of TIH also positions us to resume share repurchases. The timing and size of
repurchase activity will depend on our ongoing capital planning, market conditions, clarity around final capital
rules and other factors, but our goal is to resume a program that's both meaningful and durable.
Before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss our financial performance in more detail, I want to provide a quick
update on the progress we're making in improving experiences for our clients, which we see on slide 7. We
continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities. In the first quarter of 2024, mobile app users
grew 8% and digital transactions increased 13% compared to the first quarter of last year.
Through activating teammates to educate clients on our capabilities, transactions continue to shift towards self-
service capabilities, with 77% of deposits occurring through these channels, primarily driven by strong growth in
Zelle transactions. Recently, we rolled out Zelle QR code widget where users where users can quickly access
their QR codes from their home screens to seamlessly assist with bank transfers. At Truist, we aim to make
banking simple and easy for our clients through thoughtful enhancements to their experience.
Enhanced offerings coupled with strong growth in digital have resulted in higher retail digital client satisfaction
scores. These scores surpassed premerger highs as we continue to focus on accelerated adoption and efficiency
using our T3 strategy. Overall, I'm proud of the continued momentum Truist is making in digital and optimistic
about the opportunity to expand our digital user base and drive self-service transaction volume.
So, with Mike â€“ and with that, Mike, let me turn it over to you to discuss our financial results in a little more detail.

Michael B. Maguire
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, our financial statements for the first quarter and
for previous periods have been restated due to the pending sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. This restatement
has no impact on our net income or earnings per share for historical or current reporting periods. However, as you
can see in our financial tables, revenue and expense associated with TIH is no longer shown on our financial
statements.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2024
TIH's contribution to Truist net income and earnings per share is now captured in net income from discontinued
operations. My comments today will focus on revenue and expense from continuing operations, although I will
also provide some detail on revenue and expense for the quarter inclusive of TIH for comparative purposes.
We reported net income available from continuing operations of $1 billion, or $0.76 per share, which includes a
$75 million pre-tax or $0.04 per share after-tax expense related to the industrywide FDIC special assessment. We
reported net income available from discontinued operations, which represents earnings from TIH, of $64 million,
or $0.05 per share, which includes an $89 million pre-tax or $0.05 per share negative impact from the
acceleration of incentive compensation at TIH due to the pending sale.
So, on an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion, or $0.90 per
share, which includes adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.80 and adjusted net income from
discontinued operations of $0.10. In addition to the items I just noted, we also had pre-tax restructuring charges
totaling $70 million in the quarter which negatively impacted adjusted EPS to common shareholders by $0.04 per
share. The bulk of these charges were related to severance and real estate rationalization.
Total revenue, which excludes revenue associated with TIH, decreased by 1.4% linked-quarter due to a decline in
net interest income, partially offset by stronger noninterest income led by investment banking and trading.
Revenue before the impact of discontinued operations accounting increased 0.2% on a linked-quarter basis.
Adjusted expenses, which excludes adjusted expense associated with TIH, increased by 0.7%. Adjusted
expenses before the impact of discontinued operations accounting increased 1% on a linked-quarter basis.
Next, I'll cover loans and leases on slide 9. Average loans decreased 1.3% sequentially, reflecting overall weaker
client demand and our decision to deemphasize certain lending activities during 2023 which impacted growth
during the first quarter. Average commercial loans decreased 0.9%, primarily due to a 1.2% decrease in C&I
balances, due mostly to lower client demand. In our consumer portfolio, average loans decreased 2%, primarily
due to further reductions in indirect auto and mortgage.
During the quarter, we did increase our appetite for high-quality indirect auto loans, which, as Bill mentioned,
resulted in consumer loan balances showing positive growth for the month of March. Overall, we expect average
loan balances to decline modestly in the second quarter, albeit at a slower pace than the first quarter.
Moving to deposit trends on slide 10, average deposits decreased 1.6% sequentially as growth in client time
deposits and interest checking was more than offset by declines in noninterest-bearing, brokered and money
market balances. Approximately $1.9 billion of the $6.3 billion linked-quarter decline in average deposits was due
to lower brokered deposits. Adjusting for brokered deposits, our average deposits declined approximately 1%.
Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 4.9% and represented 28% of total deposits compared to 29% in the
fourth quarter of 2023.
During the quarter, consumers continued to seek higher rate alternatives which drove an increase in deposit
costs. Specifically, total deposit costs increased 11 basis points sequentially to 2.03%, which resulted in a 2%
increase in our cumulative total deposit beta to 38%. Similarly, interest-bearing deposit costs increased 11 basis
points sequentially to 2.82%, which also resulted in a 2% increase in our cumulative total interest-bearing deposit
beta of 53%.
Looking at net interest income and net interest margin on slide 11, for the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest
income decreased by 4.2% linked-quarter primarily due to higher rate paid on deposits, lower day count in the
5

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2024
quarter, and lower average earning assets. Reported net interest margin declined 7 basis points on a linked-
quarter basis due primarily to higher rate paid on deposits.
Turning to noninterest income on slide 12, noninterest income increased $83 million or 6.1% relative to the fourth
quarter. The linked-quarter increase was primarily attributable to higher investment banking and trading income,
which was up $158 million linked-quarter due to strong results across much of our entire capital markets platform,
with specific strength in M&A and equity capital markets. Lending-related fees decreased $57 million linked-
quarter due to lower leasing-related gains. Noninterest income increased 1.8% on a like-quarter basis as higher
investment banking and trading, wealth, and other income were partially offset by lower service charges on
deposit and mortgage banking income.
Next, I'll cover noninterest expense on slide 13. GAAP expenses of $3 billion decreased $6.6 billion linked-quarter
as fourth quarter 2023 expenses were negatively impacted by a $6.1 billion goodwill impairment charge, a $507
million FDIC special assessment, and $155 million of restructuring charges primarily related to our cost savings
initiatives. Excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization, adjusted noninterest expense
increased 0.7% sequentially. The increase in adjusted expense was driven by higher personnel expense of $156
million due to normal seasonal factors and higher variable incentive compensation.
Partially offsetting the increase in personnel expense were lower other expenses, which declined $82 million,
reflecting lower operating charge-offs and lower pension expense. Adjusted noninterest expenses before the
impact of discontinued operations accounting increased 1% on a linked-quarter basis. On a like-quarter basis,
adjusted expenses declined $120 million or 4.2%, reflecting lower head count and continued expense discipline.
Moving to asset quality on slide 14, asset quality metrics continued to normalize in the first quarter but overall
remain manageable. Nonperforming loans remained relatively stable linked-quarter while total delinquencies were
down 6 basis points sequentially, driven by a 7-basis-point decline in loans 30 to 89 days past due. Included in
our Appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which is virtually unchanged at 1.7% of total loans; however,
we did increase our reserve on this portfolio from 8.5% to 9.3% during the quarter to reflect continued stress in
the sector. We expect stress to remain in the office sector but believe that the size of our office portfolio is
manageable and well reserved. Approximately 5.5% of our office portfolio is currently classified as nonperforming,
but 89% of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan.
During the quarter, our net charge-offs increased 7 basis points to 64 basis points. The increase in net charge-
offs for the quarter reflects increases in our CRE and consumer portfolios offset by lower C&I and CRE
construction losses. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.56%, up 2 basis points sequentially and 19 basis points on a
year-over-year basis due to ongoing credit normalization and stress in the office sector. Consistent with our
commentary last quarter, we've tightened our risk appetite in select areas though we maintain our through-the-
cycle supportive approach for high-quality, long-term clients.
Turning now to capital on slide 15, Truist's CET1 ratio remained relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis at
10.1% as organic capital generation and the impact of lower risk-weighted assets were mostly offset by the
impact of the CECL phase-in that occurred during the quarter. We still anticipate the sale of TIH will generate
approximately 230 basis points of CET1 under current rules and 255 basis points of CET1 capital under proposed
Basel III Endgame rules. It will also increase our tangible book value per share by 33% through a combination of
a $4.8 billion after-tax gain and the deconsolidation of $4.7 billion of goodwill and intangibles from our balance
sheet.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2024
The divestiture of TIH has a 255-basis-point positive impact under fully proposed phase-in Basel III Endgame
rules, which is 25 basis points higher than under current rules. The larger impact on our CET1 ratio under the
proposed rules is due to the reduction in certain threshold deductions due to the overall higher level of capital
from selling TIH. The sale of TIH accelerates our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the
industry and, importantly, creates capacity for Truist to evaluate a wide variety of capital deployment alternatives,
including growing our core banking franchise during a time when much of the industry is conserving capital,
repositioning our balance sheet, and resuming share repurchases.
As it relates to a possible repositioning, recognizing securities, losses under proposed Basel III rules would have
no impact Jon our fully phased-in CET1 ratio since current proposed rules include AOCI in the calculation.
Moreover, any decision to sell market value securities has no impact on our tangible book value per share.
I will now review our updated guidance on slide 16. First, all of my comments today related to second quarter and
full year 2024 guidance exclude any benefit from interest income that Truist will earn on the $10.1 billion of after-
tax cash proceeds that we expect to receive from the pending sale of TIH. Our guidance also excludes any impact
from a potential balance sheet repositioning that we plan to evaluate post-closing. In addition, revenue and
expense guidance for the second quarter and full year 2024 is based on revenue and expense from continuing
operations and does not include any contribution from TIH in previous or in future periods.
Looking into the second quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to decline about 2% from 1Q 2024 GAAP revenue of
$4.9 billion. Net interest income is likely to be down 2% to 3% in the second quarter due to continued pressure on
rate paid and a smaller balance sheet. We expect noninterest income to remain relatively stable on a linked-
quarter basis.
Adjusted expenses of $2.7 billion in the first quarter are expected to increase 4% in Q2 due to higher professional
fees, some timing of projects delayed from Q1, higher marketing costs, and annual merit increases. For the full
year 2024, we previously expected revenues to be down 1% to 3%, which would have included revenue from
Truist Insurance Holdings. If we had excluded revenue from Truist Insurance Holdings from our outlook, our
expectation would have been closer to down 3% to down 5% in 2024. Today, we are tightening our previous
revenue guidance adjusted for TIH of down approximately 3% to down 5% to now down approximately 4% to 5%
to reflect the latest interest rate outlook and continued pressure on deposit mix partially offset by sour improved
outlook for noninterest income.
Our outlook assumes three reductions in the Fed Funds rate with the first reduction coming in June 2024.
Previously, we assumed five reductions in the Fed Funds rate with the first reduction occurring in May 2024. We
still assume that net interest income will trough in the second quarter of 2024 and modestly improve in the second
half of the year. Fewer than three rate reductions would add pressure to our NII outlook and result in our annual
revenue coming in at the lower end of our range for revenue to be down 4% to 5%.
As a reminder, our second quarter and full-year revenue outlook excludes any benefit from interest income
earned on the cash proceeds from the sale of TIH or the benefit of potential balance sheet repositioning. As Bill
mentioned, we still expect the sale of TIH to be completed during the second quarter.
We previously expected our expenses to remain flat or to increase by 1% in 2024, which included expenses
associated with Truist Insurance Holdings. If we had excluded expected expenses from Truist Insurance Holdings
from our outlook, our expectation would equate to expenses remaining approximately flat in 2024. Consistent with
our previous expense outlook adjusted for TIH, we expect full-year 2024 adjusted expenses to remain
approximately flat over 2023 adjusted expenses of $11.4 billion.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2024
In terms of asset quality, we continue to expect net charge-offs of about 65 basis points in 2024. Finally, we
expect our effective tax rate to approximate 16% or 19% on a taxable equivalent basis. Our estimated tax rate
excludes any impact from the gain on the sale of TIH or potential balance sheet repositioning that we might
consider following the sale.
So, now I'll turn it back to Bill for some final remarks.

William Henry Rogers
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Mike.
I am proud of the results our teammates delivered during the first quarter, which included solid underlying
earnings, improved momentum, and the announced sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. As Mike mentioned, TIH
will enter its partnership with its new investors with strong momentum as evidenced by its first quarter results.
Providing risk advice to our clients is core to our purpose, and we look forward to maintaining a strong partnership
with that team into the future.
We have great confidence in our capability to grow our core banking business and help our clients achieve
financial success by delivering our commercial, consumer, payments, investment banking, and wealth platform
through our existing footprint and specialty areas.
Our top priorities for 2024 are unchanged and include growing and deepening relationships with core clients,
maintaining our expense discipline, evaluating various capital deployment options following the sale of TIH, and
enhancing Truist's digital experience through T3 all while maintaining and strengthening strong risk controls and
asset quality metrics. Our expense discipline is showing up in our results, which gives us confidence that we'll
meet our expense objectives this year.
I'm also encouraged by the improvement in our wholesale banking business, which includes investment banking
and trading, as it was a key driver of our quarterly results. In investment banking, we've increased our market
share across several capital market products due to significant investment in talent and industry verticals. These
investments have resulted in significant increase in the number of lead roles across several products, including
equity capital markets, leveraged finance, asset securitization, and M&A. In addition, our mindshare with clients in
our key industry verticals has never been stronger. And we continue to expand into new verticals that are primed
for growth as capital markets activities recover.
We're seeing solid year-over-year growth in referral revenue from commercial banking as we continue to deliver
value-added advice and capabilities to our clients. Our commercial teammates have responded to new
expectations, and we continue to add great talent to our comprehensive platform.
Finally, we made new key leadership hires within our payments business during the quarter as this is an area
where we see significant opportunity for growth over time. In consumer, I'm encouraged that our internal
consumer satisfaction scores have returned to premerger levels. In addition, net new checking account production
was positive in the first quarter as we added 30,000 new consumer and business accounts. Importantly, we're
also seeing year-over-year improvement in account attrition rates.
Also, during the first quarter, our digital channel, we acquired 172,000 accounts including 63,000 new to Truist
while also seeing a 14% increase in deposit balances over the fourth quarter of 2023. While the branch network
8

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2024
represents opportunity for further efficiency in certain markets, we continue to see improvements in productivity
due to teammate execution and investments in technology. We're encouraged by this increased productivity. We'll
look to make investments in branches and select key growth markets in 2025.
Overall, loan demand does remain muted, but I'm encouraged by the improvement in our commercial loan
pipelines and the growth we witnessed in consumer balances late in the first quarter. By selling TIH, we'll have
capital capacity to play more offense in our consumer and wholesale businesses, which includes seeking ways to
accelerate loan growth in our core franchise. In addition, our significantly stronger balance sheet will be positioned
to weather an even wider range of economic environments while also giving us the unique ability to evaluate a
variety of capital deployment opportunities post-closing, including a potential balance sheet repositioning and
resuming meaningful share repurchases later in the year.
Although we have a plan to replace TIH earnings in the near term, we recognize that our increased level of capital
will result in near-term dilution to our return on average tangible common equity ratio. Our starting point for our
ROATCE following the sale of TIH will be exactly that, a starting point. The strength of our markets, our core
banking franchise, our capital deployment options we can consider after the sale will result in improved returns
over time. We'll move with pace but we'll not be in a rush to deploy capital to meet short-term expectations that
don't have a long-term positive impact on our company, our clients, our shareholders, especially since Basel III
capital rules have not been firmly established for the industry.
So, in conclusion, we're off to a solid start in 2024, but we acknowledge, as always, there's more work to do as we
strive to produce better results in the future. We view our first quarter performance as another step forward in that
direction. I'm optimistic about our future. I look forward to operating our company from this increased position of
financial strength in some of the best markets in the country.
And finally, I'd like to thank all of our teammates and our leaders for their incredible, purposeful focus and
productivity, particularly over the last few months during this important time for both TIH and for Truist.
So, with that, Brad, let me hand it back over to you for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions] We'll pause momentarily to assemble the roster. And our first question today comes from John
McDonald from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Great. Thank you. Good morning. I was wondering how the rate environment changes, if at all, the ability and
willingness to deploy through the restructuring of the securities book. Mike, maybe you could just comment.
Higher rates presumably achieving that neutral impact gets a little bit easier, does that affect how much you might
do? And maybe, Bill, could you just make some broader comments about the options you'll have to deploy
organically in buybacks and other things. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, John, for the question. Look, I mean, we're certainly taking a look at the market rate environment.
And I'd say just the framework that we shared back in February, we remain committed to, right? And so, we laid
out a set of objectives that spanned maintaining a relative capital position, at least replacing the earnings from
TIH. We also have ambitions around advancing our liquidity and ALM position. So, the rate environment, when we
talked about that in February, is a touch different than what we're looking at today, but we think still actionable.
And so, our plans to evaluate a repositioning after we complete the sale are still intact.
I mean, if you look at the short end of the curve, certainly we see probably a little bit of benefit relative to what we
talked about from a cash reinvestment perspective. And the same goes if you think about reinvestment rates on
the bonds. But, on the other hand, you do have the trade-off of a slightly higher realized loss in that instance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
And then, I'll go to the others. And, as you said, John, I mean, we're in a different rate environments. We'll
evaluate all the other alternatives that exist with that, and there's some things that have some shorter paybacks
that I think should be evaluated in that alternative. And then also, we have some tax efficiency as it relates to this.
So, we have some unique components of doing this in line with the TIH sale.
And then you mentioned sort of one of the other capital deployment options. Obviously, the first and foremost [ph]
for us (00:31:13) is growth in our business, I mean, sort of investing in our business. You saw in this quarter some
of the things we did on the consumer side where we leaned in a little bit. Quite frankly, we think some of the
margins are still strong in those businesses, so that what we're adding is a little more accretive than it would have
been in the past. The risk profile is strong. So, we have the capacity to dial some of that up on the consumer side.
And then, on the wholesale side, just our relevance is more important. So, we don't want to give up all the
discipline. We created a lot of discipline around pricing and around structure, and, again, what we're adding today
is much more accretive. So, we'll continue to pursue opportunities in our markets and through our industry
verticals, and we've got a good momentum in that front.

And then lastly, on the share repurchase side, we'll be back in the share repurchase business. That'll be part of
the portfolio. As I mentioned before, we're going to do all this with pace. So, I think it would be reasonable to
assume we'll have some type of meaningful share repurchase, sort of short, medium-term, and then longer-term,
and just a more durable, consistent share repurchase plan.
So, it's a combination of all those things factored into the equation, which give us, as I said before, a lot of
optimism about being able to improve those returns, short-term, importantly, but, most importantly, over the long-
term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
That's really helpful. Thanks. And maybe as a quick follow-up, we saw a really strong investment banking results
this quarter. How much of that is good environment versus payback on some of the investments you've made in
that business? And maybe just comment on what's packed into your outlook for the second quarter there, Mike.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, I mean, a lot of it obviously is from market improvement. But as you noted, I mean, we've been
investing in this business for quite some time, particularly over the last several years. Our existing team is really
sort of rising to the challenge. They're working really great with the commercial team, so we're seeing all the pull-
through from our franchise. We've brought 30-plus new MDs into our business. So, these are teammates with
great expertise and great access.
So, I think it's a combination of all those things and we're really confident. I mean, we're confident headed into the
second quarter and the rest of the year about the momentum in this business.

Oh, hey, thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Great to hear your voice.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks so much, Bill, really appreciate it. So, I did just want to lean in on the loan side, a couple of comments in
the prepared remarks that you made. One was on commercial lending pipelines building, and I wanted to
understand is this a change? And â€“ I mean, we often hear about pipelines in the investment banking side, not as
much on the commercial lending side. And I wanted to understand your thoughts around what execution on that
requires. Is it lower rates? Is it customers building more inventory or just some color on that would be really
helpful? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. And I did note it because it's a little bit different. So, in the fourth quarter, we started seeing pipelines
decrease a little bit. And here in the first quarter, we've seen pipelines improve particularly on the commercial
side.
How they get to execution and how they get to finalization will depend a lot on market conditions. But the good
news is clients are â€“ they're having the discussions, they're having the debate about the new warehouse or the
new fleet of trucks or the things that they want to do to continue to expand their businesses. But, most
importantly, we're just more relevant. I mean, we're just more relevant in those discussions. I mean, the activity
that we've been able to create in terms of new relationships, I mean, almost 60% of the activity that we added in
the quarter were new relationships, so new to Truist.
So, I think a lot of [ph] it had pitched (00:35:36) activities up. All the things we're doing, new left leads are up. So, I
think it's some combination of a little bit of the markets that we operate, probably a little more optimistic than the
rest of the country, our investments that we've made, products, capabilities, and our overall relevance with our
clients. So, we're talking to them about things they want to listen to, they want to talk about, and I think we're just
better positioned than we've ever been.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So, then the follow-up is on the auto side. You mentioned that you're leaning into indirect high quality. So, I
just wanted to understand, what does high-quality indirect autos mean to you? And then, the relevance to
corporate clients increasing. Is that a function of balance sheet size or a product mix or maybe if you could just
[audio gap] (00:36:29). I know I squeezed in two, but it was a follow-up plus a follow-up. Thanks.

Okay. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
...for a few more. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So, on the auto side, maybe to compare and contrast, it's not rack for us.
It's sort of our core prime auto business in terms of growth. And, again, just being able to be a little more relevant
to our dealers and creating a little more capacity. You've seen lots of changes from people in and out of the auto
side. We like the consistency of it and again we have deep, strong relationships with lots of dealers, and this just
adds to that portfolio.
And then, on the corporate side, same thing on the â€“ if the question was related to the risk profile. Similar kind of
risk profile. I mean, we created, as I said, a lot of discipline over the last year in terms â€“ so we were optimizing
capital and we want to continue to do that. So, the same expectations that we have for full relationships, the same
expectations we have for the risk profile. So, I think everything we're adding is just more accretive than what we
were adding before based on our capabilities.

Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Let's see. Mike, wanted to just ask a little on the guide
and the nuance. So, if I understood it correctly, on an apples-to-apples basis, the full-year guide is the same for
expenses, but tightened up to the low end of a prior range as better fees are offset by slightly weaker NII outlook.
So, hopefully, I got that right. But within there, just curious for expanded thoughts on what has changed within the
NII expectations. I imagine the preponderance of it is just fewer rate cut expectations with the three versus six
previously. But maybe you could speak to other factors such as deposit mix or pricing nuance that might have
impacted as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Scott, you made it easy for me. Those are the answers. So, for us, we had five cuts back in January. I think
the market had six. We're looking now at three. I think the market has two or fewer, frankly. And so, I think maybe
one nuance to our outlook is that we believe that sort of 4% to 5% manages three cuts or even fewer cuts than
three. So, perhaps worth noting there. And then, beyond just the curve, we have just â€“ and I think our expectation
in January, we were six months from the last hike and here we now sit at nine months, and we probably had an
expectation that there'd be a touch less churn and pressure on pricing and mix on the liabilities portfolio side.
So, those are the two factors. And then, of course we're seeing some strength from a fee side, so put that on the
blender and 4% to 5% feels right.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Totally understand. Thank you. And then, Mike, maybe just on sort of the competitive environment for
funding. On the one hand, it's a general question, but also curious to hear your thoughts insofar as there are a lot
of out-of-market competitors encroaching on pretty attractive demographic markets. So, just curious to hear just
your thoughts on sort of rationality of [ph] funding and pricing (00:40:00). Are they having a visible impact or is the
market pretty rational as to what you would expect in a higher for longer environment? How are those things all
trajecting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, look, one of the benefits of operating in such attractive high-growth markets is, is they're attractive
to others as well, and so it's always been a competitive marketplace for us, but I don't think we're seeing what I
would describe as irrational behavior in the market. I think we're at a little unusual moment in the cycle being as
high as we are for as long as we've been here. And so you're seeing a variety of strategies, but by and large, I
think people are all trying to solve the same problem we are, which is when will we perhaps see some relief on
the rate side?
Meanwhile, we're really just focused on supporting our clients, right? And so we've got the right products, we
think, and the right client experiences, and we're going to pay a competitive rate to defend the relationships that
you would expect us to defend.

Yeah. It's also, Scott, why we focus on net new. So in addition to sort of the pricing within our existing portfolio, we
want to make sure we're adding net new accounts. So, our rate of acquisition has been really strong and our rate

Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, thanks, guys. Just wondering, just in terms of sequencing and how we'll understand how the rest of the
potential benefits look like following the close of the transaction, I guess just wondering, are you still anticipating a
June 1 close? And then do you anticipate like just next earning season, we'll kind of get the understanding of the
full impacts of both cash reinvestment and whatever you may decide to do on restructuring?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, hey. Good morning, Ken, it's Mike. We don't have a date certain on closing but we have increasing
confidence that Q2 we will be able to complete the transaction. I think once we complete the transaction, we think
there'll be an opportunity for us to communicate during the quarter sort of what things look like from there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, got it. And then just underneath the surface, I guess it's hard because by 3Q you'll probably have done
some of these things, but you mentioned NII down a little bit in the second quarter. Ex the deal, do you have a
view of kind of where that core NII would be heading as we look into the second half of the year and kind of when
that gets to stability point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, that's right. And the guide we gave for Q2 is sort of ex any cash or ex any potential benefit from a
repositioning, so that down 2% to 3% is I think what you're asking for, at least in the quarter. And we do believe
that the second quarter will be a trough for us. So, if you think about the third quarter, A, I think we'll get a touch of
benefit just on the â€“ A, our baseline, has us getting a cut in June, and if you think about the third quarter, maybe a
cut and a half if you get September, early September also.
So, you got a cut and a half, you've got one extra day in the third quarter, and maybe a touch of a larger balance
sheet if we start to see a little bit of loan growth come through. So we see some modest improvement in Q3 and
the same in Q4 sort of a baseline path. I think fewer cuts puts a little bit of pressure on that, but I think we still
expect 2Q to be a trough from an NII perspective regardless.

Ken Usdin Q

Thank you, on kind of how it improves. Okay, and then just one more follow-up on IB. You mentioned the
investments you've been making at the quarter was outstandingly good. Are you kind of implying that flat fees in
the second quarter, that this is a new run rate for IB and trading? Some other banks have talked about pull
forward in DCM but just want to kind of understand the color, where you think the puts and takes are for fee
income growth from here? And thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, I don't think there's been any particular pull forward. This was a particularly strong M&A quarter. M&A is a
little less predictable on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but I think as we look sort of â€“ if we're thinking short term
like next quarter, next couple of quarters, I mean, this seems to be a pace that we're operating at right now in
terms of our momentum and pipelines.

Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, if I can just get one simple question and one more complex question. The simple question is, so you're guiding
for a trough in NII in second quarter and that does not include any deployment of the $10 billion. So, if you just put
the $10 billion, say, you get a 5% yield on that, then you get $500 million, that would add 2% to your year-over-
year revenue growth. And also how much would the sale of Insurance improve your tangible book value?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
The first question, that's right, Mike, the guidance really for the year end, specifically, you asked for the quarter,
does not include the benefit of the cash. We do expect the cash proceeds after tax to be about $10.1 billion. You
can pick your forward curve deployment rate but I think you're in the ballpark. And your second question was,
what would be the tangible book value per share improvement for the sale, I think was the question. That would
be by roughly a third.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, Bill, for you, I know I brought this up before, but we're â€“ after five years, the announcement of
this merger, and at least five years ago as of today, your stock is down one-fourth; the [ph] BKX (00:46:06) is flat;
the S&P is up two-thirds; and I'm looking â€“ I guess your Annual Meeting is tomorrow and you talk about leaning
into your purpose, inspiring to build better lives, and I just don't see the word shareholder there or on that.
By the way, I love purpose-driven capitalism and I love how you bring that up, but I think if you don't bring
shareholders along on that side, you say happiness, I don't think the shareholders are too happy if they've been
around for the last five years. So can you just pull the lens back a day before your Annual Shareholders' Meeting
and say what you're doing to help make shareholders happy assuming that your clients, employees and
communities are happy? How do you bring the shareholders along a little bit more? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Mike. So just to be clear in our mission statement, our shareholders are a key component of our
stakeholders. So, they've never been excluded in terms of our purpose, and I just fundamentally believe that
purpose and performance are inextricably linked, so there â€“ just no doubt about that. Did we lean in a lot to clients
and teammates and communities during the first part of our merger and during COVID? Absolutely. Are we
leaning in equally now with shareholders as component of all that? Absolutely, and you see some of the actions
we're taking, some of the momentum that we're creating.
I highlighted in the beginning of this call sort of small business as an example of how purpose and performance
are linked. So, focus on our small business community heroes, which is great, that's very purposeful, help them
build their businesses and help them build their communities, but also meant we added 8,600 of them and we
created $700 million of deposits. So, I do think they're linked. I think if you sat in our company and listened, you
would understand that people make the connection very, very clearly, and I'm not confused about that. And I think
the actions that we've taken in the fall, the actions that we're taking now, the momentum we've created are solid
evidence of our focus on our shareholders as well.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
...maybe just, Bill, following up on â€“ from a shareholder focus, I think there's a lot of focus around what this
company can earn on a go-forward basis as we think about return on tangible equity. Maybe you want to wait for
a few months, I appreciate that till the deal closes, but give us a sense, when you look at sort of consensus
numbers, 12% return on tangible equity, I'm assuming that's not kind of what you're aspiring for. So, give us a
framework, when we think about your peer set, whether you think you can get there and then just how quickly
given maybe there's still some more tech spend to be undertaken over the next few years. Yeah, if you could start
there. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Ebrahim, I think I've hopefully said very clearly that that'd be a starting point. So, that would not be an
acceptable return for us long term. It is a component of a reset. If you think about it, there are â€“ let me put it into a
couple buckets. So short and medium term, we have a chance to actually move that more demonstrably. So think
about the securities repositioning sort of as a step one and share repurchase a little more meaningful to start with
and more durable over time.
So we have a short- and medium-term unique capacity to increase that, and then long term has to come from the
growth of our business. And we're in the best markets, we're creating momentum. In all the segments of our
market, we're creating a lot of efficiency. So, every dollar of revenue is going to be more efficient in terms of how it
produces income for our shareholders over time and our ability to continue to invest. So, you mentioned
technology, but all those will be components.
So the expenses are related to also our capacity to save money and invest in our company long term. So, short
and medium term, we increase the slope a little bit; and then long term, increase the slope over time. It's a little
too early for a sort of a specific target. The target right now is to grow, and again grow meaningfully. As we
understand the capital rules a little bit better, get through some of the capital planning, we'll be in a better position
to talk about more longer-term targets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And, Mike, just quick one for you. So, it sounds like fewer rate cuts is negative, but at the same time, the
cash will make the balance sheet asset sensitive. With the cash â€“ I mean, I'm just wondering if we have to â€“ if we
were to assume there are no rate cuts this year, is that really negative or more a neutral scenario given the cash
will be sort of earning higher for longer in that backdrop? If you could clarify that, thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, well, Ebrahim, what I was talking about was sort of a continuing ops guide, so ex the incremental cash.
So, we feel like there'll be downside, right, so our 4% to 5% contemplates three cuts baseline but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yes.

...fewer cuts as well to the low side. I think if you added the cash, you're right, that would add asset sensitivity and
that would just sort of transform our NII trajectory broadly. Obviously, when that asset sensitivity comes onto the
balance sheet, we'll manage that, consistent with how we've managed rate risk in the past, which is we would
probably add some receivers to manage against lower rates longer. I think I answered your question, which is the
guide is continuing ops ex cash. We think the 4% to 5% has that in the cash and any repositioning benefit would
be on top of that.

question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. What do you think is a good capital level to be running at kind of looking out medium term
including AOCI?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Matt, it's Mike. I'll take a swing at that one. It's one that's tough to get on the record on, as you know, I
think others are probably in the same boat. I think the good news for Truist is we find ourselves, at least once we
get our TIH transaction completed, in a really strong, I think, on a relative and absolute basis capital position. With
the rules still in a proposal stage, I think it's really hard for us to determine exactly what a target might be.
I think we do find ourselves in a position right now of some amount of excess capital, it's impossible to understand
exactly what that level would be. But the good news again is we do have the confidence in our current level such
that we can shift from sort of a phase where we've been conserving capital to a phase where we're deploying
capital and optimizing that capital and putting it to work. And whether that's in the core balance sheet, which
would be our first priority, is to grow client relationships and balances and make money the old-fashion way, we
obviously have been clear that we think there's â€“ we have the capacity to evaluate a repositioning of the balance
sheet.
And, of course, Bill's been pretty direct about our ambitions around buying back stock. So, don't have a target for
you, but our sort of tone and mindset and planning is oriented around growth.

We're at 10.1% as of the end of the quarter, which is flat to last quarter. Obviously, the CECL phase-in impacted
the linked-quarter advancement. And if you fully phased in the proposed rules, our AOCI would I think worsen that
by a little over 3%, the thresholds a little less than 1%, and then RWA inflation maybe a couple, call it, 20, 30
basis points. So I think we're around 5.9%, maybe 6% on a fully phased-in basis today.

Mike, to follow up on the bond potential restructuring, a technical question, are you guys permitted â€“ I know you
can restructure the AFS, available-for-sale portfolio, but can you touch the held-to-maturity portfolio as well? And
second, if this Basel III, as we know, appears to be delayed because of a big change coming, if Basel III doesn't
get solidified and finalized until first or second quarter of next year, how does that impact your guys' decision-
making on when to possibly do this restructuring?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Sure, Gerard. The first question, no, the HTM portfolio wouldn't be eligible for repositioning. We wouldn't be in a
position to sell those securities or the consequences that we would have to mark the rest of the HTM securities. In
terms of Basel, obviously, we've been engaged in the advocacy there as well. We've been monitoring the
20

evolution of the rule. It does seem at this point that a final rule certainly is delayed versus our â€“ what we probably
would have expected a year ago or even six months ago. But I don't think we have an expectation that the
substance of the rule that's going to be most relevant to Truist is likely to change, which is the inclusion of, or the
deduction of AOCI from regulatory capital.
So I think we feel good about our path forward. And look, I mean I think we were pretty clear in February again
around our objectives with a potential repositioning. And just to sort of state it again, I mean, one, whatever we
do, we want to make sure that we still have ample capacity to grow the business and execute on the buyback that
Bill has mentioned. But it's really important to us to at least replace the TIH earnings in whatever we would
contemplate.

Very good. And then possibly a follow-up on the commercial real estate detail you gave us in the Appendix. It
looked like the nonperforming loan percentage declined a bit from the fourth quarter. Charge-offs, however,
obviously went up. Your reserves also went up relative to total loans. Any color that you guys can provide us on
what's happening to the mix of the commercial real estate? Obviously, office is the one that we're all focused on
but any other areas that you guys have some color would be great. Thank you.

Clarke R. Starnes III A
Vice Chair & Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Gerard, this is Clarke. We were very pleased in the quarter. To your point, we did see our total CRE NPLs
go down, and that was driven by deliberate actions we took to continue to work through the stressed exposure in
the CRE office. We actually reduced CRE office $222 million or 4.5% for the quarter while addressing about $230
million worth of maturity. So as we've said before, we're not going to kick the can down the road.
So we're trying to be very intentional about recognizing where we have exposure and going ahead and dealing
with that, and that's what created the higher losses for the quarter, but the trade-off was lower NPLs. To your
point, we also feel very good about our reserves. Our office reserves were increased to 9.3%. And also for the
stressed, more institutional style, we're nearly â€“ we're about 11.8%, so we're well-reserved.
I would say the other CRE segments are holding up really well. I know there's a lot of talk about multifamily. I'd
say for us, what we see there is mostly a migration to the watch list but not to NPL or losses yet and we're
working with those borrowers. And we're quite pleased that most sponsors are coming in and addressing,
resizing, if necessary, interest reserves or other structural ways to keep those performing. So we feel good about
the overall CRE book and our trajectory right now.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2024
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
A couple of quick questions. One is the balance sheet restructuring that you're talking about, any sense of timing
in terms of how long? Do you expect you'd get done by â€“ assuming you close on June 1, do you think you'd get
done by end of this year or you think it ends â€“ heads over into 2025? Are there any sort of tax reasons why you
have any time limitations?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Maybe let me hit that, Mike. So, I mean, the spirit would be simultaneous. So that would be the spirit in terms of
how we would potentially restructure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then as you restructure, Bill, are you thinking you replace the securities with other securities? I know
you're only going to get it to â€“ you want to get earnings to neutral. Where are you at this point in thinking, are you
willing to go more? What do you think in terms of ongoing run rate of securities as a proportion of earning assets?
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Vivek, it's Mike, I'll take it. In February, what we laid out was sort of an even redeployment into cash
and securities. Even that I think was hypothetical when â€“ as you can imagine, we are keeping an eye on the
market and thinking about the trade-offs around different â€“ whether it be mortgages or treasuries and cash. So I
think we'll get that mix right and we'll be guided on not just earnings. Obviously, we have an objective of
shortening the balance sheet and improving our readiness around what we think will be more rigorous liquidity
requirements over time. And so that's actually one of the great benefits of this transaction or this collection of
potential transactions, is it's not just about capital, this really does move us forward more broadly, so.
