Stephen J. Squeri
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Thanks, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. As you
saw in our release this morning, we had another strong quarter. Revenues grew 27% on an FX adjusted basis
and earnings per share was $2.47 up 9% over last year. Our investments to drive customer engagement,
acquisitions, and retention once again generated great results and our credit quality remained strong.
Card Member spending remained at near-record levels in the quarter. Billed business was up 24% on an FX
adjusted basis over the record growth we delivered a year earlier, led by the continued strength in Goods &
Services spending and the ongoing strong rebound in Travel & Entertainment.
As we said earlier this year, we expected the recovery in travel spending to be a tailwind for us, but the strength of
the rebound has exceeded our expectations throughout the year. In the quarter, total T&E spending was up 57%
from a year earlier on an FX adjusted basis, driven by the continued strong demand from consumers and small
business customers. Particularly noteworthy is the strength we're seeing in T&E spending in our international
markets, which exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time this quarter on FX adjusted basis. Business travel
also continued to recover, and overall activity remained strong through September.

Importantly, we're seeing increased customer engagement with the wide range of travel and dining benefits and
services we offer as part of our membership model. For example, bookings through our consumer travel business
reached their highest level since before the pandemic in the third quarter, and in dining, our Resy reservation
platform continues to see strong growth. Since we acquired the platform in 2019, Resy users have tripled to reach
35 million and we quadrupole a number of restaurants available around the world on Resy.
Goods & Services spending grew 16% year-over-year. The continued growth in Goods & Services is supported
by the structural shift to online commerce that was accelerated by the pandemic and has been sustained since
then. The new online and mobile oriented benefits we added to our value propositions. These benefits are
particularly attractive to our Millennial (sic) [Millennials] (00:04:09) and Gen Z customer base, which is our fastest-
growing customer cohort.
The investments we've made in our value propositions are also continuing to drive momentum in new card
acquisitions. We added 3.3 million new proprietary cards during the quarter, our highest quarterly level of
acquisitions since the pandemic began, and we continue to see strong uptake of our premium fee-based products
with acquisitions of US Consumer Platinum and Gold cards, as well as US Business Platinum cards reaching
record quarterly highs.
Millennial (sic) [Millennials] (00:04:40) and Gen Z customers are powering this growth comprising more than 60%
of our proprietary consumer card acquisitions in the quarter. As we sit here today, we see no changes in the
spending behaviors of our customers and our credit metrics continue to be strong with delinquencies and write-
offs remaining at low levels, even as loan balances are steadily rebuilding.
Of course, we are mindful of the mixed signals in the broader economy. As always, we have plans in place to
pivot should the operating environment change dramatically, and we've been taking thoughtful risk management
actions to be prepared in the event of a downturn, but as I've emphasized many times before, we run the
company for the long term and make through-the-cycle investment decisions. Our strong third quarter results
show that our strategy investing in our brand, value propositions, customers, colleagues, technology and
coverage, continues to pay off and our performance is consistent with our long-term growth aspirations. Looking
ahead, we continue to see many great growth opportunities and we will continue to take actions to best position
our business for the long term.
As you'll recall, our international businesses were among the fastest-growing prior to the pandemic, as more
countries relax their cross-border travel policies and life returns to normal, we see tremendous opportunities for
growth in key regions, despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.
To that point, we made an organizational change a few months ago to help seize on these [audio gap] (00:06:12)
we brought together our international consumer, small business and large corporate management teams under
one leader, which will increase our speed, agility, scale and efficiency in our operations outside the US. As a
result, you'll see this quarter, we've introduced a new International Card Services reporting segment.
Looking ahead, we remain confident that the successful execution of our strategy driven by our outstanding
leadership team and the talented colleagues throughout the company positions us well as we seek to achieve our
long-term growth plan aspirations of revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and
beyond. Based on our performance through the third quarter, we also remain confident in our full-year revenue
growth guidance of 23% to 25% and we expect to be above our original full-year EPS guidance range of $9.25 to
$9.65.

With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to provide a detailed overview of our Q3 results.

Jeffrey C. Campbell
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our third quarter results, which
reflect another strong quarter and great progress against our multiyear growth plan. Starting with our summary of
financials on slide 2. Most importantly, our third quarter revenues were $13.6 billion, reaching a record high in the
second quarter in a row up 27% on an FX-adjusted basis.
Now, I would point out that we continue to see a much-stronger US dollar relative to most of the major currencies
in which we operate, so you do see a 300-basis point spread between our FX-adjusted revenue growth of 27%
and our reported revenue growth of 24%, as we absorb some significant foreign-exchange headwinds. Of course,
the overall impact on our earnings still a headwind is less significant because we do have some offsetting positive
impacts on the expense side.
Our revenue performance in the third quarter drove reported net income of $1.9 billion and earnings per share of
$2.47, representing EPS growth of 9% year-over-year, a great result, considering the sizable credit reserve
releases we had in the third quarter last year. Because of these prior-year reserve releases, we have also
included the tax provision income as a supplemental disclosure again this quarter. On this basis, pre-tax provision
income was $3.2 billion up 43% versus the same time period last year, reflecting the growth momentum in our
underlying earnings.
Before getting into a more detailed look at results, let me spend just a minute briefly explaining how we've evolved
our financial reporting for the organizational changes that Steve discussed earlier. You'll see in the disclosures
that [indiscernible] (00:09:16) earnings release at the beginning of this quarter we have moved from three to four
reportable operating segments. We first took Global Consumer Services and split the US into its own segment,
creating US Consumer Services. We then combined the international consumer business with the international
portion of small and medium-size enterprises and large corporate, creating the new International Card Services
segment.
Commercial Services, that includes US SME, US large corporate and select global corporate clients. And lastly,
our Global Merchant and Network Services segment remains largely unchanged, and as always, includes our
global payments network and network partnerships. You will see in the appendix of our disclosures that we have
recast prior periods to conform to these new operating segments. The new segments will also be reflected in our
third quarter Form 10-Q.
Now, let's get into our results beginning with overall volumes. Looking at slides 3 and 4, you can see the
continued strength in our Card Member spending behavior that Steve noted earlier. Total network volumes and
billed business were each up year-over-year at 23% and 24%, respectively, on an FX-adjusted basis in the third
quarter. If you were to compare to 2019, third quarter billed business grew 30%, accelerating above last quarter's
growth rate of 28% relative to 2019, and importantly, despite the uncertainties in the current economic
environment, our spending trends with performance relative to 2019 strengthened as we went through the
quarter. We are really pleased with this growth and the fact you see strong growth across all customer types and
geographies driven by both sustained growth in Goods & Services spending and continued T&E momentum.
On slides 5 through 8 we've given you a variety of views of this strong growth across our US Consumer Services,
Commercial Services and in International Card Services segments, and the various customer types within each.
Starting with our largest segment, billings from our US Consumer customers grew at 22% in the third quarter,
5


American Express Co.
(AXP) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
reflecting the continued strength in spending trends from our premium US consumers. Millennial and Gen Z
customers again drove our highest billed business growth within this segment with their spending growing 39%
year-over-year this quarter.
Turning to Commercial Services. You see that spending from our US SME customers represents the majority of
our billings in the segment and that spending from these customers continued its strong growth up 17% in the
third quarter. Our US large and global corporate customers, though a smaller part of billings in the segment,
remain an important foundation for the entire company, and these customers continued their steady travel
recovery this quarter, though overall billings are still 13% below pre-pandemic levels. We do continue to expect
though that this group will fully recover over time.
And lastly, international consumer and international SME, and large corporate customers within the new
International Card Services segment were amongst our fastest-growing pre-pandemic as Steve said and are now
in a steep recovery mode. You can see our high-levels of growth in Q3 at 34% and 43% year-over-year,
respectively, and if you were also to look at international consumer growth by age cohort, you would see similar to
the US that the highest growth levels are from our Millennial and Gen Z customers who make up an even larger
portion of overall billings than they do in the US.
One other note on overall billings. The majority of our high-level of growth this quarter was again driven by the
number of transactions flowing through our network with some modest impact from inflation. Overall then, we are
pleased with the momentum we see across-the-board in our spending volumes, which is tracking in-line with our
expectations through both the year and for our long-term aspirations.
Now, moving to loan balances on slide 9. We saw year-over-year growth accelerate to 31% in our loan balances,
as well as good sequential growth. The interest-bearing portion of our loan balances also continues to
consistently increase quarter-over-quarter, surpassing 2019 levels in the third quarter as customers steadily
rebuild balances.
As you then turn to credit and provisions on slides 10 through 12, the high credit quality of our customer base
continues to show through in our strong credit performance. Write-off rates for Card Member loans remain well
below pre-pandemic levels, flat to where they have been for the last few quarters, as you can see on slide 10. As
expected, you do now see the delinquency rates for loans have started to modestly pick up but also remain well
below pre-pandemic levels.
Turning now to the accounting for this credit performance on slide 11. As you know, there are two components to
our provision expense. Our actual write-off performance in the quarter, which as we just discussed remains strong
and second, changes in our credit reserves where there are a few key drivers. Our loan balances, especially our
revolving loan balances, grew strongly quarter-over-quarter, and the macroeconomic outlook that we flowed
through our models which was informed by third-party macroeconomic forecasts as well as the latest Fed outlook
was slightly worse this quarter, relative to last quarter. The combination of our strong loan growth and the updated
macroeconomic assumptions resulted in a $387 million reserve build.
This reserve build combined with low net write-offs drove $778 million of provision expense for the third quarter.
As you see on slide 12, we ended the third quarter with $3.5 billion of reserves. With reserves for loans
representing 3.2% of our balances. I would point out, even with this quarter's reserve build this remains well below
the reserve levels we had pre-pandemic driven by our improved portfolio quality today compared to that prior time
period. Going forward, we continue to expect delinquency and loss rates to move up slowly over time but to
remain below pre-pandemic levels this year. I do expect to end the year with a higher-level of reserves on our
6

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
balance sheet than where we ended this quarter given our expected loan growth, the overall level of reserve
adjustments will again be influenced by how the macroeconomic outlook evolves in the fourth quarter.
Moving next to revenue on slide 13. Total revenues were up 24% year-over-year in the third quarter or 27% on
our FX adjusted basis. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I
would note that service fees and other revenue was up 39% year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, the strong
growth was largely driven by our recovery in travel-related revenues.
Our largest revenue line, discount revenue, grew 26% year-over-year in Q3 on an FX adjusted basis. As you can
see on slide 14, driven by both our sustained growth in Goods & Services spending and the continued momentum
in T&E spending that you saw in our spending trends. Net card fee revenues were up 23% year-over-year in the
third quarter on an FX adjusted basis with growth continuing to accelerate as you can see on slide 15, largely
driven by the continued attractiveness of both prospects and existing customers of our fee-paying products due to
the investments we've made in our premium value propositions.
This quarter, we acquired 3.3 million new cards, with acquisitions of US Consumer Platinum and Gold Card
Members and US Business Platinum Card Members all reaching record highs in the quarter and now each more
than two times higher than pre-pandemic levels, demonstrating the great demand we're seeing, especially for our
premium fee-based products.
Moving on to slide 16, you can see that net interest income was up 30% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis
due to the recovery of our revolving loan balances. While generally speaking, a rising rate environment would be
a modest headwind for us, due to our sizable non-interest-bearing charge balances, and actual fact it has been
fairly neutral in terms of impact for us year-to-date. over time though I would expect rising rates to represent a
modest headwind.
To sum up on revenues we're seeing strong results across-the-board and really good momentum. When looking
at slide 17, I would point out that we have now seen six consecutive quarters of revenue growth above 24% on an
FX adjusted basis, as we are now showing strong growth even on top of the strong recovery of that growth in the
prior-year quarter. I would also point out that we have a couple hundred basis points of difference when looking at
revenue growth on an FX adjusted basis, versus our reported results. So while we are leaving our full year
reported revenue guidance at 23% to 25% for 2022, I would expect to be above that growth rate range on an FX
adjusted basis.
Now, all this revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we've made in our brand,
value propositions, customers, colleagues, technology and coverage, and those investments show up across the
expense lines you see on slide 18. Starting with variable customer engagement costs, these costs, as you see on
slide 18, came in at 41% total revenues for the third quarter roughly in-line with what I still expect variable
customer engagement costs to run for the full-year at around 42% total revenues.
On the marketing line, we invested $1.5 billion in the third quarter, on track with our expectation to spend over $5
billion in 2022. We feel really good about the strong demand [ph] in (00:19:46) card acquisitions especially
premium card acquisitions as we showed on slide 15, and more importantly, we feel good about the spend, credit
and revenue profiles of the customers we are bringing into American Express membership, which continued to
look strong relative to what we saw pre-pandemic.
Moving to the bottom of slide 18, brings us to operating expenses, which were $3.3 billion in the third quarter,
essentially flat to last quarter. As Steve and I have both discussed all year, these results reflect the impact
7


American Express Co.
(AXP) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
inflation has had on our operating expenses, in addition to our investments in other key growth underpinnings to
support our tremendous revenue growth.
You can see, based off our third quarter results, that we are tracking with our expectation for operating expenses
to be around $13 billion for the full year. In looking at the year-over-year OpEx growth of 22% this quarter, it is
also important to note that we see an impact from the prior-year including a sizable benefit from net mark-to-
market gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio, while this year we saw a modest impairment
charge. More generally, we continue to see operating expenses as a key source of leverage moving forward, and
we'd expect to have far less growth in OpEx than revenues in our ambitious growth plan.
Turning next to capital on slide 19. We returned $1 billion of capital to our shareholders in the third quarter
including common stock repurchases of $600 million and $391 million in common stock dividends on the back of
strong earnings generation. Our CET1 ratio was 10.6% at the end of the third quarter within our target range of
10% to 11%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our
balance sheet growth.
That then brings me to our growth plan and 2022 guidance on slide 20. With each quarter of this year, we have
demonstrated consistent progress against our 2022 guidance and our long-term growth aspirations of delivering
sustainable high levels of revenue and EPS growth. For the full-year 2022, we are reaffirming our reported
revenue growth guidance of 23% to 25%, although I would point out as I said earlier that I would expect our FX
adjusted revenue growth to be above that range, and we now expect to be above our original EPS guidance
range of $9.25 to $9.65, an uncertainty in the level of our final EPS for the year remains a poll impact on credit
reserves of how the macroeconomic outlook evolves in the fourth quarter, while I expect our actual credit
performance and metrics to remain healthy, it's harder to predict exactly how the macroeconomic outlook might
evolve.
In addition, we are working towards our 2023 plan and expect revenue growth to remain above our long-term
aspirational targets, which should create a platform for producing strong EPS growth. Of course, we'll have to see
how the economic environment evolves versus where we are today. In any environment though, we remain
committed to executing against our growth plan and running the company with a focus on achieving our aspiration
of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth on a sustainable basis in 2024 and
beyond.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So maybe just to start on the top-line, Steve. Solid results once again although clearly as you and Jeff articulated
FX was a headwind in-quarter and I know you mentioned you aren't seeing changes. Jeff mentioned the strength
over the quarter. Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing from a spend perspective maybe relative to
what you saw 90-days ago? Any changes under the surface? And then maybe just flush out a little bit further your
confidence in the ability to generate mid-teens top and bottom line growth into 2023. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
We're confident. Look, the spending speaks for itself, I mean, just look at some of these numbers. You've got
Goods & Services up 16%, our US Consumer's up 22%, Millennial spending is up 39%. Our T&E spending is up
57%. International spending is 37%. We haven't seen any change and you could look at this quarter-over-quarter,
and the reality is that last quarter was a record level quarter in terms of spending and this was like, I don't know,
$1 billion behind or something like that, but if you look at year-over-year growth, we're not seeing any changes in
consumer spending behavior at all.
And look, that's not to say that things may not change, but I can only look at what I'm seeing right now and if I look
from a forward perspective, the question that we get is what about T&E? Can T&E spending [ph] hold (00:26:04)
so forth and so on and look, I think you heard Ed Bastian last week and he talked about not only what's been
going on at Delta but what they see going on through the holiday season. I think you heard Chris Nassetta as well
say the same kinds of things and what's happening with Hilton, two of our biggest partners. And so when we look
at our consumer travel booking, we see higher bookings than we've seen in a long, long time. I mean, that goes
pre-pandemic.
So if I look three out because the next question that people ask is what does the holiday season look like? Well
the holiday season from a travel perspective looks really, really strong because people are booking three months
out and if you're going to be traveling, you're probably going to be going to restaurants and if you're traveling
9

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
some place, you're probably bringing presents with you as well. So, we don't see anything really changing over
the next three months, and as we go into next year, we still feel really good about what our growth plan is, and the
only thing I would say is because I think I need to say this, is that if things change, we will be prepared to pivot,
and I think people saw that during the pandemic.
We've got our recession playbook. You have a credit cycle playbook, and we'll pull that playbook lever if we need
to pull it, but to pull it at this particular point in time doesn't make any sense. We're seeing strong growth, and
we're seeing strong credit results overall, so right now, nothing new. And the way I would headline this is that this
quarter looks like the first quarter, which looked like the second quarter and it's the third quarter. It's another
strong quarter for us and the only thing that I would say is, I mean, when you look at our model, I think not only
this quarter but this year, it really shows the strength of our differentiated business model. We have a different
model than other people out there in the marketplace and I think that's coming through on our statistics.
Year-over-year earnings growth and the top-line revenue growth is not something you're used to seeing from us,
unless you've been looking at the last six quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Ryan, let me just add maybe a few other comments to try to mention when Steve and I use a term like well we
know how to pivot if we need to. I would remind everyone that GDP in the US shrank in the first two quarters of
this year, and we've been putting up revenue growth in the 24% to 30% range steadily right through that. I'd
remind you that I talked about our credit reserve is influenced by a macroeconomic forecast and so you can go
look at what the Fed said in September. You can go look at what Moody's is saying, and they are predicting
modest upticks in unemployment and that's contemplated in everything Steve and I have said and in the guidance
that we've provided.
If you look at October, October is just a continuation of all that Steve just talked about thus far, so we feel good
about the guidance we've given. We are acknowledging the environment we're in, but I don't want people to
overplay our reaction to the fact that growth has been pretty slow in the US, because with our differentiated
business model as Steve just pointed out, performing very strongly in this environment.

Steve, you talked about the recession playbook. Maybe we could just talk about your comments about operating
the business for the long term and if we were to see a slowdown, how we should think about managing the
expenses, marketing has been boosted quite a bit. You wouldn't want to grow as fast as you are right now in a

backdrop so maybe just talk about the flex there, how we should think about the aspirational targets in the
backdrop of a recession or a mild one even? And then, Jeff, could you just hit the reserve rate? I know people
tend to think about that reserve rate as a result – as it relates to CECL day one. Do you see yourself getting back
to that level given how low losses are right now? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So if you think about operating sort of in a recession, operating the playbook, I think the first thing you have to
realize is that when you look at sort of credit and you look at how you acquire customers and how you underwrite
customers, those are things that we do on an ongoing basis, right? And so we make adjustments daily, weekly, I
mean, the models are constantly being updated and changing and our return thresholds are changing, and so as
we say we manage through-the-cycle.
When we look at [indiscernible] (00:31:19) Card Members, we manage that so that coming through that, there's
profitability, okay, and so we will continue to do that and I'll point you back to the pandemic and what we did
during the pandemic because I think that's a really good – it's a really good model for us.
So what did we do? Well, you pulled back on your Card Member acquisition because number one, we didn't have
enough transparency at that particular point in time, and number two, maybe we weren't feeling good about sort of
the Card Members that we could acquire at that point, but we never shut it down. We still acquired Card Members
so you would see that.
The only thing I would point out is we've been trending from a marketing perspective to spend well in excess of $5
billion, if you go back pre-pandemic that number was between $3.5 billion and $3.9 billion and so it gives us a lot
of flexibility in terms of delevering our marketing expenditure.
The other thing you have to realize is that a lot of our cost to Card Member services are variable in terms of
spending, and rewards as well go up and they go down as spending increases, and so I have a lot of confidence
in our ability to flex our marketing numbers down. I have tremendous confidence in our ability to flex our operating
expenses because operating expenses in a lot of ways go along with a lot of our volumes, so, and we've proven
we can do that, and I think our underwriting you would continue to tighten that up, but that's something that we
look at on an ongoing basis. That's not something that you sort of just sort of clean-up when you get into it. You're
tightening that up as you go along and as you see any signals.
And then the last thing I would say is you get into credit and collections and your ability to help out Card Members
in a thoughtful way, and your ability to collect money, and I think that a lot of the programs that we introduced
during the pandemic were programs that we would be taking off the playbook. And the last point I would say is our
card base is not representative of the US economy. When you look at the share of cards that we have in this
marketplace and a number of Card Members, it's obviously well-below double-digits and they aren't necessarily
representative of what's going on in the broader economy and the last point that I would make is a lot of people try
and equate what's going on with the stock market and going on in spending, there is no correlation in our history
of that.
The thing that you do worry about is unemployment and in particular, white collar unemployment, and so as we
think about professionals that could potentially be laid off, that's something that you look at but again, our models
take all that into account and you know, we've been through that kind of stuff before, and I think we're very well
prepared for it.

Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
So, before I get to credit reserves, Sanjay, I can't resist just adding though, you said well what would you do in a
mild recession? I don't want to get into the full debate here about semantics, but some could argue that from a
growth perspective we're in a mild recession and we just grew revenues 27% and to turn it to our credit reserves,
our credit reserve adjustments do include the latest economic forecast, which has unemployment ticking up a little
bit next year and that's included in all of our forward-looking comments.
As you point out and maybe to help everyone, Sanjay, I think it's on slide 12 in our deck today. Our day one credit
reserve percentages of total loans were 4.6%. This quarter they were all the way down at 3.2%. I will point out
that if you look across the industry, that is by far the lowest percentage. It's also the lowest percentage relative to
day one. There's differential timing that all the different financial institutions have had over the last couple of
years, just due to the vagaries, the way the accounting works here today but as you sit here today, our reserve
balance both on an absolute basis and relative to that day one basis is below the industry and that makes sense,
Sanjay, because we have by far the most premium book in the industry. We have by far the strongest credit
metrics, and relative to pre-pandemic and that day one number, our credit profile is stronger today.
All the talk you hear from Steve and I and Doug and others about our record success bringing more premium
consumers into the franchise over the last couple-years has an impact on credit profile as well, so all else being
equal, you would not expect our reserve percentage of loans to get back to where it was day one CECL because
the average credit profile is stronger than it was day one CECL.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please proceed
with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah, thanks. Could you discuss what's driving the accelerating new account growth off of already higher
numbers and how sustainable you view account growth anywhere near these levels to be? Any color you can
provide on kind of the ramp in spend you would normally observe from new accounts as they age and then finally,
did you see a surge in new account applications from Gen Z around your Jack Harlow concert?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
I can't comment on the Jack Harlow concert, not that I can't comment on it. I'm not aware of the surge in account
acquisition. I'm sure it didn't hurt us. Look, I think that what you've seen here is we're not going out and just trying
to grab the lots and lots of cards. We're out there, we're adding high-value cards, and the value proposition is
really strong, and the value propositions are really playing well with Millennial and Gen Z at 60% of our card
acquisition, and while I don't have the numbers handy with me in terms of how the ramping goes in sort of, in year
one spending here. What I would point out is we're acquiring 60% of the cards that we're acquiring are Millennial
and Gen Z and that cohort was up 39% this quarter, so I think this whole concept of generational relevance and
bringing people into the franchise early and bringing them in on a premium product that they can really embed
their lives into has really helped us out tremendously, as opposed to bringing them in on a free-fee product and
trying to upgrade them along.
I think a plot of Millennials and Gen Zs are using this product and again as we've always said it's just a payment
product. We view ourselves as a lifestyle brand and as a lifestyle product and the Jack Harlow concert is a good
12

example of kind of the things that we do to embed ourselves in people's lives, and we talked about Resy, and we
talked about travel, and those services and those bookings are going up, and people are using that, and so it's
just more than just a payment product.
Again, Mark, I don't have the sort of first year ramp-up spending, but 39% is a pretty good indication. As far as are
we going to acquire 3.3 million cards next quarter? I don't really have any idea. We'll acquire those cards that as
we underwrite them, they make sense for us to go, they will be profitable through-the-cycle. Could that be 3.3?
Yeah, it could be 3.3, it could be 2.9, it could be 3.5, we aren't having card acquisition targets. What we're looking
at is acquiring those Card Members that meet our criteria, and it just so happened that it was 3.3 this particular
quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
The only two comments I would add, Mark, are amongst the modest risk management adjustments we've made
across the course of this year is we have significantly actually raised our financial hurdles required for some of the
new Card Members that we're bringing in, and still just brought in a record level, which tells you something about
the level of demand that we see right now due to all of the traits that Steve just talked about.
I'd also point out as I said in my earlier remarks that that average customer, whose behaviors we track every
single month, is coming in with much higher spend patterns, much better average credit quality, and a much
greater average fee component than what we were seeing pre-pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So it's harder to qualify to get a card. We're getting more. I mean, just to cut to the chase.

Hi. I just wanted to understand a little bit about how you thought the FX impacted yourself in the quarter. I know
we can see a variety of ways that you present but just want to understand from your perspective what the impact
was on the revs and on the expense side in particular, the rewards side, and then give us a sense as to how you
think about the revenue guidance range, if it was FX adjusted for the year and for what you're expecting in the
fourth quarter. Thanks.

Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So thank you for the question, Betsy. I will say I think foreign-exchange movement is very dramatic right now and
more dramatic than they have been in many years. I think they are a little difficult to communicate and hard for a
lot of people to fully understand, so you've seen dramatic moves in many of the currencies that are most
important to us from the yen to the euro to the pound, and so when you look at our revenue growth this quarter,
that's why you saw a 300 basis points difference between the FX adjusted revenue growth and the reported
revenue growth of 24%.
Now, on the bottom line, it is a much more muted impact, Betsy, because of course we also have a very large
proportion of our colleagues outside the US to go with all that business that we do around the globe, the cost of
rewards in all those countries is in the local currencies, so the impact on our earnings per share is pretty di
minimis. I think we have a 10-K disclosure where we talk about over the course of a full-year movement maybe
costing you $0.10, a quarter so that's why I don't really call it out when you think about EPS.
When you convert all of that into our guidance it's why we're very comfortable saying we're going to be above our
EPS guidance range. We left our reported revenue growth number the same as it was previously. I would expect
to be a couple hundred basis points above that reported revenue guidance on an FX adjusted basis, so I'll
conclude by saying in some ways what we're saying is our revenue performance has exceeded our expectations
of 90-days ago. That has sort of offset the foreign-exchange headwinds which were a little bit greater on the
revenue side than what I would have expected 90-days ago but at the bottom-line you don't really need to factor it
in that much.

Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you, and good morning. Love to get a little update on SMB and online spending. The SMB obviously is a
critical business for you and just obviously growing strongly, but any color you can give on SMB any changes, and
then online spend has actually been pretty steady. A lot of, I guess, discussion around what is the right growth
rate for online spend versus offline over the long run I think is a little bit of a decel and maybe an offline but steady
in online so just any color on SMB and your thoughts on the long-term growth of online spending.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I mean, we'll talk about Goods & Services spending, which is really when you start to talk about online and
offline. Look, our Goods & Services spending is 16% and it's the growth rate is split pretty evenly. In fact, offline
maybe growing slightly more than online, but both in that 15% to 17% range, so and I think that's sustainable. I
think that obviously online spending popped up, but Offline spending is back above pre-pandemic levels, so we
feel really good about both.
I think consumers are, drive past the mall. Consumers are out there shopping and spending and they're also
ordering online so I think it's sort of a double hit for us in a very positive way, so we're very comfortable with the
16% Goods & Services spending and that's approximately 70% of all of our spending.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please proceed with
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Guys, thanks for taking my question. I want to revisit the topic we raised last quarter. Historically, your product
offerings basically caused a customer base that's positively selected for spend and pay and the product offering
essentially Habituated them to a pattern. Now, you're offering a product that offers revolve on day one and as you
move into a younger demographic, do you think over time despite the upward move in terms of the credit profile,
that that will change credit performance that you will actually increase your beta to the credit cycle because you've
changed the way you habituated your customer and how you've selected them?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, so I think, Rick, it's a good question because you are good to point out that there's been a significant
change as we have, from our perspective, added more functionality for all of our customers on what our traditional
charge products and many to most of those customers still use them as traditional charge products and leave it
paying off every 30 days and some occasionally take advantage of their new functionality and being able to carry
a balance if they want for a little bit, but when you think about the impact on the company, Steve used the term a
couple times today, our differentiated business model.
If you look over time, our net interest income is about 19% to 20% of our overall revenues, and that's where it was
many years ago and frankly, that's where we'd expect it to be many years from now, because as much as we see
an opportunity to get a little bigger share of our full consumer and small business customers lending wallet, we
grew fees 23% this quarter and we are seeing tremendous growth in discount revenue, so we do get great growth
and expect to continue to get great growth on the lending side, but I don't actually expect it to make a big
difference in the overall mix of revenues that we have as a company or in the business model we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
No, I don't think it's going to make a difference in the mix of, as Jeff said, in the mix of our overall breakup of
revenue and – breakup of revenue, but I think what it also gives us an opportunity is to actually acquire more
spending, and when we did not have that feature, that group may have started off with a competitive lending card,
or we may have put them on a blue cash [indiscernible] (00:49:23) card and so what's happening is, and I think
this bears out in the spending numbers of 39% growth, that cohort is consolidating their spending and they're
consolidating their spending with our product and it's giving them an opportunity to earn more rewards. And so I
don't really think it changes the credit profile.
I think it gives us an opportunity to actually capture more spend and to ultimately capture more revenue and a
more important part is I think the lifetime value of these customers is going to be a lot more than the lifetime value
of where we acquired previously, because we're going to run these people right through – we're going to run
these consumers right through-the-cycle and they're going to be with us from day one and I think that's really
15

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
important, so I don't think it changes the profile of our revenue. I don't think it changes the profile of sort of the
riskiness of our company, but I do think it gives us an opportunity to grow more spending and, obviously, to
capture more revenue from this segment.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Please
proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. The loan growth was up as you just mentioned
about 31%. That's really industry-leading levels of loan growth, and I know you've talked about in the past that
you're trying to penetrate your existing customer base. And so you've effectively underwritten these people
through their spending habits over time, but you – and you – and a while ago, I think, you provided how much of
the loan growth was coming from an existing customer base spending cohort, and not. Could you just provide
some of the breakdowns that are giving you this supercharged loan growth versus the industry again? Thanks so
much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Let me just start, Dominick, with a few stats that I think are important and then Steve may want to add. I mean,
the biggest thing driving of course the 31% growth in loans tremendous growth in spending, right, so we are in a
recovery mode of spending and seeing tremendous progress there, and customers are also beginning to rebuild
balances a little bit, so I think it's very natural. So, yes, I think when you look at those who have reported thus far
you're seeing industry-leading growth in loans, but you're also seeing industry-leading growth in spending, I think
that's very, very important to put those two together. So I think we feel good about the trends and expect them to
continue, and I would expect long term, just as we were before the pandemic, to grow a little faster than the
industry on lending and to do it while still maintaining best-in-class credit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. And then I think what's also important to realize is that this loan growth is not all revolving balances here,
right, I mean, so that's an important point, but spending growth like we've had will drive overall loan growth and
yes, it's a – we've had a large year-to-date sort of spend, spending and growth, but if you just look at it sort of
sequentially quarter-to-quarter, because we had pretty much the same card growth, you only have about $4 billion
in overall loan growth on a sequential basis but you do have quite a bit year-over-year, so it's not like all of a
sudden this thing just jumped up. Spending continues, spending has continued on a quarter-to-quarter basis and
that drives up lending. Loan growth, excuse me.

Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Maybe as a follow-up, I think, Jeff, you'd mentioned that the interest-bearing portion had continued
to grow faster, kind of helping net interest income. Could you just talk about when that levels off? How does that –
and I guess, Steve had sort of mentioned just in the answer to the last question a little bit about kind of a fair
16

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
amount of that growth in lending not being kind of interest-bearing balance, so as you look at that going forward,
how do you think that develops?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So I would expect, Moshe, for the next couple of quarters to see the revolving or interest-bearing portion of those
balances grow a little bit faster than the overall loan growth because we're not quite back to pre-pandemic levels
of behavior. I think our expectation is over time and I think it may take a while still, you will eventually get back to
pre-pandemic types of behavior. The other factor I would point to goes a little bit to Rick Shane's earlier question,
which is you do have this evolution going on as we've added a little bit more functionality to some of our charge
products, so those customers who have the traditional charge products but have that pay overtime feature and to
use it less than your traditional credit card or revolving customer.
So that's putting a little bit of complexity in tracking our numbers here, but I think in terms of watching the macro
trend, I would expect loan balances to grow a little bit faster than the industry. I would expect for the next couple
of quarters the revolving portion to grow a little bit faster than the loan growth, and I would expect all of those
things to really set down into steady-state levels about where they were pre-pandemic.

Yes. On the international org change, does that signal maybe a faster pace of investment? I know it's always
been kind of a balancing act in international markets. And then also is there anything new on the tech investment
strategy? I saw you were sort of ramping up hiring, seems a little late in the game for that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
No, I think the tech investment strategy remains the same and I mean, there was an article on us ramping up
hiring and that's – there's a lot of contract-to-conversion that we're doing. I mean, anybody that's in financial
services has their own employee base and has a large contractor base, and so it's not necessarily an indication of
increased head count in technology, nor is it an indication of being late in the game.
What it is an indication of is a balancing act between our contract-to-population and our overall colleague
population, so we've been pretty steady with our tech investment over the last couple of years, and we'll continue
that tech, that same level of tech investment this year, and what was your first question, Don?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
problems and issues that you have, and when you think about acquiring Card Members, engaging Card
Members, and retaining Card Members, having a sort of a dual or a tri-market structure, sometimes can slow
down your speed and your agility versus having a single market leader looking at making what are the right
investment decisions for that market.
And so how many small business cards we could acquire? How many consumer cards we acquire. How do you
adjudicate what customers should get a small business or a consumer card? I think this will allow us not only to
get products to market faster, but to also make sure that we're putting the right investment in the right channels as
we move across.
As far as extra money being invested in international, we have an enterprise investment strategy and we will put
the money where the best returns are, so if we can get more returns out of investing in market A or market B
versus the US or vice versa, we will do that and the other thing that I would say look I've been around for a long,
long time and organizational constructs change for the times that you're in, and for the technology that's available,
for the value propositions that are available, I mean this is in some ways, a little bit back to the future.
We did globalize all these things but now we feel it's better to take these global capabilities that we have and
deploy them on a much more local level with more local decision-making and more adjudication between sort of
the various business units so we just think that will be a more effective and faster way. And coming out of the
pandemic, I think speed of decision-making and agility will be really important.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi, your [ph] PPNRB (00:59:19) and the strength of the underlying trends certainly highlight the earnings power in
the model, but I was hoping that you could address investor concerns that thinking back to the 2007 timeframe
your models back then were saying that customers with multiple mortgages were good credits, and you guys
essentially grew into that recession and while today's environment is very different, some investors are looking
somewhat by analogy to that timeframe, and have expressed concern that you may once again be growing into
the next recession, and the strong spending trends that you're seeing are a reflection of the inflation problem that
the Fed is trying to fight. Would love to hear your thoughts around that dynamic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
I'll give you my thoughts and Jeff can kind of jump in. We've learned a lot since 2007, and we've changed quite a
bit, and to think that 2007 is indicative of how we handle 2022 I think would be foolish for 2023 and again I'll just
point you to the pandemic where I think one of the things that went unnoticed during this pandemic was how we
18


American Express Co.
(AXP) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
handled people in distress, and I think we handled them very well from both a short-term perspective and a long-
term perspective and if you remember when Jeff used to present these slides during the pandemic, we talked
about AR in distress at times and we manage that quite carefully.
I can also say that our ability to collect is completely different than it was back then. Our models are different back
then, but I think people can think what they want, but would be foolish to think that we haven't changed or learned
a lot.
In terms of growing into the recession, what I would say is this. 80% of our growth is driven by transactions right
now, so if you look at that spending number, this is not inflation. This is transactions. This is higher levels of
engagement, and so the notion of us, we're growing because we have some tailwind of inflation is also a silly
notion, because we're engaging our Card Members more. We have more transactions. We have more Card
Members, and the last point just going back to your first question, so is our card base is so much different than it
was in 2007 from an economic perspective. It's a much more robust, resilient card base than it was back in 2007,
and also, the way we grew our balance was not necessarily just through spending back then. It was a lot of
balance transfer activity and so I think this company is a very different company than it was in 2007, going into the
recession.
The card base is different. The way we were growing is different. We've really become much more of a spend
growth company. We have a lot more premium cardholders. We have a lot more fee-paying cardholders than we
did. Our growth is coming from very different sources, so at the end of the day, when and if you have a big
downturn, we'll see what happens, but we feel pretty good about the abilities and we feel pretty good about our
models and we feel really good about how our spending is being acquired right now, so we're not just riding a
tailwind here. We are riding real growth through customer acquisition and increased spending from existing
customers because the value propositions are driving that growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
And the only thing I would add is that just like that spend is coming from existing customers, the loan growth is
predominantly coming from existing customers that we know well, who have a better average credit profile and we
feel good about our winning through-the-cycle models that tell us these are customers who we should have in any
environment and I think I'll come back to my earlier comments about our credit reserve levels are still below
everyone else in the industry. They're below relative to day one CECL where others are, and that's appropriate
given our strong credit profile, so we feel good about where we are.

Just a follow-up on – hi, on that point, given the continued strength in your business and the fact that you're still
benefiting from a lot of these sort of lagging recovery tailwinds from the pandemic, can you just update us on your
thoughts on taking advantage of the current valuation environment pursuit some tuck-in M&A and other more like
chunkier organic investments for example, things that you're perhaps looking at or leaning in on in terms of
accelerating areas of your business? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
I mean, chunky organic investments, you've seen how we've driven our marketing spending, and to acquire Card
Members while as Jeff said making it harder to get a card, so I think that we've leaned-in on our marketing
investments. We feel really good about our technology investments, and look, we're always looking at
opportunities to tuck things in that make sense for us. I mean, whether it was Kabbage or Resy or LoungeBuddy
or acompay and so forth, we're always looking at those things that will be add – will be adjacent and add to our
organic core. We're not looking for are things that are sort of outside of our universe.
I think we've proven that we can expand with our customer base, we can expand the services that we're offering,
and looking at additional services that lead them to more spending, or lead to more acquisition opportunities,
which when you look at Resy, people look at Resy as a restaurant reservation system. We look at that as a way
to engage our Card Members, as a way to engage with our restaurants, and we look at it as a way to acquire new
Card Members, and so acompay is another one where it's an ability to pick up more B2B spending, so we're
always on the lookout for capabilities and if the right valuation comes along, with the right set of capabilities, yeah,
we'll take advantage of it. But as far as leaning in sort of on organic investments, I think we've leaned-in, I think
we've invested in marketing. We've invested in Card Member services. We've invested in our value proposition,

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for squeezing me in here. I just wanted to really quickly, touch on the regulatory
backdrop. See if there is anything worth highlighting from your perspective, specifically I'm thinking of the Durbin
proposal, and if that's interesting to you there, but is there anything else also on regulatory that we should think
about? Thank you.

I'm sorry, Mihir, it was really hard – I don't know if you're on a speaker phone or – it was really hard to hear you.
Durbin, is that the question.

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Sorry, yeah, I was just asking about the Durbin proposal and the regulatory backdrop.

(AXP) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Okay. That's very clear now. So look, in terms of the Durbin proposal, it's a proposal. I can't speculate how this is
going to come out and it obviously is not going to impact us, because we're a three-party system, so we don't
really see that impacting us negatively. Will it impact us positively or will it actually happen? We continue to look
at it and we'll see what happens there.
As far as the regulatory environment, it's a tough regulatory environment and I think in a lot of ways, we know the
objective is to [indiscernible] (01:08:27) consumers and to be transparent with consumers and we applaud all of
that, so I think the CFPB is talking about late fees and things like that, and these are not material parts of our
revenue streams, but I think transparency with consumers is really, really important, and we obviously want to do
all of that, but I don't think the regulatory environment is any tougher than it's been over the last few years, and
we'll continue to operate in that environment and obviously, it adds – sometimes it adds a little bit of cost to
comply with certain things, whether that means technological changes or what have you, but it's just like
competition.
It really, it's always there and you have to make sure that you're investing to meet the regulatory guidelines and
we'll continue to do that, but I don't see it as a big headwind for us or a headwind at all for us as we move forward.
