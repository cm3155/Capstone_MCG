Q4 2021 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2022
Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kay, and thanks everyone for joining us today. In 2021, we delivered solid operating and financial
results with strong growth on both sides of the balance sheet, steady asset quality metrics, and continued
momentum in our fee businesses. When many others in our industry struggled to generate meaningful loan
growth, we delivered 12.3% increase in average loans in 2021, excluding PPP, largely through market share
gains. We're positioned to benefit from the anticipated economic expansion, higher interest rates, and continued
investments we're making.
In 2022, while others are predicting growth based on a better economic environment, we are confident that we'll
continue to garner more than our fair share of that growth. There were a few factors that had outsized impacts on
our results in the fourth quarter and the full year. We had higher than typical operating expenses, largely driven by
higher incentive compensation for the strong business performance we experienced, along with additional
charitable contributions in the quarter.
Additionally, we saw some variances in software costs and legal and consulting expenses related to timing of our
business investments. We estimate that approximately $10 million of the linked-quarter increase in expenses was
variable in nature and attributed to timing of spend. Many of these incremental expenses should reset lower in the
first quarter. As we've discussed before, we remain focused on delivering positive operating leverage across all
environments while we continue to invest prudently in our people and platforms.
On the revenue side, in 2020, the gain on our investment in Tattooed Chef and ongoing market related
adjustments impacted year-over-year comparisons. Ram will share more detail on the various drivers shortly, but
we expect to generate positive operating leverage in 2022, excluding the impact of PPP with or without the benefit
of higher interest rates.
Turning to our fourth quarter results. Net income for the quarter was $78.5 million or $1.61 per share. Pre-tax,
pre-provision income on an FTE basis was $113.4 million or $2.32 per share. Fourth quarter net interest income
was $210.6 million and was relatively flat compared to the third quarter. And we saw positive contributions on the
fee income side.
On services, total assets under administration have grown nearly 25% from year-end 2020 to stand at an
impressive $419 billion. Custody assets crossed the $150-billion threshold, driven by organic growth. In specialty
trust and agency solutions, we saw 149% increase in new business in 2021. And our teams continue to garner
industry recognition for service and innovative products. In private wealth, new asset sales for 2021 increased
17% over the prior year, and we continue to build out and strengthen our family office offering. I'm looking forward
to further momentum as we continue to invest in this business. You'll see more detail in the line of business
updates in the presentation.
Moving to the balance sheet, slide 24 is a snapshot of our loan portfolio, showing the drivers behind the loan
growth I mentioned. Average loans for the fourth quarter, excluding PPP balances, increased nearly 13% year-
over-year and nearly 6% on a linked quarter annualized basis. Asset quality remained strong, with net charge-offs
of 19 basis points for the quarter and 27 basis points for the full year, consistent with our outlook and our historical
averages.
Average C&I loans increased 12% on a linked quarter annualized basis as we continue to deepen penetration in
our markets. Most of our commercial clients are reporting strong pipelines and backlogs across most industries. In
general, these are more positive feelings about the direction of 2022, while customers are keeping an eye on

supply chain and labor issues impacting so many businesses. And clients have expressed more interest lately in
expansion, both organic and through acquisition.
In our commercial real estate and construction portfolios, average balances were impacted by payoffs and by
typical cycles as completed projects are converted to term loans sold or refinanced in the secondary market.
Average residential mortgage balances grew 6.5% from the third quarter, an annualized increase of nearly 26%.
Funded mortgage loans for the quarter were $200 million, including $55 million in the secondary market. In 2021,
we saw a 70% increase in secondary market mortgages compared to 2020.
Total top line loan production, as shown on slide 25, was very strong, coming in at $1.4 billion for the quarter, a
record level for us. Payoffs and paydowns were 5.6% of loans, in line with prior quarter. Many of our recent
payoffs have been tied to merger and acquisition activity. More clients have been taking advantage of attractive
multiples, often partnering with private equity firms and family offices. At the same time, we continue to see
financing opportunities coming from some of these same PE firms and family offices.
While estimating payoffs can be unpredictable, we continue to see a robust pipeline with opportunities across all
verticals in the first quarter. Finally, earlier in January, we pursued and executed the sale of our small acquired
factoring portfolio to an alternative financing company. Ram will discuss the financial impact of the sale of our
factoring portfolio in his prepared remarks.
Overall, 2021 was a solid year. Like all of us, I'm hopeful we're nearing the final phase of this pandemic. But no
matter what issues we may navigate, I'm proud of our team and the resilience they've shown in serving our
customers and keeping UMB moving forward. We're excited for the opportunities we see ahead of us in 2022.
Now, I'll turn it over to Ram for some additional comments. Ram?

Ram Shankar
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Mariner. Net interest income was relatively flat compared to the third quarter at $210.6 million as the
benefit from solid balance sheet growth was partially offset by changes in asset mix, lower earning asset yields
and reduction in PPP income. We amortized $5.4 million of PPP origination fees into income, and the overall PPP
contribution to the fourth quarter net interest income was $6 million compared to $10.1 million last quarter.
At quarter-end, our PPP balances stood at $136 million, down from $318 million at September 30. Approximately
$3.8 million in unamortized fees remained at the end of the year. Average earning asset yields decreased 16
basis points to 2.49% due to asset mix changes, including increased liquidity and a $297-million decline in
average PPP balances.
For the full-year 2021, our factoring portfolio provided approximately $14 million in revenue and had about $10
million in associated costs. So, the pre-tax, pre-provision income impact was approximately $4 million. Fourth
quarter reported net interest margin fell 15 basis points from the third quarter to 2.37%, driven by additional
buildup in liquidity levels, lower reinvestment rates and core loan mix and repricing. The buildup of excess liquidity
accounted for approximately 10 basis points of the linked quarter contraction. For full year 2021, NIM was 2.50%.
As shown on slide 21, our Fed account, reverse repo and cash balances now comprise 19% of average earning
assets compared to 16% last quarter and just 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020 with a blended yield of 26 basis
points. Based on our current expectations for two to three rate hikes in 2022, deposit beta is consistent with our
experience during the last rate cycle and improved reinvestment rates on our cash flows, we expect that our

reported net interest margin has bottomed out and will likely improve from fourth quarter levels, generally in line
with the current consensus estimate of 2.4%.
While the volatility from PPP loans has subsided, our net interest margin and net interest income will continue to
be impacted by excess liquidity levels. Our provision for credit losses for the quarter was $8.5 million, driven
almost entirely by our strong loan growth. Excluding PPP loans, our end of period loans increased approximately
$900 million from September 30. Our allowance to loans, excluding PPP balances, is 1.14% compared to 1.20%
at September 30. Noninterest income for the fourth quarter was $118.8 million, an increase of $10.9 million from
the third quarter. Market fluctuations drove a $3.3-million positive variance in the value of our equity investments.
We currently have approximately 760,000 shares remaining in our Tatooed Chef position. Derivative income
increased $3.2 million from the prior quarter and deposit service charges increased $1.7 million on a linked-
quarter basis, largely related to client conversion fees in our healthcare business and corporate service charges. I
will note that just about 10% of our deposit service charge line item is related to retail activity.
Other drivers to fee income, including growth and both trust and securities processing and bond trading income
are shown on slide 22. Noninterest expense trends are shown on slide 23. Expense levels for the fourth quarter
were above our typical run rate and included a linked quarter increase of $7.3 million in salaries and bonus
expense driven by higher expenses related to business growth and positive business performance.
Legal and consulting, as well as marketing spend was higher in the fourth quarter and pertained to the timing of
such spend. Software and processing costs increased over the prior quarter and were driven by the
implementation of our new and improved private wealth management platform.
And as Mariner mentioned, we increased our charitable giving in 2021; and in the fourth quarter, the other
expense line included a $2.1-million linked quarter increase in contributions. These year-end gifts to organizations
in our markets that support housing needs, small business efforts and education pushed our giving above the $6-
million mark for the full year 2021.
Looking ahead, I'll reiterate that we expect to generate positive operating leverage in 2022 excluding the impact of
PPP with or without the benefit of higher interest rates. Our effective tax rate was 20.2% for the fourth quarter and
17.7% for the full year 2021. For the full year 2022, we anticipate an approximate 17% to 19%.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the
call.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will
come from Jared Shaw of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Good morning, Jared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
If we can start, Ram, you'd said on the margin, 2.4%, was that for full year 2022 or was that for first quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
That's the full year number. That's what [indiscernible] (00:14:23). So, when I gave guidance related – it was
relative to the consensus for 2022. Obviously, a lot of factors, Jared, will impact the outlook for margin. As I said,
as you see slide 21, you can see how that has grown just both in magnitude and as a proportion of our earning
assets, so a lot of factors will play in the margin. But at this point, based on our outlook for rates to 2.40-ish
sounds about right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. All right. And then it's great to see the loan growth this quarter. Can you give a little color on what you're
seeing with the C&I utilization rates? And then looking at going forward, as those begin to normalize, what type of
benefit could you get from just a more normal utilization rate? And then the impact – the expected impact of
paydowns over the next few quarters, do you think that that moderates?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Jared, it's Mariner. I would say that utilization rates, they bop around quite a bit within one or two
points, one way or the other, particularly during COVID. The period we're in is kind of hard to really tell where it
should be settling out from third quarter to fourth quarter in 2020. For example, it went the other way. And in this
quarter – these last two quarters, it went up slightly.

So, I think this pandemic period is kind of hard to just come up with an adjusted number, so it's been kind of
bopping around. So, I hesitate to give you what that normalized number should be right now. Pre-COVID, things
were bumping around 30%. Our utilization rate is really around 30%. So, you do with that what you will.
But on loan growth and payoffs and paydowns, we – as we have historically, we've given you a good look into the
next quarter. We try not to do too much guidance beyond the coming quarter. And as it relates to the pipeline for
the coming quarters, it looks strong as it has been looking. And I would say that fourth quarter 2021 was the best
gross production of quarter we've had at almost $1.4 billion in gross production. So, we're pretty pumped about
the trajectory and the successes we're having there.
As far as payoffs and paydowns go, I think we're running in the 5% range right now, high 5s in the fourth quarter. I
think as long as rates are low as they have been, that's going to push cap rates low, and the secondary market
opportunities will remain strong. Obviously, we're all projecting rates to come up. That should moderate – I think
that should moderate the payoffs and paydowns over the – over 2022 as rates come up. We'll have to see. Rates
coming up, they're still going to be at all-time lows. I think the market is going to still be very strong even with rates
coming up. But it should certainly moderate sales and paydowns.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then just maybe final one for me. When we look at the $10 million of expenses that you called
out here quarter-over-quarter, as we go into the first quarter, can you give us a little color on what could
potentially be staying around, what some of the puts and takes are? Or should we expect that – most of that $10
million is able to roll off?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, the way we are thinking about that $10 million is related – a good majority of that was related to production.
And so, if we continue to have very strong production, you'll see – you would theoretically see more bonus
commission compensation. Certainly, the charitable contributions were elevated based on our success last year.
So, I guess, again, if we were – towards the end of the year, if we're having great success, we would consider
giving back to our community at an elevated level like we did last year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I would add here on the loan growth front, I think really what happened in the fourth quarter story line was actually
a little muted because of the payoff activity at the end of the third quarter. So, I think our actual growth story in the
fourth quarter is better than it looks based on end of period loans versus of what the averages were because of
the starting point from the elevated payoff levels at the end of the third quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. Thanks.

Operator: The next question comes from Nathan Race of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yes. Hi, everyone. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
A question on deposits. Obviously, really significant end of period deposit growth. So just curious, do you expect
those deposits to largely remain on balance sheet as we start this year? And just any kind of updated thoughts on
just the stickiness of the massive deposit inflows that you guys have seen, which obviously can provide a
significant benefit as the Fed raises short-term rates with all the liquidity that you guys still have at the – have
today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Sure. I'd say it's a story of many points here, right? I mean, you've got what's happened over the pandemic and all
of the stimulus money that's come in. That's one. We're all – all of us as an industry and analyst community are
trying to figure out how long that sticks around. So, that's a part of it.
Then for us specifically in the fourth quarter on into the first quarter, as you're well aware, we build some public
fund dollars and some large institutional dollars, kind of year-end activity dollars, if you will, and that will bleed out
over the first quarter. We don't know exactly how far down that bleeds out. But if history is a good judge, it could
be $600 million or so over the first quarter on the public funds side that would roll back out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Nathan, this is Ram. I would say for us, like we've said in the past, right, I would not focus on end of period
balances both on the loan side and the deposit side, particularly on the deposit side. If you look at between
September 30 and December 31, our deposit balances end of period increased by $4.5 billion. A lot of it is
attributed to what Mariner said between public funds and some institutional. So, we have seen some receding of
those deposits. So, I would focus more on the average side just because, again, depending on which day the year
ends or the quarter ends, we should – we could see inflow of deposits.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2022
On the loan side, we did have some very strong generation activity in the fourth quarter. So that – as I said in my
previous comment, the average deal in that case is a little misleading to the upside positive for us, which is the
opposite of the story for the deposits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Understood. And within that context, just thinking about the likely upward increases in deposit cost as the Fed
raises short-term rates. Ram, can you just remind us in terms of where the index deposit balances stand on the
average balance basis in the fourth quarter and just general expectations for how your deposit betas are likely to
traject over the next several quarters relative to what we saw during the previous Fed tightening cycle between
2015 and 2018?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. In our interest rate analysis that you'll see in our 10-K, we assumed deposit betas that are consistent with
what happened last time. So I think, last time, we had a 225-basis point increase in short-term rates, and our
betas over that period came to about 45% or 48%. So, at least from that standpoint, we're assuming very similar
beta experience.
Obviously, with the excess liquidity in the system, there's an argument to be made that this time around we can
slow down those deposit cost increases, potentially depending on what the market does and competition does.
And then on your first question, about 35% of our funding is indexed to some short-term interest rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And that's a little higher than what we saw maybe three years or so ago. I think it was closer to 20%, 25%. Is that
correct, Ram?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
It's slightly higher than the last cycle when we left the last cycle. Correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then just maybe changing gears, one last one for me. Institutional Banking revenue segment,
particularly fund services posted really impressive revenue growth year-over-year. Fund services in particular
close to 30% year-over-year growth in 2021. I guess, is that growth rate sustainable into this year, and I guess
how you guys are kind of looking at the various dynamics within Institutional Banking as you guys kind of forecast
that revenue line for 2022?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'll take the beginning here and if Jim wants to add on, he can. The story is similar to what we've been
saying in the last handful of quarters, which is there's been a lot of disruption in the fund servicing market. A lot of
PE-driven acquisitions and mergers in that space, and that has put a lot of players on the sideline and caused a

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2022
lot of disruption in service. And as we have just benefited handsomely from that and that story just continues. And
I think that's really what I would say about that.
On top of just the market dynamics of private equity and alternatives, as an alternative to the public markets
continues to be just a very strong shift, I think, I'd call a permanent shift in kind of the market dynamics, which is
really where we play. And we're not really a big public equities [indiscernible] (00:25:04). We're doing more on the
private equity and the alternative side. And that really bodes well for us, I think, long term. That's what I'd say high
level.
Jim, you'd add anything more to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James D. Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, UMB Financial Corp.
No. I think you nailed it. We're continuing to differentiate ourselves on service, and the results are proof that our
model is working.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
That's great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And then on the rest of the businesses, it's kind of a similar story. The investments we've been making in people
and technology are really paying off, 17% growth in our wealth business. We haven't seen a year like that. And
sometimes the investments we've been making in people, we got a really great leader there. And having 17%
growth in new client assets is really tremendous for us. We're really excited about that development, and the
family office is a big part of that. The offering and the technology we've invested in there is really driving and
helping that whole business.
Corporate trust, man, that business is on fire. We went on the Nielsen lead tables. We went from number five to
number three in volume. We've been number three for some time now in a number of issues, but we went from
five to three in dollar volume. And so, we've really been gaining share there, which is great because to be growing
that business environment where the government isn't really spending the way they normally are, we're continuing
to take share. So, when that stimulus money does come and the government starts spending on a local basis and
redoing highways, roads, sewer systems, sidewalks, all those kinds of things, when that starts flowing again,
we're poised to really take our share there.
Additionally, as you look forward, as we've talked before, 12b-1 fees have been zeroed out for us looking
backward because of rate environment. It doesn't take much rate movement looking forward for us to pick up 12b-
1 fees. And, Jim, you might talk about [indiscernible] (00:27:13) look like.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James D. Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, UMB Financial Corp.
Well – so in 2019, our 12b-1 income and brokers and mutual fund income was approximately $31 million. In 2022,
after 150 basis points in rate cuts, we were sitting right at around $12 million. So, it usually takes two to three
months after we see an increase in rates for us to see any additional increases in those fees. But – so, we'll see a
benefit in 2022, but you should expect to see significant increases assuming we get the rate increases in 2023.

Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we're very excited. So, the profile for that business is very strong along with the newer business that we
have in the aviation trust business, which is really poised. Again, that's doing well in this environment. We'll do
even better when people are traveling and the world normalizes again. So, really, the profile across the board for
institutional and our fee business is very strong. Our card business led by our commercial card, we're very excited
and the prospects for that again for similar reasons as corporate spending picks up again. Looking forward, we sit
at $3.7 billion in spend at the end of the fourth quarter, again, in a muted environment. So that represents some
tailwind for us.
And then lastly, I know you didn't ask this but just thinking about the fee – overall fee picture for us, on a relative
basis, we're pretty excited about how we are positioned in a rising rate environment to not have to suffer the
changes that will come from the mortgage business reducing on our – within the business – within the industry.
We don't have a big mortgage business, so we don't stand to lose that. So, our profile going forward remains as
strong as it has been without having to deal with the downside pressures of a rate environment increasing.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. That's really great color. And just to clarify, Jim, on the 12b-1 fees, is it roughly like half of – is it roughly like
$500,000 in terms of the quarterly benefit you guys will see after each Fed rate hike?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
That's too – Nathan, this is Ram. This is kind of very specific. I mean, again as Jim said, the timing of it and we
have multiple funds as clients and not all of them have the same cycles to be able to sit here and say, what every
25 basis points might mean. It's tough to predict it for 2022.
On a full year run rate basis in 2023, as Jim said, that's where you'll see the biggest hockey stick. In 2022, you'll
certainly see [indiscernible] (00:30:04) based on when the rates go up, when the funds give those benefits back to
us. So, it's really hard sitting here just to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. The idea was just to give you a little color on what it looked like before $31 million. And by the way, that
$31 million was based on the amount of business we had in 2019 versus the amount of business we have and
clients we have going into 2022 and going into 2023. So, theoretically, we've got we've got more clients and more
customers, so that kind of would bode well for the overall volumes. So, it's hard to really tell what it will be, though
we can tell you what it was, right, two years ago, which was the idea.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. I really appreciate all the color, guys. I will step back. Thanks again.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Sure, Nathan.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2022
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Chris McGratty of KBW. Please go
ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Chris, you there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yes. Sorry about that. I was on mute. Hey, Ram, the question on the rate sensitivity, I think in your Q you show
modestly asset sensitive. But not – I think it understates it and I'm interested in the view on could you just remind
us what percent of loans were priced within a year, the floors, any estimate to what NII would benefit, like a
ballpark for each quarter hike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
So, I'll try that and come back at me if I don't answer the question. So, 55% of our total loans are variable in
nature. And then about 10% of our total loans have floors on them. But it really takes anywhere between 25-basis
point and 50-basis point rate moves for those to be truly variable. So that's on the loan side of the equation.
So you're right, our 10-Q disclosures have a very static approach. So, there's no growth in balance sheet. And
one of the things that's missing in that analysis is what happens to our growth related net interest income. So
obviously, you saw that we have 12% loan growth this past year. So that's not included in the analysis and not –
nor is any rotation from the Fed account balances today that are earning 15 basis points into loans or investment
securities.
So, it's a very static way of looking at it. The best way I can point to you, Chris, is – so if you look at our
disclosures for 100-basis-point move on an $800-plus-million net interest income run rate, we expect 1% benefit
in the first year and 6% benefit in the second year. So, you can kind of do the math on what that means for every
25-basis point move.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And on the indexed deposits, just given the structure of your balance sheet, I mean, how is – what's
the thought on retaining all these deposits versus remixing the balance a little bit more aggressively?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, I mean, there's a lot going on there. I mean, some of those are contractual and some of them I would call
are soft indexed in the sense that they're bid accounts and we can remove them if we need to, etcetera. So ,it's
kind of a mix – it's a mixed bag. Most of our business is relationship based and we'd like to keep as much of it as
possible and just worry more about what we do with the other categories on the balance sheet, such as putting it
to work in loans and what we do with the investments.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2022
So, we're – as we always have been, we're a little more willing maybe than others to take the pain to continue to
build the company. The value of this franchise is really in our deposits. And so, we don't really like to play games
for ratios. We want to build the business for the long haul.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for that. I guess I have two final ones. First is on your securities reinvestments. The rate you put
money to work ticked up from 1.28% to 1.46%. Where are reinvestment yield opportunities today, Ram?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. It depends on the duration, really, Chris. So if I want to stay short of three years, I can get 1.50%. If I want
to go a little longer close to six years, I can get 1.90%. So the range of outcomes, they don't – again, we're talking
about it live. Those are the options we're looking at in terms of trying to manage our duration, trying to manage
our interest rate risk.
So I would say, if you look at the next 12 months, I think the cash flow roll off is at 1.80%. Based on our current
yields and based on where the tenure is, we can get pretty close to that in terms of our reinvestment, again,
depending on the mix that we do of duration.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yes. Perfect. And then finally, the operating – I want to come back to the operating leverage comment. I think you
said ex-PPP with and without rates positive operating leverage, could you just speak to just magnitude? If we do
get the forward curve, it would seem like that would widen decent – by a decent amount. But, again, I'm not sure
what the assumptions are to reinvest
into the business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, we don't give specific guidance and we've been saying this or Mariner has been saying this for a better part
of the three quarters, right, even before the rate cycle or what the Fed has done lately with – so, our budgeting
process always assumes that we want to gain operating leverage. We have a lot of investments going in the fee
income side. And obviously, as you can see from the financial results, those are bearing fruit.
So, regardless of the environment, we want to be able to generate positive. And then the [ph] dues (00:35:51)
would really come if the rate environment changes dramatically if the Fed does 50 basis points, for instance,
instead of 25 basis points or there are four rate hikes in 2022. So, either way, I think we're well-positioned with or
without the benefit of rates. Just to give you a magnitude of this point, again, I go back to a lot of expenses, as
you saw in the fourth quarter, tend to be variable in nature. So, if we do well on the revenue side, expenses can
grow as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
