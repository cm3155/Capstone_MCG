MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Begoña Morenés
Global Head-Investor Relations, Banco Santander SA
Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Banco Santander's Conference Call to discuss our Financial Results
for the First Nine Months of 2023. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation that we will be
following today are available to you on our website. Let me just highlight that during the presentation when we
refer to global and network businesses, we are following the definition which was given during our Investor Day
last February, as the new reporting and full management of the group through global businesses will begin in
January 2024.
I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Héctor Grisi; and our CFO, Mr. José García Cantera. Following their
presentations, we will open the floor for any and all questions that you may have in the Q&A session. [Operator
Instructions]
With this, I will hand over to Mr. Grisi. Héctor, the floor is yours.

Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Begoña. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me share with you what we will
focus on today. First, I'll talk about our nine months results in the context of how we are progressing with the
strategy we outlined at our Investor Day. José will then review our financial performance in greater detail and then
I'll conclude with a few closing remarks.
As you can see, we had another strong quarter, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our unique business
model even in times of market volatility, as well as a solid execution of our strategy. We delivered record profit of
€2.9 billion. That's an increase of 20% compared with Q3 in 2022. That's 26% in constant euros.
Profit for the first nine months of 2023 was €8.1 billion, up 13% in constant euros, driven by strong customer
revenue growth. Revenue increased by double digit year-on-year supported by all global businesses and all our
regions. Commercial activity remained solid. We added 9 million new customers in the last 12 months, bringing
the total to 166 million. We continued to advance towards a simpler, more integrated model through our One
Transformation, which is leading to efficiency improvements and growth in profitability. As a result, our efficiency
ratio improved 1.5 percentage points year-on-year to 44%.
Our return on tangible equity rose 126 basis points year-on-year to nearly 15%, while our earnings per share
improved by 17% year-on-year, supported by profit growth and share buybacks. We further strengthened our
balance sheet generating capital in the quarter, even after deducting the share buyback underway and liquidity
remains at comfortable levels and credit quality is quite strong. All of this led to strong shareholder value creation
and attractive remuneration. TNAV plus DPS grew 12% during the last 12 months and we have increased the
cash dividend per share by 39% year-on-year.
Moving to the income statement, as always, we present growth rates in both in current and constant euros. Profit
increased strongly continuing the positive trends of previous quarters, supported by, first of all, strong top line
performance with growth in all our global businesses. We have improved efficiency as cost increased well below

revenue reflecting our transformation efforts. Double digit growth in net operating income to more than €24 billion.
Normalization of loan loss provisions in line with our expectations. And as I mentioned in the previous slide, these
trends resulted in our highest quarterly profit on record, 9% above that of Q2 2023. José will go now into more
detail on these points later.
These results maintained us on track to achieve our 2023 targets, targets that we reiterate. First of all, good
business dynamics led to double digit revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved and remains at the lower end
of our target range even with investments in One Transformation. A strong balance sheet with cost of risk
normalizing as expected and capital ahead of target with CET1 improving quarter on quarter. Our RoTE is close
to 15% and should comfortably reach our target at year-end.
Looking closer at capital and value creation, our CET1 ratio has grown year-to-date from 12% to 12.3%, backed
by strong organic capital generation after investing in profitable growth, absorbing regulatory impacts and
remunerating our shareholders according to our dividend policy. We continued to grow our shareholder value
creation, which was up 12% in the first nine months of the year. And we're increasing our shareholder
remuneration with payout up to 50%.
In September, the Board of Directors approved an interim distribution against our first half results, which is being
executed as follows. A cash dividend of €0.081 per share to be paid in November, 39% higher than the equivalent
in 2022, our share buyback program of up to €1.3 billion that is currently underway. Since 2021, and after
completing the current program, Santander will have bought back 9% of its outstanding shares buybacks –
through share buybacks.
We are progressing in our new phase for value creation, transforming the bank in the right way by changing our
model to improve both cost and revenue. One Transformation, which implies creating a common operating
platform and technology for our retail and commercial business across all of our geographies, will lead to
improved customer service, efficiency and profitability. In simplification, we have reduced the number of products
by 8% in 2023, that's almost 800 less products. In digitalization, we're making good progress with our digital self-
service model, increasing the availability of products and services in our digital channels and reducing the use of
our contact centers by 16%. We have setup a fully digital end-to-end onboarding process in Mexico that takes just
6 minutes to complete. Since its launch in July, we have opened 36,000 new accounts. In the US, we have
already captured around $114 million in savings from transformation and simplification. As you can see on the
slide, the initial efficiencies from One Transformation and the impact of our active spread management in a
context of higher interest rates have already contributed [ph] 117 basis points (00:07:52) in efficiency
improvements.
Our global and network businesses contribute to the group's profitability. And have delivered [ph] 39 basis points
(00:08:03) in efficiency gains. For example, Multi-Latinas and Multi-Europeans, initiatives to better serve our
multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model are growing at very high rates, with
revenue up by 50% (sic) [53%] (00:08:19) in 2023 year-on-year. In Private Banking, we continue boosting
collaboration with CIB and corporates, which has generated over $160 million revenue this year, or 13%.
In Brazil, we had acquired 117 new relationships that brought BRL 6 billion in net new money. In Payments,
Getnet already operates in five countries. We expect implementation in Chile in the next few months and in the
UK in 2024. In Auto, we continued to strengthen our relationships with global OEMs. Since January 2023, we
have expanded three of the – our OEM partnerships to new countries.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Finally, our global technology capabilities have already resulted in a [ph] 29 basis points (00:09:12) improvement
in the efficiency ratio. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture [ph] €125 million (00:09:21)
savings this year, €55 million from the recent deployment of Gravity, €60 million from the new global agreements
with vendors and €9 million from the implementation of new IT and ops shared services.
Let's look at how One Transformation is reflected in cost and operational efficiencies. Simplification is driving
significant improvements in our cost and revenue per active customer. Process automation is enabling us to
spend less time in operations in branches and turn this into a powerful sales and advisory channel. Since our
Investor Day, we have reduced the number of operational FTEs per 1 million customers by [ph] 5% (00:10:12).
We are already deploying global tech platforms to improve customer experience, leverage economies of scale
and spread best practices. We have implemented across the group proprietary backend Gravity already deployed
in three countries and CIB. This is delivering €55 million in efficiencies in 2023 and we have executed 75 billion
transactions this year alone. That's 10% of the group's total. We're expanding our cards platform across the
group, delivering real-time digital processing capabilities to our banks, and accelerating our business growth, and
will generate operational synergies of around [ph] €100 million (00:10:54) per year when it's fully deployed.
Finally, we are being able to transfer the best-in-class products and processes from the country of origin to the
rest of the group, which leads to a strong value creation.
The contribution of our global and network businesses is clear. In CIB, we continued to grow strongly. Our global
presence has allowed us to grow revenue by 21% year-on-year as we provide a one-stop shop service to all our
clients, capturing cross-border flows and making CIB products and services available to all wealth, retail and
commercial customers across the group and vice versa. As a result, revenue from these two concepts or network
revenue grew by 27%, year-on-year to €3 billion.
Wealth Management & Insurance grew revenue 22% year-on-year, well above target, boosted by benefits of the
Santander network effect. In Private Banking, a fundamental part of our value proposition is that our customers
can move and transact easily from one country to another. Today, customers have €52 billion of assets under
management booked abroad. That's 12% higher than a year ago.
Our Payments business is growing strongly and faster than the market. Our Payments Hub has become one of
the largest processors of account to account payments in Europe. Spain, the UK and CIB are already processing
a significant payment volume through PagoNxt while we execute full migration of all the group's A2A payments in
the next 18 months.
In Auto, we continued to prioritize profitability over market share growth in a context of rising interest rates. Global
Auto revenue was affected by lower lease income in the US and the new regulation in Germany. One
Transformation is now being extended across the group and the increasing contribution from our global and
network businesses are helping us to reach our 2025 profitability target across regions and businesses. Some
geographies and businesses have benefited from rising rates and they should continue to do so in 2024.
As for those countries and the businesses that do not benefit from higher rates, they are already showing signs of
improvement. This diversification, which is a clear competitive advantage, will lead to consistent profitable growth
and value creation. The group's RoTE rose 126 basis points year-on-year to around 15% as mentioned before.
José will go now in more detail to the Group's performance. Thank you, José.

José Antonio García Cantera
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Hector and good morning, everyone. I will take you through the main lines of the P&L in more detail.
Starting with revenue, there was strong growth driven by customer revenue again this quarter, which made up
more than 95% of total revenue and explained almost all the growth in the quarter.
This was primarily supported by our retail business as we actively managed interest rate tailwinds in Europe and
Mexico and due to the positive fee performance in Latin America. We delivered double-digit growth across most
businesses, in particular, our network businesses, which made up 38% of total group revenue.
The only exception was Auto, which was affected by lower leasing income in the US. Revenue at the corporate
center also improved by more than €500 million year-on-year due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and a
lower impact from FX hedging. Most of our revenue growth came from NII, which continued its upward trend,
increasing 7% in the quarter, driven mostly by Europe and Mexico.
We see upside potential for further growth in the coming quarters. Nine month 2023 was 16% higher year-on-year
in constant euros on the back of positive sensitivity to rising rates, mainly in Europe and Mexico and volume
growth in DCB North America and South America.
In terms of profitability, we have improved our net interest margin every quarter since the first quarter of 2021.
Gains from credit yields out-weighted higher funding costs, thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration,
leading to a clear margin expansion.
In Europe, we are strictly managing deposit costs, especially, in Spain and Portugal where there is excess
liquidity in the system and lower credit demand. The UK has a more competitive environment, but betas remain in
line with our expectations. In South America, deposit rates are more directly linked to market interest rates, which
results in negative sensitivity to raising rates. Therefore, as interest rates are starting to decline, we are seeing
improved NII trends.
In North America, in the US, betas continued to increase although in line with our expectations while net interest
margin in Mexico expanded. Going forward, in Europe, we expect further benefits from portfolio repricing in the
context of stable interest rates or a slight increase which we expect will more than outweigh potential cost of
deposit growth at least in the first half of next year. At the same time, as I said, we expect to benefit from interest
rate cuts in South America.
Turning to fees. In an environment of low fee income growth in general, as a result of subdued loan demand and
weak consumer activity, our net fee income grew 9% compared to the third quarter of 2022 and 6% year-on-year
with good performance across regions and businesses. Retail Banking grew well supported by a larger customer
base and are tailored and targeted value propositions.
Our global network businesses represented 42% of total group fees with corporate investment banking and
PagoNxt leading the way in terms of growth. Corporate investment banking is increasing its share of leading roles
and PagoNxt continued to expand its businesses, increasing total payment volumes 24% year-on-year and
transactions, 32%.
Wealth Management & Insurance was slightly up as customers moved to lower value added funds than bringing
lower fees. However, we saw increased activity in both Private Banking and Santander Asset Management with

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
three consecutive quarters of positive net sales. Auto performance increased year-on-year driven by good
performance in all our main markets.
In terms of cost, savings from One Transformation initiatives, which will become more evident in the coming
quarters, are already offsetting our investments in tech and digitalization. Group cost declined 0.5% real terms.
And driving down the transaction cost per active – the transactional cost per active customer, 2% in real terms, as
Hector mentioned earlier.
This, in turn, is reflected in efficiency gains led by Europe which improved 6 percentage points with cost flat in real
terms. In North America and DCB, cost increased slightly in real terms, reflecting investments to accelerate
transformation. Additionally, costs were also slightly affected by some perimeter effects such as the incorporation
of APS in the US and MCE Bank acquisition, a new Stellantis agreement in DCB. As a result, group efficiency
remains at the bottom end of our target range where we expect it to stay for the rest of the year.
Credit quality remains robust across our footprint and in line or actually slightly better than our expectations, which
is supported by strong labor markets and resilience in used car prices in the US. The NPL ratio was stable and in
line with expected levels and we remain comfortably on track to meet our 2023 cost of risk target of less than
1.2%.
Spain continues to perform well with a 12-month cost of risk down 9 basis points year-on-year supported by the
quality of the loan book and resilient economic conditions. In other units such as the UK, Portugal, and the Digital
Consumer Bank, the cost of risk is normalizing from very low levels and we expect it to remain below or in line
with through their cycle averages. Mexico is also increasing, although it remains at comfortable levels mainly due
to a change in mix towards unsecured loans in line with our strategy to improve profitability.
Normalization continues in the US in line with expectations. As we mentioned last quarter, cost of risk in Brazil
seems to have reached a turning point. The 12-month cost of risk decreased for the second quarter in a row and
the NPL ratio improved 28 basis points in the quarter, reflecting the improving macro conditions and our focus on
more secured and high rated customers.
To close with our balance sheet structure, we have discussed in previous presentations, our credit portfolio is
well-diversified by segment, product, and country. Our balance sheet is low risk. The portfolio is highly secured
with quality collateral and has loan-to-values -- average loan-to-values. Loans decreased 2% year-on-year as a
consequence of higher interest rates, reducing credit demand, and driving early repayments, especially, evident in
Europe and especially evident within European mortgages.
Positive dynamics continued in North America, South America, and DCB. On the other hand, deposits continue to
grow well a 4% year-on-year and 2% in the quarter as deposit inflows more than offset mortgage prepayments.
Growth in the year was concentrated mainly in time deposits, as customers seek higher rates. Our deposit base is
diversified and highly stable. Using LCR criteria, 75% of our deposits are transactional, which are stickier and a
high proportion of our deposits from individuals are covered by deposit guarantee schemes.
Mutual funds rose 11% with broad-based growth across all countries except the US following a year of instability
in 2022.
Our fully loaded capital ratio improved to 12.3%, but by strong organic generation of 45 basis points in a quarter,
which included 33 basis point charge in shareholder remuneration, 21 related to the latest program of share
buybacks that we are currently executing and 12 basis points for the cash dividend accrual.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
We continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities and this was reflected in a front book return on risk-
weighted assets of 2.7%, up from 2.5% in the first nine months of 2022, equivalent to a return on tangible equity
above our current group return on tangible equity, which will support profitability going forward.
Additionally, we continue to increase balance sheet mobilization and the percentage of risk-weighted assets with
positive economic value-added progressing well towards our Investor Day target of 85% in 2025. Increased
profitability will help us continue to build capital over the next few years. We are confident our fully loaded capital
ratio will remain above 12% even after taking into account the final implementation of Basel III in 2025 on a fully
loaded basis.
That's all from my side. Hector, over to you. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José. To wrap up, these are the messages I will leave with you. Q3 was another strong quarter with
customer and double-digit revenue growth supported by all regions and businesses. We're accelerating One
Transformation towards a simpler and more integrated model, which is extracting value from our global and
network businesses, driving efficiency gains and profitable growth.
We have strengthened our balance sheet and increased our CET1 while credit quality remains strong in line with
our expectations. All of these contributes to double-digit growth in shareholder value creation and increase
remuneration and will remain on track to meet our 2023 targets.
The execution of our strategy, the progress we are making in our platforms and our local leadership makes us
confident we can continue to grow and to increase profitability. We see further upside potential for NII growth from
the portfolio repricing and potential interest rates hikes in Europe and positive outlook for the margins in South
America.
Efficiency, already at the lower range of our 2023 target is expected to keep improving our revenue and cost as
we increasingly realize One Transformation benefits. We expect the cost of risk to end the year better than target
and we expect it to remain at similar levels in 2024.
At our Investor Day, we set our RoTE target of 15% to 17%. We expect to reach our RoTE above 15% by the
year-end and continue to improve significantly during 2024. And we see our fully loaded CET1 clearly above 12%
target even after the implementation of Basel III in January 2025.
As a result, we expect to progress in our target of double-digit shareholder value creation through the cycle,
further supported by our last step towards a full implementation of One Santander, which will enable us to fully
capture our in-market and global value.
And now, thank you. We would be happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We already have the first question from Francisco Riquel from Alantra
Equities. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. I want to focus on loan growth. In Spain, has been particularly weak. It's
down 10% year-on-year. The sector is minus 3%. I see that most of the fall is related to CIB, which is down over
20%, but SMEs and mortgages are also weak. If you can comment [ph] the gap (00:26:10) with the sector. We
know demand is weak, but you are below the sector [indiscernible] (00:26:14).
More broader in other regions, I mean, loans in the UK are also down 5%. The sector is up 1%, Brazil is up by
3%. The sector is growing 9%. So if you can elaborate whether you are prioritizing margins over volumes, if you
are more prudent on risk taking at this point in the cycle. So, loan growth in general [ph] and investment
(00:26:39) in particular. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Francisco. Yes. Basically, as you have said, loan growth has not been good in the – all the year, I
would say. Spain, mainly, as you basically say, is also being affected but prepayments in some of the mortgages.
If you see the portfolio of mortgages, we have seen, I mean, normally basically we go down [ph] 3.5% (00:27:06).
These basically we have had prepayments up to €6.5 billion so far this year.
And you're right, SMEs and mortgages basically have been not demanding credit as much. I believe people are
being cautious in the way and trying to see how the economy evolves even though employment has continued to
be strong and demand continues to be strong. This is a fact. And we have seen the clients basically being
cautious.
Nevertheless, if you see our portfolio in the rest of the countries, mainly Latin America has continued to grow.
There, we have been maintaining and being very, very cautious in credit appetite, but also very focused on
profitability. So [indiscernible] (00:27:56) the portfolio in Latin America in a very good way, but in a profitable way.
And also, you have seen that DCB has increased and has a substantial good development during the year and
we continue to see that over the next few months. So all in all, we are 2% below in loans this year, but we foresee
that once clients basically see that rates are starting to stabilize and the market basically has a more clear view of
what's going on, I believe that credit will come back little by little. I don't know, José, if you would like to
complement.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
No. Just one final comment. Risk-weighted assets are down €2 billion in the quarter, but is exclusively due to FX.
So if we look – if we exclude FX impacts on risk-weighted assets, risk-weighted assets are actually flat in the
quarter, which is what matter most for profitability and capital.

Begoña Morenés A
Global Head-Investor Relations, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Next question from Antonio Reale from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Antonio Reale Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good morning, everyone. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions from me, please. The first one is on
the profitability outlook and the second one on asset quality in the US. So starting with the first one, you've
reiterated your guidance for the full year, which, if I'm not mistaken, implies a net profit of around €10.9 billion for
this year. Can you confirm that's right? And how do you see profitability in 2024? It will be great if you could talk to
us through how you see the main units performing into next year, particularly, Europe, Brazil and the US.
My second question is, with respect to asset quality in the US, there was a big uptick this quarter. And you've
been talking about normalization cost of risk [ph] and we've seen lower (00:29:55) used car prices and higher
delinquencies. But neither of them were material changes. So my question is, what's driving this? Can you talk a
bit more about what you're seeing specifically on asset quality?
And related to that, [ph] I see you've confirmed your (00:30:07) 200 basis points cost of risk for this year. What do
you expect this number to look like next year? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Yes. Thank you, Antonio. Okay. On profitability, as I said during the presentation, I reiterate the 15% royalty. So
that basically gives you the numbers that you're looking for. Okay. So in that sense, we're pretty comfortable on
that. On 2024, as I basically said, we see also the portfolio repricing. So we see on a strong first half of the year in
Europe and then we see a strong second half of the year in Latin America, when we see basically the dynamics
changing.
And you have seen that and you've seen that in the numbers of this quarter when basically you have seen Latin
America basically performing better. Okay? So in that sense that can give you a very good idea and José will give
you more details on that.
In terms of asset quality in the US and I've been saying all along that in the past few quarters, it's very important
to understand that it's always seasonal. If you take a look of what happened last year in the third quarter, it was
actually the same and we expected that and we told you so. And what is important to tell you that is actually better
than we expected. And also it's not going to go beyond the 200 basis points, as you [ph] correctly point
(00:31:31).
In that sense, also, we see that the portfolio is performing better in the sense that we see that people with 90-day
delinquencies or above. [indiscernible] (00:31:45) used to happen is, we used to repossess about more than 90%
of those cars is basically performing much better. And we are repossessing between 60% and 65% of those.
If the trade continues like that and used car prices in the US continue like that, we expect better performance than
we normally expect. It's important that you understand that we have a completely different mix today in the
portfolio. The portfolio that we had pre-COVID didn't have as much prime and near prime as we do today. Our

prime and near prime is at around 41% of the mix of the portfolio. Though, that basically tells you that we expect
the asset quality to maintain at good levels. And also, the US has been performing with a strong employment as
well and the dynamics as well. So, in that sense, I'm comfortable with the numbers we're giving you.
José, please, would you like to complement on the profitability?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. Just one final comment on US asset quality. The cost of risk in 2019 was 2.85%. And given the changes in
the mix that Hector mentioned, we don't expect to reach those levels at all. And we would expect cost of risk in
2024 to be fairly flat, maybe slightly up to compared to 2023 in the US. In terms of profitability, well, we still have
negative sensitivity to rates in Latin America.
So rates start going down, we will see accelerated momentum in NII in Brazil in particular, coupled with higher
loan growth and flat or slightly improving asset quality. So clearly, the profitability in South America sector mention
is going to gain momentum throughout the year, with a much better second half relative to the first half. And in
Europe, as he said, we still have a lot to reprice on the asset side. That's one example.
In Spain, we have around €80 billion of mortgages, you know, that they reprice around [ph] 1/12 (00:33:58) every
month. Well, in fact, we reprice 60% of the total in the first half relative to the second half. So in the first half of
2024, we will still reprice a big chunk of our mortgage portfolio in Spain up year-on-year as they come to repricing.
So asset repricing particularly in Spain and obviously some beta pressure, some [indiscernible] (00:34:23) deposit
pressures with profitability still improving in the first half of the year. So when you look at the total year, we
actually, we remain constructive on profitability and profitability improving actually in 2024 relative to 2023.

Operator: Next question from Sofie Peterzens from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sofie Peterzens Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah. Hi. Here is Sofie from JPMorgan. Just to follow-up on the previous question. So could you just remind us
what the current deposit beta in Spain is and kind of how it moved in the quarter and also how you see the
deposit beta moving in the other geographies in the UK, US, and I guess, also Portugal. So, that would be my first
question.
And then, the second question would be around the US tax rate. It was very low this quarter. How should we think
about the US tax rate going forward and what the kind of normalized run rate? And then, if I may, just if you could
comment on any capital headwinds going forward. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Sofie. And [indiscernible] (00:35:59) could you explain us a little bit the second question because we
couldn't hear you well? First of all, on deposit betas, I mean, betas today in most geographies remain below the
initial expectations that we had, okay? And in general terms, they're behaving rather rationally and we expect

pressure to mount in the coming months and the betas to increase, I mean, it's normal because of the dynamics
of what's going on, okay? And the geographies [indiscernible] (00:36:24) different behavior. Our CFO will now
give you a little bit further details on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. Sofie, in Spain, total beta is slightly over 20%, 22%. But if we exclude corporate investment banking,
corporate investment banking is already almost fully priced. Ex-corporate investment banking is 13%. Remember
that we have €153 billion of current accounts in Spain with very low volumes. So – and the beta there is almost
zero. We don't expect any significant change in the behavior in the market in the coming quarters. So we would
expect the beta in Spain to gradually drift upwards, but very gradually, similar performance to what we have seen
this year.
In the UK, beta is 35%. If we look at the beta in the quarter, it's higher than that, it's around 50%. So, here we
would expect higher – gradually higher betas, but we are pricing assets also higher. The new mortgage pricing in
the UK today is around 5.7%. So, this is going to help withstand the slightly higher betas that we expect next year.
For the rest of the countries, Portugal at 9%, Poland 30%, and in the US is 32%. Ex-corporate investment banking
is 31%. Very much in line with expectations, not much to comment on that. So, bottom line is, we would expect
cost of deposits to gradually increase against repricing on the assets in some countries, particularly, in Spain also
in the UK, et cetera.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Sofie, in terms of the tax rate in the US going forward, what I could tell you and we could basically contact you to
give you more detail, I believe that we may improve it given that we are doing some leasing on electric vehicles
and that basically will help offset in the tax rate that we have outstanding today, okay? But to give you details,
later, we could call you and give exactly what's going on there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Your final question, capital headwinds. The only one is – the only significant capital headwind we have is the final
implementation of Basel III. Still some detail rulings or regulations need to be written, but bottom line is the total
fully loaded impact would be around 50 or 55 basis points. The phasing impact, so the charge on January 1, 2025
is going to be between 15 to 20 basis points. So again, very much in line with previous expectations, maybe a
touch better than when we expected.

growth, you were guiding before for a bit of an acceleration and you have been commenting into the quarter
results that we should expect better momentum in the second half. Did you see a moment to change your risk
appetite until we see an acceleration of growth also due to exchanges as we are seeing in Mexico? And what
should we expect for 2024 from Brazil?
And also, if you could share a bit of color on what has been the driver, of course, growth in Spain in the quarter
and whether we should expect some synergies coming from One Santander in coming quarters in Spain or it's
more restricted to Mexico and the US? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. In terms of what's going on in Brazil, Ignacio, a couple of points. First of all, what you have been
seeing is, as you remember, we changed a little bit the mix, okay? So we're changing a little bit that the cost of
risk is helping us out. First of all, because our – our some of them, the positions that we took – actually, the credit
loans that we gave are basically performing much better than we expected. And the mix also is helping us out,
because remember that the mix that we changed went a little bit into payrolls and to secure loans and the mix us
has also changed and is getting better. We're also seeing that the market is performing much better in terms of
LLPs.
So in that sense, we're opening it a little bit. I mean, we're open to a little bit more or of giving out loans in terms of
going back a little bit to the credit card markets. We are performing very well. But our credit appetite is cautious
nevertheless and we expect Brazil basically to perform really well in that sense, okay? So you're going to see
really growth in momentum also given that the rate is coming down and we expect the rates basically to continue
coming down over the next few months. So this is a double combination in terms of how we're managing the
portfolio and second, because of the way the rates are moving in Brazil. So in that sense, I believe it's going to be
much better.
In terms of the growth in cost in Spain, as you know, we have been implementing One Transformation, okay? So
with implementation of One Transformation, we're spending a little bit to transform a little bit some processes,
some things that we're doing and the way we're managing the bank in that sense. But you're going to see a much
better outcome in the next few months due to that fact, because we are – as you know, we are simplification –
we're doing simplification, dropping the number of problems that we have. We are doing also automation of many
different things and we are pushing our branches basically to move more towards businesses that look at the
incidence or problems.
So all that transformation that we're making is the one that is pushing us a little bit to spend a little bit more, but is
going to be in control and we expect that to continue drop in the next few months. So, in that sense, I feel
confident that we're going to be able to do that. Okay?
So in terms of – in Brazil, going back to just to that – just to tell you the second half is going to be much better
than the first half of 2024, okay? As [ph] we would (00:43:26) continue to go on and we build up the portfolio is
going to be performing much better, okay?
I don't know, José, if you would like to complement.

No, as I said, I think the sensitivity to rates gains momentum. So we have already started to see a slight change.
Rates have dropped just 100 basis points from 13.75% to 12.75%. We expect another 100 basis point drop in the
fourth quarter, but we would expect probably 200 to 250 basis points drop next year. So this accumulate. So,
when we look at year-on-year third quarter, fourth quarter, we will see rates probably 400 basis points down. So,
clearly the second half next year will look much, much better in terms of NII than the second half of this year.

Marta Sanchez Romero Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Good morning. Thank you very much. My first question is on restructuring charges. So I understand your
profitability target is underlying. And should we expect any material restructuring charges associated with your
new reporting structure? The second question is, your outlook on operating expenses in the US. You've gone on
a hiring spree of investment bankers recently. So what is the outlook for cost? And how much revenue do you
expect to generate as a result? And just quickly, on your effective tax rate in Brazil for 2024. And what is your
expectation regarding any potential changes on interest on capital? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Marta. No, we don't expect any restructuring charges at all, or because of the restructuring that we
just did in the organization. The other way around. Actually, we are moving towards lowering the cost as much as
possible in the organization. Okay. This is exactly what we're doing. It's very important to understand exactly what
One Transformation means, which means exactly simplifying, first of all. Okay. And simplifying the amount of
problems that we have significantly. Okay?
Second, basically, automation of a lot of the processes and this is mainly, I'm talking about on the retail side,
which is quite important. Okay? Which means, for example, transformation in countries like Portugal, where we
have already gone through a good, really good transformation, basically. Now 10% of the things we do in a
branch is basically operations and incidents and problems. 90% is taking care of the client. In other countries,
such as Mexico or Spain is 50% of that. So basically, this is what One Transformation means. And this is what
we're doing.
So simplification, automation, then we're going to come in with the platforms. You have seen a little bit what we've
been doing with the different platforms that we're deploying, for example, merchant acquiring that has been
deployed already most in Latin America. You'll see the costs coming down. And you see also that we are getting

revenue on quarter from our customers. So in that sense, it's very important that you understand where One
Transformation is and why are we doing this.
Second, in terms of – your second question was on operating expenses...

In the US.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
...in the US. Okay. Very important question. What we're doing in the US is just a complement of the rest of our
CIB business, okay? What do I mean by a complement? We have become a very large player in CIB. I mean,
large for the standards of Latin America and a very important player also in CIB in Europe. Okay?
It's important to point out that 94% of the business that we do there basically is client-oriented, okay? It's very
important to understand that. Just 6% is trading. So [ph] is client (00:48:13) flow is selling effects, is selling plain
vanilla derivatives, is doing a lot of trade finance to our normal clients, mid-sized and SMEs clients. And this is
basically – the only piece that we needed is basically was to complement the US.
This is not in any means to really beef up our presence in CIB in the US. These basically will complement the rest
of our business and also will give us capabilities in four or five particular sectors that complement the rest of the
business that we do in Latin America and Europe, in the US, which, by the way, we were not making because we
didn't have the capabilities.
So it's not a huge thing vis-à-vis the size of the group, but it's important that it's going to be an important revenue
generator. And you're going to see that revenue is going to start to pick up in CIB pretty fast given that, because
it's already a complement, as I was saying, of the rest of the business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Tax rate in Brazil next year, [ph] taxes on capital (00:49:14), that's been proposed and discussed, is not approved
and we are not sure that the final shape of that tax will be the one that was proposed. The finance minister
believes that they need to do a more detailed analysis on the impact of that, because the main reason for that is
to tax companies that are not paying taxes. The banks are paying already lots of taxes.
So I think, we need to wait and see what the final shape and form of that tax will take, but by no means, it's a
done deal and definitely not in the way that it was presented. Thank you, Marta.

Carlos Cobo Catena Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (Spain)
Hi, good morning and thank you very much for the presentation. [indiscernible] (00:50:27) a quick question on
revenue performance. You explained how NII has been the key driver of revenue momentum, however, going
back to the Capital Market Day, I remember, that it was a way stronger emphasis on fee income and non-NII
revenues, which seems to be underperforming a little bit or initial expectations. So could you elaborate on that? Is
that market momentum has weakened, but you see that being recovered in the future or simply that, there's some
– you are running behind your initial plan?
And second, when you talk about the cost of risk seasonality in the US, could you explain a little bit better why is
that? I mean, why there is such a concentration in provisions in the third quarter will be helpful to understand.
And lastly, on reporting changes, I don't know if you can share that already, but when you're talking about [ph] the
retail and (00:51:33) commercial new global business line. Could you explain if you plan to have also regional
P&L and balance sheets for each subsidiary which will be consistent with the consolidated global unit or we are
not going to have that detail? Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Carlos. I mean, I think it's important to understand basically the dynamics in the market, no. If you see
the fees, for example, in the first nine months, we grew 6% year-on-year. Okay? Is basically customer growth and
the global network business is basically helping out, no, mainly CIB and payments. Okay?
It's important to say that global and network businesses now contribute to around 42% of the total fee income.
Okay? And by 2025, that would increase from 42% to 50%. So basically, it's according to our plan. Okay? It's
important also that risk appetite increase is changing the portfolio mix. Okay? And volume growth and [ph]
transactionality increase (00:52:40) is going to help out. Okay?
And we see also – and you're going to see that it's going to complement the revenue exactly what you were
asking. You're going to see a strong CIB that is basically up 15% year-on-year. PagoNxt is a payment site and
merchant acquiring is up 12%. We have weaker wealth management that is around 1%, but it's market conditions,
you know, because it's exactly what's happening in the market. The Auto business is generating 5% more across
the board, okay? You see very good performance in Mexico and the US, and Europe is a little bit impacted by
regulatory changes.
And retail, you're going to see growth of around 5% year-on-year because we had active customers coming in
that are helping us out, mainly 2 million active customers that we didn't have, okay? So, in that sense, what I'm
telling you is that, we see that fees are going to starting to come up, also helping out by what's the dynamics that
we see in South America and Mexico mainly, okay?
So in that sense, you're going to see that, it's going to perform well. And also as credit picks up, that's also going
to help us in the fee revenue. That's basically what has been one of the levers, the fee revenue, okay?
The seasonality in the US is, has always been like that. I mean, that's basically the way people perform in this
particular market. I mean, it's a little different than it performs in Europe. And in that sense, it's always been
marked in the third and the fourth quarter and normally becomes a lot better when people get more money during
Christmas and start to pay us back, et cetera.

The dynamic that I basically explained, given that there is a very strong [ph] second hand (00:54:31) car market in
the US and also that people basically don't want to refinance their cars or don't see the availability of loans on
cars for the next few months. That basically [ph] should (00:54:46) help us out and that's why you'll see better
numbers. And I don't see the costs of risk going beyond the 200 basis points. And José gave you a very good
explanation of how – what's the level of the cost of risk before and what is it today and we expected to continue,
okay?
And also the change of mix is helping us out, okay? So it's very important for you to understand that, but this is
the way the market has been always. And you can see it if you go all the years behind. In terms of the reporting
changes, we're going to continue to basically show the countries as a secondary segment. Okay? So, you will
continue to have that information. I don't know, José, if I left anything out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
No, no, no. I think we will report as we manage the banks, so we will report these horizontal businesses as their
primary segments, obviously. But we will continue, as Hector said, providing all the information from a country
level upwards. So you will be able to see the country's performance organized by these businesses and the global
performance organized by country. So you will be able to have both views at the same time. Thank you, Carlos.

Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Hi. Sorry for earlier, a couple of questions. One is really a follow-up and thanks very much for your steer on
provisions for 2024. If I can sort of take advantage of – given you opened that door in the context of what we've
seen in the US within that flat provision, what directionally or a bit of color on how could we expect the US evolve
in 2024? And in particular, I took note of your data on repossessions. Now, 60%, 65%, it was 58%, I think you [ph]
reported (00:56:52) that number earlier in the year. How quickly do you think the repossessions are going to go
back to historical levels? Presumably, this is savings, COVID savings, and now, you have student loans picking
up.
Is that something we're going to see sort of going back to historical levels already in 2024? Or do you think it
could take more time? Just want to understand how you're thinking about the US within that [ph] flat group
(00:57:16) context?
And the second, hopefully easier one is on the UK. You've done pretty well considering some of your competitors
in the UK has been a bit of a car crash. Can you maybe talk about the outlook there specifically for UK, given
what we're seeing in the market, pretty tough competition on deposits? You had your own offer out in September.
So, maybe you got a bit more visibility now for Q4 and 2024? Thank you.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Yes. Thank you, Alvaro. Actually, I was expecting your question on the US. So, let me give you exactly what is the
important different dynamic that car has to student loans and different things. The car in the US is quite
interesting. It's not as in Europe as in Latin America. Actually, people in Europe and Latin America pay first the
mortgage and then the auto loan, et cetera. In the US, it's the other way around.
The US, if you don't have a car, you don't have a mean to go to work or to move around. I mean, you're
completely isolated. So the behavior of the auto loans in the US is completely different to anything you'll see,
because of this particular issue. Without a car, you cannot work and you cannot generate money. Okay? So,
that's exactly why the performance of the portfolio has turn it in that way, because people basically take a lot of
care to do that. And that's exactly why the behavior of delinquency is [ph] basically performing (00:58:49) that
well.
I mean, normally, if the economy complicates, you're going to see that number of 60% to 62%, 63% maybe going
up. Let's see how the US evolves and if we have a soft landing or not, that will all depend on that.
Also, it's important to acknowledge that we are changing the mix of the portfolio, as we have said already, no? So,
that's quite important because we are much more concentrating with the funding that we have from our bank to be
more in prime and in near prime. And even though we will continue to do subprime because it's a business that
we know well and we manage pretty well in the terms of risk [indiscernible] (00:59:31), but we are trying to change
a little bit the mix of the portfolio and also we are offloading some of that risk through asset sales, etcetera. So, it's
quite important to understand that we are really being very cautious about that and very cautious on the way we're
managing cost – sorry, cost of risk, okay? So, I hope I answered your question correctly.
And then on the UK, the UK, as you have said, we have performed well. We'll end up having a really strong year,
okay? We are working really hard to follow strategy in terms of cost. We are also, is very important, advancing of
One Transformation. We believe there is a huge opportunity there leading to [indiscernible] (01:00:12) and the UK
is leading probably to its best year in bottom line. But is important that you see that there is an opportunity there in
transform it and decrease the cost that we have in that country. So, I really do see the UK with a huge
opportunity. I was spending a lot of my time there because I believe there is opportunities. NII has grown year-on-
year 9.3%, is driven by higher rates, as you know, and strong – both, we have a really strong focus on managing
spreads and profitability, okay? So, you'll see that we have been lowering the portfolio of that because we're very
focused on that, okay?
You see then Q3, I mean, we are as the rest of the market, at 2.2%, both and we are offsetting the increased cost
of the retail funding and slow down of new originations by basically playing that and also using a different mix of
the portfolio and trying to see other opportunities, okay? It's important to tell you that we are putting profitability
ahead of market share, okay, and we have lower risk appetite, as I told you. And we believe that we could have a
NIM expansion by doing that.

Yes. Good morning. First question on, if you can remind us of the Brazilian interest rate sensitivity. Second
question is a follow-up on several questions from colleagues. If you can actually give us a concrete indication of
the structural tax rate in Brazil and in the US in light of the new electric vehicles leasing that you're doing. Is this a
structural move or is it just a one-off that we've seen?
Then on capital, given that you are confirming your 15% to 17% target with a 15% for this year, should we not see
also a natural acceleration in the organic capital buildup that you should be able to generate? And finally, digital
euro, what do you see as risks and opportunities from the digital euro implementation, have you budgeted the
impact to your business model and can you share it with us? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Andrea. Let me do the following thing. Let me answer your question on the digital euro and then José
will basically talk about the structural tax rates and the capital, okay? First of all, it's quite important to understand
that the European Commission has published a proposal of regulation last June, okay, which basically sets a
framework and it's a necessary condition for the digital euro to be launched. Okay?
They have publicly stated that discussions should not be rushed ahead of European elections in June 2024. And
they're saying that instead they will examine in a quiet and slow way by the new commission and the new
parliament. So, we expect a long negotiation process to achieve a common agreement in that sense. In parallel,
what we have seen is the ECB has just finalized investigation phase of the digital euro, as they said. The
governing council published last week the results and they decided to initiate a two-year preparation phase, as we
have heard, basically focused on the actual implementation of it. It will involve finalizing in the rule book and the
selection – selecting providers that could develop the infrastructure, it is quite important. And this phase will pave
way to a potential future decision on issuing the digital euro or not, but we see that it's going to happen.
And as a decision on the digital euro, [ph] I don't believe – will not be (01:04:14) taken before the regulatory
proposal is approved. So, I [indiscernible] (01:04:17) to its release before 2026, no. On this context, I mean also
as Banco Santander, we are aligned with the European authorities to design the European – the digital euro, also
develop the pan-European integrated payments market is basically very important. We believe we generate value
for consumers, companies and the financial institutions. And it's also important to say that we will continue to
monitor the potential impact digital euro may have on our banks in Europe and also is important for us to have
greater clarity as the ECB and the European Commission finalize the regulatory proposal and implementation
phase, okay? So that's the way we see it at this point. With this, I will basically pass it to José to tell you.

Hello, Andrea. Brazil, interest rate sensitivity is €150 million to a drop of 100 basis points all things being equal.
Tax rate, the – in terms of structural tax rate for the group going forward, I think using 30% is the right number.
This year is going to be a bit lower because of the tax benefits on EV in the US.
And then organic capital, well, the higher the profitability, obviously the higher the organic capital generation. We
don't expect any significant regulatory charges other than the ones we mentioned. And obviously always subject
to available for sale [indiscernible] (01:05:56), etcetera, but we don't see any significant inorganic or extraordinary
charges to our capital buildup. So you're right, I mean, the higher the profitability, the better.

We also have a very strong focus on asset rotation. We have started a team that is going to be looking at ways of
optimizing risk weighted assets across the group. In the first nine months of this year, we have already rotated the
equivalent to around [ph] €15 billion to €18 billion (01:06:34) in risk weighted assets. We think we can do more or
less [ph] €30 billion – close to €30 billion – €25 billion to €30 billion (01:06:39) this year. And that will be the focus
going forward.
The focus will be to rotate the balance sheet because we may not be the best [ph] tenors (01:06:50) of some of
the assets that we have in our balance sheet so – on our balance sheet. So, the focus going forward is going to
be the optimizing risk weighted asset consumption and maximizing profitability. So, you're right that we would
expect the capital build up to accelerate in the coming quarters.

Pablo de la Torre Cuevas Q
Analyst, RBC Europe Ltd.
Hi. And thanks for taking my question. I had a question on credit cards in Brazil. Could you please provide us an
update on the ongoing negotiations there between the banking sector and the central bank regarding the new
limits on installment and revolving credit card lending in the country? And if possible, could you please give us
any indication of the contribution to Brazilian NII of this type – to these types of lending and any estimates that
you can give us on the potential P&L impact of the new measures announced? I guess besides the negative
impact to NII, are the measures also likely to impact fee income from lower transactionality? And are there any
offsets there like lower cost of risk or lower cost of funding that we should also think about? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Pablo. José will tell you basically [ph] about (01:08:24) the situation in Brazil. Again, these are
ongoing negotiations. I just already referred to interest on capital. Here again, the focus is more on corporates
than financials. Obviously there might be an effect on banks, but that's not the main focus. But in our case, it
would have a relatively minor impact if it was approved as, as it has been proposed, but again, we think that will
change credit cards. The 90-day period for self-regulation is already counting and is finalizing by year-end. We do
not expect an agreement here, so probably [indiscernible] (01:09:04), the bankers' association in Brazil – sorry,
the Central Bank in Brazil, will have to regulate.
There is a not minor possibility that we will go to a modeling which total interest paid by the customer is capped to
total principal, which is called the UK model. Again, Santander and FEBRABAN, the bankers' association are
already working with the Central Bank of Brazil to try to find a best solution. It's very early to comment on the
impact because this type of regulation could have an impact on NII. But there may be ways of offsetting these
through commission income, etcetera, because there is a lot – a significant rotation of the balances in Brazil. So
again working on all of these very early to put numbers to these changes.

Operator: Next question from Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank BPI. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos Peixoto Q
Analyst, CaixaBank
Yes. Hi. Good morning. Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank. Couple of questions from my side as well [indiscernible]
(01:10:25). So on NII, minor detail but – or in a minor geography, but in Portugal, you have a 40% quarter-on-
quarter increase in NII this quarter. I see that the improvement in customer spread is actually lower than in the
previous quarter and you do have an increase in the ALCO portfolio. But in any case, I was trying to see if you
could have some color on the rationale on what caused this evolution and also what should we expect in coming
quarters? And then on the UK, in NII as well, I'm sorry if I missed it, but I was wondering, do you expect
[indiscernible] (01:11:12) high-single digit increase in NII in the UK for this year? You expect that to be the case
still? And how do you see it evolving into next year? Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Carlos. NII, I mean, as you said, grew very strongly in Portugal, no? It's been helping us out
basically because of the repricing of the portfolio, the [indiscernible] (01:11:43). And I believe that it will continue a
good trend towards the end of the year if rates go up a little bit more in Europe, okay, so that will help out, and
then, we'll stabilize. And that's my view because we see that the rates will stabilize at some time and we will see
more growth in that sense. So, NII should stabilize in Portugal, okay? In terms of the UK, I explained you quite
well exactly what's going on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
If I may, before you go, just to give some more color on Portugal. When we look at yield on loans, in the fourth
quarter of last year, yield on loans in Portugal was 2.4%, 3.3% in the first quarter, 4% in the second, 4.6% in the
third. So, the yield on loans basically increasing almost at the same rate every quarter this year. Yield on
deposits, 4 basis points, 14 basis points, 26 basis points, 38 basis points. Also more or less growing at the same
pace.
So, one quarter, there's obviously seasonality, balances, number of days. All of these may explain the differences.
But again when you look at the trends, the trends in Portugal are very consistent. We would expect – as Héctor
said, obviously there is a limit to the repricing of assets and mortgages in Portugal contrary to Spain are linked to
the 6-month Euribor, not the 12-month Euribor in Spain. So, the flattening out on the asset side in Portugal is
going to happen a bit faster than in Spain. But again, the cost of deposits in Portugal is really, really low and we
don't see any competition there. So, we remain constructive in the next few quarters in Portugal.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José. Very quickly on the UK, Carlos. I mean, as I said basically, I mean, we continued to put
profitability ahead of market share, okay, and we have lower risk appetite given the dynamics in that market and
we combine that – and we'd like to combine that with [indiscernible] (01:13:40) performance. That basically could
lead to a NIM expansion. But answering your question, I expect 2023 with a high-single digit growth and on high
rates, management of deposit cost while we assume the lower volumes that we have, okay? And that's basically
the outlook that we have for the UK at this point. I don't know, José, if you would like to complement. But I think,
with that, I answered your question.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Britta Schmidt Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Yeah. Hi there. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one will be on the NII in Spain. The customer spread
widens and you've also increased the ALCO portfolio but the NIM was flat. So, maybe you can explain what's
happened there and also give us an update on the ALCO portfolio. And the second one will be on Chile. We've
seen a big decline in NII here. I think the business has guided to a big decline in profits this year. But what do you
think is the outlook there for this year? And also when will the NII improve in 2024? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you Britta. I will start, basically give you the overview and then José can give you a little bit more of details
on both, okay? I mean, Spain, as you say, is one of the countries that has benefited the most from the higher
rates, okay? And we continue to see, as I said, strong growth from clients, okay? We have 651,000 new
customers – net new customers in the last 12 months, okay? We see also a strong contribution from the global
businesses, okay? Wealth Management is increasing 84% year-on-year, CIB 11%. I'm talking about PAT. And
CIB is also achieving a substantial growth – a net margin growth mid-teens, maintaining superior profitability
levels, okay? So, you're going to see that. We expect double digit NII growth in 2023, okay?
And, in terms [indiscernible] (01:15:54) to consider. We see, as José explained you in detail, assets repricing at
least during the first half of 2024, okay? Clients continue to grow and [indiscernible] (01:16:06) particular issue.
We see no minimum – no meaningful deposit moments in Spain in reaction to prevailing rate. Here our deposit
base is extremely automized. 80% of our deposit base have an average balance of €20,000, which basically
contributes to the stability. Also, is very important to take into account that the One Transformation I explained is
going through in Spain as well. And we're very focused on product simplification. As I said, we're reducing 21%
the product portfolio. We're doing a process of optimization there, okay? But I see that exactly that's the trend that
is going to have exactly as José basically detailed. I don't know, José, if you would like to complement, but you
already gave a lot of detail.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. Britta, let me tell you, yield on loans, this is the same explanation that we have for Portugal. Quarter-on-
quarter, it basically has to do with many – many – probably many small things. But when you look at yield on
loans in Spain, from the fourth quarter of last year 2.5%, first quarter 3.3%, second quarter 3.8%, fourth quarter
4.3%. So very much almost an straight line increase. And in the case of deposits, also the same, 22 basis points,
53 basis points, 72 basis points, 19 basis points. In the last couple of quarters, 18 basis points, 19 basis points
increase. So, very much flat.
So, the point here is that we still have a substantial part of our balance sheet in Spain that will reprice up in the
first half of next year. I just used the figure for mortgages is €77 billion and around 60% reprices in the first half.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
So I think the yield on loans will continue although the rates – interest rates in Spain might stay – or in Europe
may stay flat, the repricing of assets in Spain will continue for at least the first half of next year.
And in terms of the pressure on the cost of deposits, again, most of institutional deposits, corporate investment
banking deposits have already repriced. So, the question is to what extent the cash balances in the current
accounts will move to time deposits? To what extent customers have excess liquidity in their current accounts to
be put aside for time deposits? And we think that is a limited – it's a very limited amount. So, we see not a lot of
pressure on that particular part of the business for increased cost of deposits.
In Chile. In Chile, we have two balance sheets, so two sensitivities to the balance sheet. One is to rates and the
other one is to inflation. Obviously, the relative movements of inflation and rates is what explains what we've
seen. So, we have seen already inflation going down, rates going down slower. So, as the inflation continues to
go down and rates follow, we will see the reversal. So, we see NII in Brazil actually expanding. Again, gaining
momentum towards the second half of next year but expanding substantial in the second half of next year relative
to the second half of this year, because again, the relative movement that we have between inflation, which is the
US and rates.

Hugo Cruz Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods
Hi. Thanks for the time. Hugo from KBW. Just couple questions. Mexico NII, the growth [indiscernible] (01:19:38)
to be quite strong. I guess I'm not going to ask you why it'd been stronger than expected, but I wonder if you could
give guidance on – for the full year, what kind of NII growth you expect in euros? And then, finally, on Argentina,
quite volatile and we have elections soon. So, I was wondering if you can give – what to expect an impact from
the elections, but also if you could give guidance on the earnings for this year and the next. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. Okay. Mexico, as you have seen, has been – had a strong growth in NII. It's a combination of many
things. First of all, the rates increase, but most of that is basically because of the change of the mix that we have
performed in the country, okay? We saw an opportunity of basically switching a little bit of the portfolio into credit
cards and our secured loans and payroll loans to individuals. So to have a much better structured mix than we
used to have before, okay? So, Mexico is helped out by the rates but also by the change of the mix of the
portfolio. All right? So, it's quite important to see that. We see that Mexico will continue to have a really good
trend. I mean, Mexico, as you have seen, has grown pretty well, pretty nicely over the past few months and I
believe it's going to grow strongly also in 2024. Okay?
The important thing to understand exactly how rates are going to perform, and that's going to depend a little bit on
what happens in the US. All right? Both I see that if rates continue to be stable and the economy performs well, I
believe that Mexico should develop very good on 2024 and continue to have very good growth on NII. Okay?

In terms of Argentina, as you have seen, we have a, I would say, complicated environment to say the least about
of what's going on. We really and I wouldn't like to basically make a prediction of what could happen, but looks
that may – things may stay as they are. We have, as you know, a potential difference between the – in the
exchange rate – between the official exchange rate and what's happening in the black market. So, in that sense,
let's see how it evolves and how the government would like basically to land the difficult task they have in front.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
No, the – just one final comment here. The way we've managed Argentina is to – we're trying to hedge obviously
against inflation and hedging our investment against inflation, and that will continue to be the key element.
Obviously, there is a big difference between official exchange rates and unofficial exchange rates. Well aware of
that. We are aware of the impact that a devaluation could have on our books. So, we are managing that to
minimize the impact if that was to happen. And obviously, again, the key is to preserve the value of our
investment in Brazil. But basically by managing and investing inflation risk.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Fernando Gil de Santivanes d´Ornellas Q
Analyst, Bestinver Sociedad de Valores SA
Thank you very much for taking my questions. Three quick ones, please. First one on Digital Consumer Bank. I
see return on tangible book at 11%, still a bit soft from the target of 15% that you have for the plan. Can you
please comment the outlook for 2024, please? This is the first one.
Second would be about the ALCO portfolio. I see an increase of about [ph] €10 billion (01:23:34) in the quarter.
Can you please address the strategy and the level of unrealized losses you have in the portfolio?
And finally on Poland, if you can please comment on the outlook for the [indiscernible] (01:23:44) please. Thank
you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
So, let me start with Poland. The proposal comes from the current government. We need – we're not – we are
going to have a new government and this will have to go to parliament. So, very early stages of this proposal and
I am almost 100% sure that some other form of proposal, if any, will be conducted, because again this is a
proposal of the existing government, not the upcoming government. The ALCO – sorry, also Britta asked about
this and I forgot. We have more or less [ph] €27 billion, almost €30 billion (01:24:26) of ALCO in Spain at an
average yield of around 3.4%. We expect to end the year at around [ph] €30 billion (01:24:39). We might increase
the ALCO a little bit more next year, obviously taking advantage of the higher yields. So, depending on how you
measure the profitability of this, if you measure these against average cost of deposits or against the marginal
funding cost, you have different profitability. But obviously this is going to add significant push to the profitability of
the group next year.
DCB, I don't know, you want to comment on DCB and the outlook for the business?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Yes. I mean, on the DCB, there has been a particular change in the business in the – this year, no?. In DCB, in
particular, there is one very important. We had really good growth in terms of loans, but the majority of those
loans – the vast majority is basically stock financing, okay, given the dynamics that the auto market has had over
the past few months. First of all, there was not enough production. Then, the production started. And now,
basically we are financing a huge amount of the car dealerships. We expect basically to start – that – dealerships
to start moving that inventory out and that basically will produce more – the normal auto loans and then will give
us the normal NII that we are accustomed to at this point, okay? So, that's basically the way we believe that this is
going to evolute. It is important to acknowledge that also we have been able to finance. A lot of this portfolio with
our own deposits instead of going that much to wholesale. And also you're going to see a dynamic or what José
was telling you about of selling a lot of these portfolios out into the market once we basically start out giving out
loans direct to individuals, okay? So, we believe that the outlook would be good. It's important to see also how the
economy evolves mainly in Europe, and that would also depends on how fast the inventories moved.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah, one final comment here. Although we have a neutral position into rates in DCB. Obviously, the higher the
rates, the more difficult the business is, particularly when rates start going up. So, once rate stabilize, the
business also stabilizes and increases the profitability. The difficult – the difficulty in managing DCB is when rates
actually go up. Because of that, we do not have sensitivity to that movement. Obviously, the customers do not
react well to do that. So, that one point I wanted to make. The other point is on cost of risk. We would expect the
cost of risk in DCB to gradually trend towards the normalized level of around 50 basis points a year, taking into
account that these will depend on asset sales, securitizations, etcetera. So, our aim is to try to minimize that, like
Héctor was saying, by managing the assets that we have on our books.

Ignacio Cerezo Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
Hi. Good morning. I've got three follow-ups. First one is on NII in Brazil. I mean, are you sticking to the guidance
you gave in Q2 that Q4 will be better than Q3? And if you can give a little of color in terms of pattern of NII
expansion next year, should we expecting like a linear increase through the year or you're going to have some
degree of seasonality at some point?
Second one is on the US. I'm sorry if you have mentioned that already, but what has driven the 13 percentage
point decline of the coverage in the quarter in the unit?
And the third one is on capital return, given your comments around accelerated capital generation as profitability
goes up and mindful of Basel IV, but do you see any chances of topping up your capital or increasing your
shareholder return in 2024? Thank you.

Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. Look, Ignacio, in terms of NII in Brazil, I think it's important, I mean, I will reiterate, first of all, as I have
seen the worst of the NII is behind us, we continue expecting an improvement both in NIM and NII in the coming
quarters, okay? Rates, as José explained you, have started to curve down, I mean, 100 basis points in the Q3
2023. Our numbers basically tell us that maybe they will come down towards the end of the year to [ph] 11.75%
(01:29:39). So, that basically tells you, we're flat in the Q2, declining rates plus credit activity increasing plus
market-related NII no longer a drag, NII improvements. So, that basically tells you that, yes, we believe that the
second – sorry, that the fourth quarter is going to be better than the third, okay?
In terms of what do we see in the future is exactly as José explained you, is that we see a trend going upwards
towards – more towards the second half of the year next year, okay? And that's the way we see it, is going to help
out if rates continue to come down and volumes continue to go up. Well, that's exactly the beauty of the
diversification model that we have at this point. All right?
In terms of the US coverage, okay, is basically – I mean, the normal seasonality [indiscernible] (01:30:37) loan to
values include recording value of the cars. Okay? And in addition, on the quarters, we have [indiscernible]
(01:30:48) rating of several companies in the sector, and in fintech, charges due to originations in that sense. But
I see that this would normalize towards the beginning of next year, as I said. Okay?
So, in that sense, I don't see a problem in that is – also, there was an increase in provisions mainly, as I said, I
mean, the LTV and the Stage 3 balance with a GST remediation. But other than that, I think [indiscernible]
(01:31:18) it was quite normal. Cost of risk, as I said, is 1.77%, okay, and is below the 200 basis points that we
indicated as guidance for the year. And total coverage ratio is [indiscernible] (01:31:36) portfolio is flat year-on-
year [indiscernible] (01:31:39). I don't know if that answers your questions. And in terms of the capital return,
please, José.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A

decide obviously.
