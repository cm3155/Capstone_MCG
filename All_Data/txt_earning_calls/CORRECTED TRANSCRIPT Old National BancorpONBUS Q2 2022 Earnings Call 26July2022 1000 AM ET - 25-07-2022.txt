Good morning. We're pleased to discuss our outstanding second quarter results and update you on our systems
and branding changes from our transformational merger. Let's start on slide 4. We recently completed our
systems and brand conversion. It's been a busy couple of weeks. The data and systems conversion went very
well overall, and our commercial clients have quickly and successfully adapted to the new systems. As expected,

our branches and contact centers have experienced elevated activity levels, but have started to normalize. I want
to thank all of our team members for their hard work and dedication to serving our clients and communities.
Completing the data and systems conversion should accelerate our ability to achieve our model synergies.
Brendon will fill you in on our progress later in the presentation. I'm gratified to share that despite the merger
activities, our teams achieved outstanding loan growth results and continue to build robust pipelines. I can't
imagine better result, especially given the distractions. Lastly, we started branding campaigns in Chicagoland and
in some of our metropolitan markets and are receiving good feedback from those efforts.
Moving to slide 5, we reported GAAP earnings for the second quarter of $0.38 per share. The second quarter
included pre-tax charges of $36.6 million in merger expenses. Excluding these charges from the current quarter,
adjusted EPS was $0.46 per common share or $135 million. Our adjusted average tangible common equity and
assets was a strong 20% and 1.21%, respectively. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was approximately 54%. Our
focused execution on our merger and growing our commercial business drove these robust results in leading
returns. We saw higher balances in nearly every portfolio and market across our commercial and community
banking business.
Total loan growth was 19%, and the commercial business grew 18% in an annualized basis. The higher loan
growth paired with the benefit of higher interest rates, primarily contributed to a 45-basis-point margin expansion.
Credit quality remains excellent, but we remain diligent with new credit request. Our pipeline ended at a record
$5.9 billion.
Overall, clients in our markets have strong balance sheets and continue to grow and expand, as evidenced by our
record pipeline. We were pleased to hold deposits quarter-over-quarter while maintaining our deposit pricing
discipline. Much of the government and municipal client stimulus funds are yet to be invested. Therefore,
balances remain high and grew during the quarter.
A quick update on hiring. We successfully welcomed 17 new client facing commercial and wealth management
relationship managers during the quarter. Our talent pipeline remains robust and we will continue to make more
new investments throughout the year. While 2022 continues to bring its own set of unique challenges, our
businesses are performing very well. Business and consumer sentiment are worsening slightly, but we remain
optimistic that our balance sheet will continue to grow. We are well positioned to withstand any new challenges.
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Brendon for further details.

Thanks, Jim. Turning to the quarter's results on slide 6. We reported GAAP net income applicable to common
shares of $111 million or $0.38 per share. Reported earnings were impacted by $37 million in merger-related
charges. Excluding these charges as well as debt securities gains, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.46.
Slide 7 shows the trend in total loan growth on a historical combined basis, excluding PPP loans. Q2 represents
our eighth consecutive quarter of organic loan growth, with total loans increasing 19% on an annualized basis,
driven by robust commercial growth of 18% and consumer growth of 22%. Growth within consumer loans was
driven by residential mortgage, which reflects lower saleable production and is net of a transactional book runoff
of $58 million. The balance of the transactional book at quarter end was approximately $1.7 billion.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2022
The investment portfolio decreased modestly by approximately $200 million quarter-over-quarter, with the overall
mix remaining largely unchanged. And I note we have deployed a significant portion of the cash outstanding at
the end of the last quarter in support of loan growth.
Investment for portfolio yields improved significantly to 2.37%, with new money yields of 3.68%. Effective duration
was stable despite the dramatic shift in the yield curve, with new money purchases focused on the shorter end. In
addition, we transferred another $1 billion of securities into our HTM portfolio to help mitigate future OCI impact.
Slide 8 provide further details of our commercial loans and pipeline. The strong second quarter growth was well
distributed, with 20% annualized growth in C&I and 16% annualized growth in CRE. We were also pleased that
despite the strong second quarter production, our pipeline ended the quarter at a record $5.9 billion, which is a
9% increase over Q1. Turning briefly to pricing, new money yields on C&I increased 80 basis points from Q1 to
4.2%, with new CRE production yields up 53 basis points to 3.67%.
Slide 9 shows details of our Q2 commercial production by product end market. The $2.2 billion of production was
well balanced across all product lines and major markets. The Chicago market continued its strong momentum
with nearly $1 billion of production but all of our legacy and expansion markets had strong quarters as well. In
addition, all of our product lines posted quarter-over-quarter loan growth, a clear reflection of the strong loan
demand throughout our footprint.
Moving to slide 10, end-of-period deposits were stable quarter-over-quarter, although we did see some
deployment of deposits in our commercial and retail clients that was largely offset by seasonal increases in
municipal and government funds. Total cost of deposits continues to be low at 6 basis points, up just 1 basis point
from the prior quarter. We are prepared to defend deposits through rate actions, if necessary, but we have ample
funding forces and active liquidity to support future commercial loan growth.
Next, on slide 11, you will see details of our net interest income and margins, both improved meaningfully due to
strong loan growth, improved earnings asset mix and higher interest rates. NIM expanded 45 basis points quarter-
over-quarter to 3.33%. Core margin, excluding accretion and PPP income, increased 34 basis points to 2.98%.
Slide 12 provides additional details on our asset liability position and projected margin range. Margin is expected
to continue to expand meaningfully over the next few quarters, albeit at a slower pace. The assumptions in our
outlook, including Fed funds' target rate of 3.5% at year end, a static balance sheet and deposit betas that
increased from 3% today to a December cycle-to-date beta in the range of 20% to 25%.
We believe we have opportunities to outperform this outlook through continued strong loan growth, remixing of
earning assets and a longer deposit pricing lag. Also, while we remain well-positioned for rising rates, we have
been proactively hedging the balance sheet over the last several quarters to protect our margin from the
possibility of a hard economic landing and quick reversal in Fed policy. We currently have over $1 billion in down
rate protection, including floors and collars, which we will continue to build over the remainder of the year.
Slide 13 shows trends in adjusted noninterest income, which was $89 million for the quarter, slightly better than
expected due to $4 million of discrete items related to equity investment returns and recovery from fully charged
off acquired loans that we don't expect to recur. Mortgage production was higher than anticipated. However,
normalizing gain on sale margins and a higher percentage of portfolio production did negatively impact the
[indiscernible] (00:08:46).

Next slide 14 shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses, adjusting for merger charges and tax credit
amortization. Noninterest expense was $239 million and our adjusted efficiency ratio was 53.9%. Expenses were
slightly higher than anticipated due to a year-to-date true-up of incentive accruals to reflect better-than-planned
performance. We continue to run slightly ahead of our planned cost synergies, but expect the bulk of the savings
to begin late third quarter. Merger charges are also tracking in line with our diligence estimates with approximately
$65 million remaining.
Slide 15 provides further details on our path to achieving the cost savings of $109 million. With the system
conversion now behind us, we have completed the last major milestone required prior to realizing the remaining
cost saves. Expectations on timing are unchanged, with 85% of the cost synergies on an annualized basis
realized in the fourth quarter and the remainder to come early in 2023. Note our 4Q run rate was updated to
include higher incentive related expenses resulting from better than planned performance.
Slide 16 shows our credit trends of both historical Old National and First Midwest. Credit conditions continue to be
benign, and our commercial and consumer portfolios continue to perform exceptionally well. We ended Q2 with
positive trends and better-than-peer results in all key credit metrics. Net charge-offs were a modest 2 basis points.
On slide 17, you will see the details of our first quarter allowance, which stands at $288 million, up from $281
million at the end of Q1. Reserve build was driven by strong loan growth and a more pessimistic economic
forecast, partly offset by lower specific reserves and improved asset quality in our commercial book. The financial
health of our clients remains strong, and while we are not seeing any signs of credit deterioration in our portfolio
today, we believe it is prudent to maintain elevated levels of qualitative reserves until the cloud of economic
uncertainty lifts. In addition to the $288 million in total reserves, we also carry $131 million in credit marks.
Slide 18 provides details on our capital position at quarter end. As you can see, it remains strong with a CET1
ratio of 9.9%. The modest 14-basis point quarterly decrease reflects robust loan growth, which more than offset
our strong retained earnings. We continue to monitor our balance sheet for economic stress and feel very
comfortable with our capital levels.
As I wrap up my comments, here are some key takeaways. We couldn't have scripted a better result in the first
full quarter following the closing of our partnership. Client and our retention has been exceptional, leading to
another quarter of broad-based positive loan growth led by our Chicago market. Rate increases brought welcome
margin expansion that was meaningfully higher than our peers. We recently completed the major systems
conversion off schedule, credit conditions remain benign and we are tracking ahead of our planned cost
synergies.
Slide 19 includes thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of 2022. We ended the quarter with a record
commercial pipeline which supports our favorable outlook on loan growth, albeit at a potentially slower pace in
Q2, given waning consumer and business sentiment. Net interest income and margins should benefit from
continued loan growth and Fed rate increases, consistent with the margin guidance we outlined earlier.
We expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well despite headwinds. We expect solid organic growth in
our wealth business, but AUM will continue to be under pressure from market fluctuations in both equities and
fixed income. Mortgages following industry patterns with fee revenue under pressure from normalizing gain on
sale margins as well as a higher percentage of portfolio production. Commercial activity should support continued
strong capital markets revenues. And lastly, we anticipate pressure on deposit service charges consistent with
industry trends. We are targeting adjusted Q4 expenses of $227 million and...

Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thank you. We are targeting adjusted Q4 expenses of $227 million and expect to realize the majority of cost
synergies by yearend. Credit conditions are benign, but we will continue to take a conservative approach to
reserves in the near term. Lastly, a brief update on taxes. We are expecting approximately $7 million of tax credit
amortization for the remainder of the year, with the corresponding full year expected tax rate of approximately
23% on a core FTE basis and 90% on a GAAP basis.
In closing, we believe we have strong earnings catalysts that should differentiate us from our peers as we finish
the year ahead into 2023. While the equity markets have us discounted relative to our peers, we believe this delta
should narrow as we continue to deliver commercial loan growth, execute on the promise cost synergies, maintain
our customary credit discipline, and leverage our best-in-class deposit franchise for better than pure margin
expansion.
With those comments, I'd like to open the call for your questions. And we do have a full team available, including
Mark Sander, Jim Sandgren and John Moran.

R. Scott Siefers Q

Likewise. No problem. I have to say, Brendon picked it back up without missing a beat. That was very impressive.

James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Well, there was a lot of drastic [indiscernible] (00:16:48) movement in the room, as you can imagine, but glad
we're able to complete the call. And I appreciate you coming back to your rightful spot as number one on the
question list, so good job.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you for that. No, I appreciate that. I wanted to ask just couple of questions. So, when you talk about the
loan growth outlook potentially slowing, I guess, I, sort of, meant that to mean just because the 2Q was just so
extraordinarily strong. And you noted in the written comments, in the outlook, client sentiment in there, I was just
hoping you could expand on that comment, what your customers are seeing and saying to you guys?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I'll give you a high-level view, and let maybe Mark or Jim jump in here. You know, just like everybody else, I
think we're cautiously optimistic that we will continue to close the pipeline but we can't take into account the
declining sentiment somewhat, higher interest rates, all those things are kind of weighing on our mind, but we still
feel really good about our pipeline. The fact that it grew to record levels still feels very good. And our clients are
innovative and they find ways to still get their deals done, but we are also just cautious like everybody else.
Would you like to add?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2022
Well, I would add, as you alluded to, we had a really strong second quarter. So expecting $900 million every
quarter perhaps might be a bit much, but the pipeline would indicate – and our clients, our commercial clients,
revenues and profitability would indicate that things are still quite strong out there and we grew the pipeline even
as we had a great second quarter. So in the near-term, I would say, we feel good about our outlook for loan
growth, but again, perhaps not at $900 million level. This quarter, we also got boosted a little bit by [ph] line
draws. Line draws (00:18:24) picked up a couple hundred million of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Wonderful. Thank you. And then if I can switch over to the funding side for a second? Virtually no increase
in deposit costs, which is great and appreciate the data commentary in the deck. Just curious what you guys are
thinking for deposit betas once the Fed stops raising rates? In other words, sort of the full through the cycle beta
versus the year end that you cite there. And then would be curious if there's any difference in pricing pressure that
you guys are seeing in the Old or sort of the legacy Old National footprint versus the newer Chicago portion of the
footprint?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Scott, I think pricing pressure is picking up a little bit, but not unexpectedly. We're starting to see it for the
first time. So we're getting the typical costs from the more price sensitive customers, and we're responding
accordingly. In terms of what the total beta is at the end of the cycle, it's hard to tell at this point. And we believe
we have a competitive advantage with our deposit franchise and our expectation is that we'll be better than the
average bank at the end of this. Right now, our models are showing it through the cycle around 25%, but we'll see
where it ends up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

It looks like I got dialed in 2 minutes earlier. Anyway, let me put the slide deck together, deserves a round of
applause, I think it's very, very helpful, just for the couple of new slides in there. So kind of just answering or
following up on Scott's question about deposits. When you guys think about the funding relative to the pricing, is
there any kind of pressure points that you guys are seeing? I guess now you have to balance both sides of the
balance sheet here, but is loan pricing still more of the headache or do you starting to see a little bit more
pressure on kind of the more sensitive clients that are calling a bit more frequently on the funding side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
I would say spreads on the loan side have held up quite well. So we're not seeing pressure there. And the deposit
side, I guess, we're anticipating it coming more than seeing it right now and we're going to stay competitive in our
marketplaces. And so, yeah, we won't be the first, but we won't be the last kind of thing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, in the guidance, you're assuming the Fed moves [ph] 75
(00:21:12) on Wednesday, but on Friday, when you get the first Q2 look on GDP and as a sneaky suspicion of
being a technical recession, does that change the way you guys are approaching overall growth across lending
categories? Is there any areas that you might be kind of pressing the gas or tapping the brakes to some degree
on just broadly speaking with loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Again, I'll jump in here, ask the team to follow up where I maybe don't get it right. But I don't believe so. Again, it's
a client-by-client situation. There are some clients and some industries that maybe you think are more vulnerable
that will continue to lend. And then there's some industries that we may be cautious about, but it really hasn't
changing our outlook at all, regardless of what the GDP numbers report.
Our clients overall are very healthy, whether it's the personal side or the business side, are overall very healthy,
continue to come into this very well prepared. And I don't think as I talked to other banks in our marketplace and
across the country, I don't think our approach is that much different than what I'm hearing from others. I think
we're all optimistic that we'll continue to have growth opportunities. And I think there's still very healthy demand
out there to continue to want to do business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got it. That was very fair. You guys never really had much of a credit issue, so it seems like we have good clients,
which is a big positive going into any kind of economic slowdown. The last one for me, I mean, you have a much
bigger balance sheet. Do you have any kind of new updated guideline [indiscernible] (00:22:53) guide rails or
anything like that for the loan to deposit ratio? And I'm assuming we're nowhere near the high end, but is there a
high end and where your comfort level would be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Well, certainly, we talk about that internally here, but we've got no published stated targets out there. I do think we
could withstand a better remix on the balance sheet. You know, that's been a goal of ours for quite some time is
to remix our balance sheet. And I think you're seeing the fruits of that labor with the strong commercial growth. So

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks Brendon. Maybe Brendon I'll start with you on slide 12. Great detail on the components and
the outlook. The one thing that sticks out is the static balance sheet assumption. Can you walk through, given you
guys have redeployed all the cash in the quarter? How the core margin would – the sensitivity of those metrics, if
you do get a dynamic balance sheet, maybe not the same level of growth, but a little bit of growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Chris, I think maybe the shorthand would be – we'd be near the higher end of that range with some
normalized [ph] sales (00:24:44) loan growth over the [indiscernible] (00:24:47) the remainder of the year. And
then better performance of deposit betas from these assumptions, maybe both through that top end range. But
that's probably shorthand.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe on costs, the $227 million that you lay out in the fourth quarter. That will assume all the
cost saves or like by the end of the quarter. I'm just trying to get a lift off point. It seems like 900-plus range exiting
the year. I'm just trying to get a sense for next year what level of cost inflation we should be baking in?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe if I can could sneak one in, you talked about the, I think, 17 new commercial and wealth
relationship managers. What about any attrition, given how competitive the markets are for talent today? Anything
unexpected today that you would call out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
I don't think so. We look at those attrition reports very regularly and our attrition has been running in a really close
to our three-year kind of average, just more broadly speaking, across the entire company. And certainly, we'll
have pockets here and there, but honestly, we've had really strong attrition numbers. But I do think we will
continue to recruit talent. And it's not – we're not replacing, always replacing positions, we are adding talent to
markets where we think we have the opportunity to continue to grow.
And we also have opportunities with our bigger balance sheet, right, and certainly some of the specialty
businesses that First Midwest brought to us to continue to grow and invest in those businesses. And so,
particularly, as we think about our more broader footprint, so we'll just continue to do that. But I don't see anything
in the attrition numbers. It's mainly kind of pause and in fact, as we've talked about historically, our relationship
managers in Chicagoland market has been excellent. We've had very little, if any, attrition in that market. So we
feel really good about our ability and having success helps, right. And I think we're showing a great deal of
success, particularly, in the legacy First Midwest footprint.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Great. Thanks. Thanks. And then maybe last one on the buyback, you talk about just rebuild near term.
What are the – I guess, the medium term thoughts on resuming that, obviously, I know loan growth is one
consideration.

You ran through some of the puts and takes to deposits in the second quarter. But it was nice to see balances flat
quarter-over-quarter given some of what your competitors have reported. Could you maybe talk about your
expectations for deposits in the second half of this year? And then given the conversion that occurred this month,
any noticeable change in deposit balances over the last month?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
First, I'll take this, I'll start. No noticeable change in deposit balances over the past month. Our expectations are
along this year that deposits will probably come under pressure as people deploy liquidity. That said, we are out
there and working on things to start growing deposits as we head into this liquidity cycle. And so, we're prepared
to defend what we have and proactively get on offense and start gathering deposits.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And another question for you, Brendon, again. Your outlook for fees, you kind of started your discussion with you
feel good about the momentum. But then as I look at some of the items, wealth, mortgage service charges, it
implied some pressure. So if you kind of normalize that other line and then think about the trends that are on slide
19, could you be a little more precise in your fee outlook?

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Terry, I think I got the gist of it, please, but let me know if I missed something. Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Definitely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
So, clearly, under pressure, I think we've had really strong organic growth in AUM and the wealth and brokerage.
But equity markets, the fixed income markets, obviously putting pressure and you're starting to see that come
through on the fee line. Obviously, the mortgage story is the same as everybody else's in the industry. But yes, so
that fee lines are moving under pressure but we feel really good about the organic growth in that space.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for that. And then one last question, you added on slide 9, your new loan production markets.
There was a new color versus last quarter. Could you just talk about where you've opened up some new LPOs
and what was behind that? Was it $73 million of production?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
Chief Executive Officer-Commercial Banking, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Hey, Terry. This is Jim Sandgren, so as we talked about – we've been in St. Louis now since 2019 and
have built out a nice team there. We've got a market president and two corporate RMs that are doing a great job.
We have a treasury management representative and a credit person there in St. Louis. And they've continued to
grow both on the corporate and commercial real estate side. We just recently got into Kansas City earlier this
year, really in January and hired two great middle market RMs, big bank background and they're up to a really
good start. So a combination of kind of middle market and CRE opportunities that have helped spur the growth in
those two markets.

Operator: Thanks for your question, Terry. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC.
Jon, your line is now open.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I was going to say, Jim, you're supposed to have the call drop on bad quarters, not good quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
This is the first that I've ever been here. We had three drops in a row. I don't know what's going on. It's raining like
cats and dogs out right now. So I don't know if the bad weather is causing us some technical issues here, but we
apologize.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
It's all right. Slide 12, just a couple of follow-ups. Brendon, what's – can you go into a little more detail about
overall goals of the hedging strategy? And are you giving anything up on the upside in pursuing this or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
No. We're trying to structure the hedging to allow us to take advantage of all the upside, but actually protects from
the downside. So that's why the collar structure and floor structure are in place. And the objective is to not be – to
act as an asset sensitive when the Fed funds hit the top, right. So it slowly manages to lean back to a neutral
position as we reach at the peak without making any big bets. So same thing, we did in the last recycle. We're
trying to do the same thing here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Chris McGratty asked about, under your assumptions of static balance sheet, I just wanted to go one more
further down. The 20% to 25% cumulative deposit beta by year end seems a little bit high since we're almost
already in August and you barely see anything budge. Just opportunity to outperform that type of assumption of
20% to 25% cumulative by the end of the year?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2022
Yeah. I think there's an opportunity. We're starting to see some pressure. That assumption was built off of looking
at the last rate cycle and where the Fed funds rate was. When it was at $250 million, where our deposit costs
were. But this is happening much faster. It's different. So we might have an opportunity to [indiscernible]
(00:34:35) pricing a little longer. It's definitely an opportunity to outperform.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. The couple more here. Slide 17 also appreciate all of the information here. But it's pretty draconian model
input for your reserve levels and I just I applaud you for that. But what's your thinking on provisioning and
reserves as a percentage of loans going forward from here? Because it already seems like you have some pretty
challenging economic scenarios built in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. We're going to continue to watch the economic forecasts and see where this might play out. We are putting
through a fairly pessimistic forecast, but we expected continued growth loans. We will continue to provision for
that and we will not – I don't believe in the near-term. We're going to be pulling back related to a more optimistic
forecast in the near-term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I just feel like this is the right approach for us in this economic environment. There's just so much
uncertainty out there. We're just going to continue to do the right thing and make sure we have plenty of reserves
and obviously provide for the great growth we expect to see for the rest of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. You kind of provided a segue into my last question, Jim. But obviously, there's a difference between
what we all read about and what we're seeing in your numbers and other bank numbers as well. So maybe the
segue is to integration. There's been some public stuff that the integration maybe didn't go as well as planned, but
it's pretty easy to cherry pick a challenging scenario and amplify it. So how do you think you did? And it sounded
like, in your earlier comments, you said it's starting to normalize again. So just give us an update on that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Sure. We feel like that, first of all, the data and systems conversion were incredibly well. I was in here on a
couple of Sundays ago, and we bounced out very early on Sunday morning. Our commercial clients adapted to
our new systems very well. There's just a lot of retail. We had 300,000 clients and there's just a lot of clients,
getting them to register their debit cards and getting them through their online and mobile channels. So we feel
really good about it overall. And certainly, again, it's easy to pick the handful of clients that maybe have said
something, but we continue to believe overall, we feel really pleased we're at and more importantly, it's largely
behind us in a rearview mirror going forward. So I don't know. Mark, what else would you add to that?

I think we're in a good spot with our clients in all of our business segments. As you said earlier, Jim, we had a
busy couple of weeks that we're on the back half of now. And so, I spent a lot of time in the last couple weeks
visiting with commercial clients and holding banking centers. And so you see the connection that our teams have
with their clients. I think we're in a really good spot in total.

Good morning, David.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
I wanted to ask about the little bit longer term on the net interest margin. Looking out to maybe 2023, I appreciate
the guidance that you gave for the next couple of quarters. But as you look to 2023, do you see some pressure on
an reported NIM at all as deposit betas pick up and maybe some of the purchase accounting accretion wanes a
bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. They will start to burn off accretion as we get into to 2023. But right now, we get Fed funds rate increases
that they're moving out beyond. So we'll continue to benefit from that. We're also re-pricing a big chunk of our loan
book at a much higher kind of medium-term yield. So I think we still have some room to grow that and expand that
margin into 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thanks, Brendon. And then on the M&A side of things, it sounds like across the industry talks are down
right now, but just curious how you guys are thinking about maybe into next year, do you have an appetite to bolt
something on or make another larger acquisition? Is there any appetite for that? Or how are you thinking about
sort of the next step in the M&A cycle for you guys?

James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Well, I would start with never say never, but we are incredibly focusing on continuing to integrate this partnership.
This was a transformational partnership and we feel really good about where we're at with the integration of the
clients and the team members, but there's still work to do and so we will continue to do that as a team. And if
opportunities come along, we'll definitely take a look at them. But we really need to be focused on the current
integration and growing organically first. And I do think things are very quiet out there. As you would imagine, I still
feel very close to what's going on in the world, and I think things are very quiet out there. But our first job is to take
care of our existing clients and grow organically. And if the timing is right and the opportunity is good enough, the
pricing is right, we'll definitely take a look.
