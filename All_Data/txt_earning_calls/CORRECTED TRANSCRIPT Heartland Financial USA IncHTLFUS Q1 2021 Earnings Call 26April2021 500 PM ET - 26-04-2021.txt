Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Elaine, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to HTLF's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call
under our new brand, HTLF. We appreciate everyone joining us today as we discuss the company's performance
for the first quarter of 2021. For the next few minutes, I'll touch on the highlights for the quarter. I'll then turn the

call over to Heartland's President and CEO, Bruce Lee, who will cover business performance and then Bryan
McKeag, our EVP and CFO, will provide additional color around HTLF results. Also joining us today is Nathan
Jones, EVP and Chief Credit Officer, who will be available to answer questions regarding credit.
Now, onto Heartland's financial highlights. And as you will see, we are off to a great start for 2021. We set a new
record for net income in the first quarter at $52.8 million and after our preferred dividend of $2 million, net income
available of common shareholders was $50.8 million compared to $20 million for the first quarter of 2020. Now,
that's an increase of $30.8 million or 153% increase. Diluted per common share of $1.20 compared to $0.54 for
the first quarter of last year, an increase of $0.66 a share or 122% increase. Annualized return on average
common equity and average tangible common equity was 10.49% and 15.9% respectively. Annualized return on
average assets was 1.19%, in line with our goal of 1% or greater. The net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent
basis was 3.48% for the quarter and our efficiency ratio was 56.61%, and our credit metrics continued to improve.
Bruce and Bryan will share more detail in their comments.
Well, book value in tangible book value per common share continued to increase, ending the quarter at $46.13
and $31.53 respectively. Now, that's a 9% increase for both from a year ago.
On the M&A front, in February, we had a very successful virtual systems conversion on our largest acquisition
ever, the AimBank transaction in West Texas, which was merged into Heartland's Lubbock, Texas-based
subsidiary, FirstBank & Trust, is now Heartland's largest bank with assets totally nearly $3 billion. Subsequent to
conversion, seven of the AimBank branches were transferred to Heartland's New Mexico Bank & Trust subsidiary.
As I said in the past, our priority has been to expand in our current footprint and work toward our goal of achieving
$1 billion in assets in each state where we operate. Currently, 9 of our 11 banks have assets exceeding $1 billion.
We continue to have a very deep pipeline of acquisition opportunities across our footprint with a number of active
opportunities currently in process. And as such, I anticipate acquired growth to be similar to what we experienced
last year. Also as part of our M&A process, we continue to explore and model branch sales as part of our branch
rationalization strategy. Well, at this month's meeting, Heartland's board of directors approved a $0.22 per
common share dividend payable May 31, 2021 to shareholders of record on May 17, 2021. The board also
approved a preferred dividend of $175 payable on July 15, 2021 to shareholders of record on June 30, 2021.
Now, our Annual Stockholder Meeting is scheduled for May 19, 2021 and that's at 1:00 PM Central Time and it
will once again be held virtually. We continue to add directors with unique skills and talents while at the same time
adding diversity to our board. I'm sad to report that this year we will lose two of our highly valued, long-term
Independent Directors, Mark Falb and Mike McCoy. I want to publicly thank both of them for their years of service
and for their guidance, counsel and dedicated support.
Now, that said, I'm pleased to report that we will be adding two new Independent Directors, [ph] Kathryn Graves
Unger (06:49) and Chris Hylen. You may recall that Chris joined the board just prior to year-end 2020. Both will be
standing for election as Class 1 Directors at this year's Annual Stockholder Meeting along with Susan Murphy,
Marty Schmitz and myself.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce Lee, HTLF's President and CEO, who will provide an overview of the company's
operating performance and credit. Bruce?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2021
Thank you, Lynn. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm proud to introduce
you to our new branding, HTLF. You're familiar with the letters HTLF as our stock ticker symbol. Now, those same
four letters are the brand name of our company. We refreshed our branding to better reflect our continued growth
and who we are today. Our tagline, strength, insight, growth are what we bring to our customers and what our
unique business model and diverse footprint brings to our shareholders as over 60% of our assets are now in the
west and southwest regions. Our banks are powered by HTLF technology, efficiency, and strength. It's community
banking with the scale to compete at any level.
The response to a scale up has been excellent. And we're excited about how the brand positions us with our
employees, customers, and investors. We're off to an excellent start in 2021. We had a very clean first quarter.
We delivered $1.20 earnings per share which will -- which we will build upon throughout the year.
Bryan McKeag, our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our outlook further in his comments. Total assets grew to
$18.2 billion, an increase of $336 million in the quarter. Assets are up $4.9 billion or 37% from a year ago. Pre-
provision net revenue was a record $67.5 million, an increase of 42% from a year ago and 2% from the linked
quarter. Our efficiency ratio was 56.61%, 521 basis points lower than a year ago. Our ability to drive efficiency
while strategically investing for growth and enriching the customer experience continues to differentiate us. And
our strong results delivered a record quarterly net income of $52.8 million, a 164% increase from a year ago and
33% increase from the linked quarter.
We delivered another solid quarter of deposit growth. Total deposits were $15.6 billion, an increase of $579
million from the linked quarter and $4.4 billion or 39% from a year ago. The growth was primarily in commercial.
Non-time deposits totaled $14.4 billion, an increase of $647 million or 5% during the quarter. We've maintained
our exceptional deposit mix. 40% of deposits are in non-interest-bearing accounts and 92% in non-time account
balances. Our disciplined deposit pricing [ph] reduced (10:40) total deposit costs to 12 basis points for the quarter,
a decrease of 2 basis points from the linked quarter and 41 basis points from a year ago.
Turning to loans including PPP, total loans increased $27 million, less than 1% from the linked quarter. Excluding
PPP, total loans were down $170 million or 2%. This breaks down as follows. Total commercial excluding PPP
decreased $74 million from the linked quarter. Commercial continues to be affected by decreased C&I line
utilization which was down $75 million in the quarter. Agriculture decreased seasonally $31 million from the linked
quarter, residential mortgage was down $53 million, and consumer loans decreased $12 million. We expect to
deliver commercial and agricultural loan growth in excess of $100 million next quarter.
The manufacturing, wholesale, distribution, and healthcare sectors are leading the way with strength at our banks
in Arizona, California, Colorado and Iowa. We're strategically adding talent to our commercial teams and taking
advantage of competitive disruption in certain markets. We're building momentum and our pipeline has grown
considerably in the last six months. We've introduced new consumer loan products and have a strong pipeline.
We expect to deliver $20 million in consumer loan growth in the second quarter. I've been back on the road
meeting with clients and bankers and I'm encouraged. Commercial clients are optimistic and looking ahead to
strong growth in the second half of the year. However, they're still experiencing some headwinds, rising raw
material costs, supply chain disruption and hiring and retaining skilled labor are common themes that could
impact the speed of economic recovery and growth.
HTLF is proud to have helped another 2,600 small businesses obtain loans totaling $429 million during the
second draw of PPP. Once again, our teams helped provide a critical lifeline in our communities. In addition to
PPP 2, we're supporting small businesses through our buy local program. Our banks are offering consumer loans

up to $5,000 at 0% interest for 36 months to help them make needed purchases and generate important business
growth within our communities. In 2021, we have funded more than 1,300 buy local loans of $6.4 million.
Turning to key credit metrics, we continue to see stable credit quality and remain cautiously optimistic about the
overall outlook. We are maintaining economic qualitative factors consistent with previous quarters until there's
more clarity about the pandemic and the economy. Therefore, we did not release any reserve this quarter. Our
nonperforming loans represented 91 basis points of total loans at the end of the first quarter, a slight increase of 3
basis points from the linked quarter but a decrease of 4 basis points from a year ago.
Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to 54 basis points compared to 64 basis points a
year ago. The delinquency ratio decreased to 16 basis points from 23 basis points in the linked quarter and
significantly lower than 38 basis points a year ago. Nonpass rated loans increased to 11.5% from 10.8% in the
linked quarter, primarily due to an increase in [ph] watch (15:18) loans while substandard loans decreased by $31
million or 6%.
Lastly, net loan charge-offs for the quarter were $1.5 million or 6 basis points of average loan, a slight increase of
5 basis points from the linked quarter and significantly lower than 24 basis points from a year ago. We continue to
invest in our growth through Operation Customer Compass, our multi-year strategic initiative. We're developing
products and implementing technology that will enhance the service we provide to our commercial and consumer
customers.
Later this year, we will begin delivering digital banking enhancements including expanded self-service
applications, document management tools, online appointment scheduling and customer service live chat option.
In February, we successfully converted systems for AimBank. We also transferred seven AimBank branches in
New Mexico Bank & Trust completing Heartland's largest acquisition to date. Commercial and consumer
customer retention has been stronger than expected. We're pleased with the operating performance of the
combined entity in the first quarter.
Our strategic acquisitions in growth markets have provided scale, added talent and brought new products and
services to acquired customers. We continue to have a deep pipeline of attractive prospects with a number of
active opportunities. In the first quarter, we consolidated nine branch locations, six were legacy branches and
three were recently acquired AimBank branches. We continue to rationalize our branch footprint to more
efficiently serve our customers. The health and safety of our employees and customers continues to be our top
priority. We are encouraged by the expanded rollout of vaccines in states within our footprint have loosened
restrictions. Across the country, we're opening more of our branches for full service. Bankers are meeting more
customers face-to-face and we're providing more options to deliver the high level of service customers expect
from our banks.
HTLF corporate employees will begin a gradual return to the office in May. As a company, we've learned how to
connect in many ways over the past year. As we return to working together in-person, we'll be even stronger than
before. I continue to be impressed by our employees, their ability to adapt, and their commitment to serving our
customers and communities. I'm grateful for their hard work and dedication that has strengthened our company.
We'll continue to adapt to local conditions but we're optimistic and well-positioned to serve our customers and
communities as they emerge from the pandemic.
I'll now turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, HTLF's Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our performance
and financials.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2021
Bryan R. McKeag
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thanks, Bruce. And good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin today with earnings per share which was reported at
$1.20 this quarter. The only significant item this quarter was acquisition and integration costs of $2.9 million or
$0.05 per share after-tax which related to the systems conversion integration of AimBank in February. So again,
this quarter, our core results were strong.
Before I go into my detailed comments, I would like to remind everybody that our updated first quarter investor
presentation is available in the IR section of our website. So I'll start my detailed comments today with the
provision for credit losses which totaled to $648,000 benefit this quarter and reflects the following components.
First, total loan balances excluding PPP declined to [ph] $170 million (19:49). Second, we continue to have some
loan downgrades that result in a small increase in reserves. Third, the consensus economic forecasts continue to
show some moderate improvement. However, the economic outlook factors and components used to develop the
allowance were left unchanged reflecting our assessment that the – there is still a significant level of economic
uncertainty. And last, net charge-offs were logged in this quarter just under $1.5 million or 6 basis points of
average total loans.
So at quarter end, the allowance for credit losses for loans was $160.2 million or 1.3% of total loans. And the
allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments was $14.6 million or 14 basis points of total loans.
Together, these two allowances result in a total allowance for lending-related credit losses of $144.8 million or
1.44% of total loans. When the PPP loan balances are excluded, the total allowance for lending-related credit
losses stands at 1.63% of loans compared to 1.62% last quarter. In addition, at quarter end, we had unamortized
purchase loan valuations on the balance sheet totaling $28.1 million or 32 basis points of total loans excluding
PPP.
Moving to the rest of the balance sheet, investments grew $239 million this quarter and comprised 36% of assets
with a tax equivalent yield of 2.28%, a duration of just under six years and generate $65 million to $70 million of
average monthly cash flow. Borrowings decreased $135 million to end the quarter at $490 million or 2.69% of
assets. The tangible common equity ratio declined 27 basis points to 7.54% at quarter end. Ratio declines of 34
basis points from the decrease in market value of investments and 15 basis points due to the larger balance sheet
were partially offset by a 22 basis point increase from retained earnings. Heartland's regulatory capital ratios also
remained strong with the common equity ratio or common equity Tier 1 ratio at just under 11.5% and the total risk-
based ratio at just over 15.3%. So the balance sheet continues to be very strong and well-positioned.
Moving to the income statement, net interest income totaled $139.6 million this quarter or $7 million higher than
the prior quarter. The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis this quarter was 3.48%, down 7 basis points
compared to last quarter as a 10-basis-point decline in investment yields and 4-basis-point decrease in loan
yields was partially offset by a 4-basis-point drop in interest costs.
The decrease in the margin was also impacted by $1.4 million reduction in fees recognized for PPP loan,
forgiveness and amortization which reduced the net interest margin by 3 basis points compared to last quarter.
We exited the quarter with just under $25 million of unamortized PPP loan fees remaining on our books. This
quarter, the net interest margin includes 12 basis points of purchase accounting accretion which is up 2 basis
points from the prior quarter. Noninterest income totaled $30.3 million for the quarter, down $2.3 million from last
quarter as all components of mortgage banking income combined were flat and security gains decreased $3
million compared to last quarter. In addition, service charges were $1 million higher this quarter primarily reflecting
a full quarter run rate from our new acquisitions.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2021
Shifting to noninterest expense, expenses remain well-managed, totaling $102.4 million for the quarter, up $3.2
million. Excluding noncore acquisition, integration, restructuring and tax credit costs as well as asset gains and
losses, our core expenses increased $6.7 million to $99.3 million compared to $92.6 million last quarter. This
increase reflects a full quarter run rate costs from our new acquisitions. So as we look ahead to the rest of 2021,
we believe HTLF will continue to deliver strong results highlighted by, first, our improving loan pipelines leading to
unexpected loan growth rate ex-PPP in 1% to 1.5% range next quarter with improving growth rates in the back
half of 2021 as the economy continues to strengthen.
Remaining round one PPP forgiveness will happen largely over the next two quarters and the new round of PPP,
which ended the quarter at [ph] $416 million (25:14) net of fees deferred, is expected to grow but is likely to stay
below $475 million. Our non-time deposit growth is expected to be modest next quarter and then flatten and could
even show some runoff in the back half of the year. Net interest margin will continue to see some modest
pressure, however, net interest income is expected to grow 1.5% to 2% per quarter going forward.
Provision for credit losses are expected to remain low and could be negative over the next quarter or two and
then return to more normal levels, as long growth picks up and the economy has stabilized. Non-interest income
excluding investment gains or losses in total is expected to increase by 5% next quarter to above $32 million then
flatten in Q3 and decline somewhat back to Q1 levels in the fourth quarter. Core expenses are expected to
increase just slightly into the $100 million to $101 million range in Q2, and then settle into the $100 million range
thereafter. We believe a 22% tax rates are reasonable full year run rate assuming no tax law changes. And lastly,
we expect the TCE ratio to climb back above 8.25% by the year-end as we get about 25 basis points increase
from retained earnings per quarter. However, higher long-term rates could continue to weigh on the ratio.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bruce for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And
our first question comes from the line of Jeff Rulis from D.A. Davidson.

Thank you. Good afternoon.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hey, Jeff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
So a lot to unpack there. I guess, Bryan, on the expense side, so that's -- maybe I'll just take a step back the
branch rationalization expectation for the – what you completed recently. But is there more on the horizon
[indiscernible] (27:45) continue in this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I think there might be one or two that's built into the numbers I talked about but not a lot more. We're continuing to
look at those, so I haven't put those in yet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So, Jeff, this is Bruce. So the last couple of quarters we've indicated that about 10% of our branches have
been under sort of review. And the vast majority of those changes occurred last quarter. So I would really just
echo what Bryan said, there's probably still a handful that we're looking at, but I would say it's we're going to get
some benefit but it's not going to be a material benefit going forward from any cost reductions associated with
branch closures.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. So if -- and with the conversion behind us and we have what I would assume a lot of the merger costs kind
of go away, that gets [ph] you like to that 100 (28:39). So, I mean, I suppose cost savings from there, it's more of
a – if we see efficiency improvement, it's more a revenue equation rather than net expense decline.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2021
Yeah. Yeah. I think it would hold – yeah, I think it'd hold expenses relatively flat. Like I say, they might go up just a
little bit this quarter only because we've got salary increases that go up. There are some things that cleaned up in
the first quarter and then you've got a little bit of the Aim efficiencies that will come in as we kind of get a full
quarter after our – after the conversion. So all those things kind of net to close to maybe a slight uptick and then it
should settle down and be really pretty flat going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And then last one is just to confirm the core margin, do you ever figure relative to maybe the $348 million
that excludes PPP and the accounting adjustments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think it's around $332 million, give or take 1 basis point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. How does that match with the fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I think that's down about 6 basis points. We were down...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
[indiscernible] (29:57) get there is we were down 7 basis points, negative 3 basis points from PPP but a positive 2
basis points. So I'm sorry the other way around it, positive 3 basis points and negative 2 basis points. It gets you
to right around that 6-basis-point range.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q

Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hey, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Bryan, maybe just a quick question for you and I appreciate all the forward-looking commentary. The net interest
income guide for the second quarter, how does that incorporate PPP either as the first quarter or out into the
second quarter? I just want to make sure I understand your outlook correctly there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I would say I'd put just a little bit of additional – since it was down this quarter and really forgiveness really
slowed down at the end of the first quarter, I think that number could be flat to up just a little bit kind of left the
amortization of P&A, purchase accounting the same. So really what it's about is the loan growth that Bruce talked
about and we probably won't grow the balance sheet to do that. We probably will just use cash flow off the
investment securities and use that to kind of increase the mix. So that will help the NIM and also we get an extra
day next quarter. So all that we'd put it in. I get to somewhere between 1.5% and 2% increase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Bryan.

Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Terry. [indiscernible] (31:42) Bryan said it was around PPP, we're going to see a pickup in the second quarter
because we didn't see as much as we were working on the originations of PPP queue in the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks for that, Bruce. And then just an M&A question, in the prepared remarks, it sounds like you'd love to
acquire a similar amount of assets in 2021 as you did in 2020. And after your experience with Aim and the
integration of a larger deal, would your preference be -- and I know you need to take what the market gives you,
would your preference be one larger transaction or are you really open to anything in order to build the scale that
you discussed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Terry, I've addressed this in the past and you know all things being equal which was never the case
obviously, but assuming that all things are equal, we would always take a larger transaction versus a smaller
transaction. And we would all always favor an end market acquisition versus the new market. And the current
deals that we have in the pipe that are active would be both in our Western markets and in our Midwest market.
So being in 12 states, we see an awful lot of deals. And so now, the balancing act is just to make sure you've got
the most accretive acquisitions that give us the best returns and [indiscernible] (33:05).

Operator: And the next question is from Andrew Liesch from Piper Sandler.

Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good afternoon, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Andrew.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just the securities book has increased the last several quarters and it sounds like you want to use cash flows off
and as well as the ongoing builds in Fed funds and other cash to fund loan growth. But how should we look at the
size of the securities book? Are you going to add more to it or do you think it's reached a peak and should decline
from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
It really depends on the inflows as much as anything, Andrew. But I would say we'd like to keep that about the
size maybe even down a little bit if deposits slow down and we can generate the loans and we can sort of shift
that asset from investment to loans that would be our – that would probably the perfect scenario. I think it's the
right thing to do to wait for rates to go up where we would start wanting to grow that portfolio at all. It's 36% of
assets. So it's pretty big for us. I think normal times, we'd love that to be more like 25%, between 20% and 25%.
So we've got a ways to go to kind of hold that down if we can.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And then I'm just curious like what securities were you [indiscernible] (34:36) the yields that were being
added in the first quarter was?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think we've probably been doing agency paper, trying to stay on the lower side in terms of duration. So
you're – we're talking low to mid-1s probably not some to get too excited about but it's better than zero. We're just
a couple of basis points [indiscernible] (35:01) cash so...

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2021
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Certainly. And still pretty sharp. Cool. You guys have covered all my other questions. Thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thanks, Andrew.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And the last question comes from Damon DelMonte from KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Hope everybody is doing well today. So most of my questions have been asked and
answered but just wanted to follow up on the margin. So, Bryan, I think with the 12 basis points or so of
accretable yield, that's somewhere like around $5 million. So should we be modeling in like $5 million per quarter
going forward for at least the next two or three quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I would think plus or minus that it's really hard to project. It really depends on how loans and I don't – I
always get surprised by that number which way it goes a few basis points. So I think kind of consistent would be
what I would do, Damon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then just through actually the core margin is expected to still kind of trend a little bit lower, right, for the
next couple of quarters, is that what you said before?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Like I say, it really depends on how well we can do on the loan growth if we can get the loan to replace
some of the investments, I think we can hold it flatter if that doesn't happen or if we get a lot more liquidity that we
can't put in the loans, it could come down a bit. It went down 6 basis points. I wouldn't think it would go down any
more than that but I would think it should try to be pretty flat.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then -- I'm sorry. You done? Oh, and then, Bruce, some of the commentary on the expected loan
growth. Can you just give a little bit more color on like what's giving you that confidence? Are you looking at your
loan pipelines and things are progressing pretty steadily and you expect these deals to be closing and hitting the
books like imminently? Is that kind of how you're feeling comfortable with some of that commercial and ag
expectations?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2021
Yeah. Damon, that's exactly it. When you look at closing dates and you look at -- I mean today, we're basically a
third of the way through the quarter and what is already closed gives me a lot of confidence in the numbers, [ph]
100 (37:22) of commercial and ag growth as well as we should have some consumer growth as well.

Damon DelMonte Q

Bruce K. Lee
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Elaine. In closing, HTLF had an excellent quarter. We delivered a record quarterly net income of
$52.8 million. Pre-provision net revenue was also a record, $67.5 million. Total assets grew to another record,
$18.2 billion. Total deposits, $15.6 billion. And our efficiency ratio was 56.61, a record low for the first quarter. And
we successfully converted systems for AimBank completing our largest acquisition to date. HTLF has momentum
and we're well-positioned for continued growth in the remainder of 2021 and beyond. I'd like to thank everyone for
joining us today. Our next quarterly earnings call will be in late July. Have a good evening.
