MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Northern Trust Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.
Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mark Bette, Director of
Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Mark M. Bette
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation's second quarter
2021 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call this morning are Mike O'Grady, our Chairman and CEO;
Jason Tyler, our Chief Financial Officer; Lauren Allnutt, our Controller; and Briar Rose from our Investor Relations
Team.
Our second quarter earnings press release and financial trends report are both available on our website at
northerntrust.com. Also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation which we will use
to guide today's conference call. This July 21 call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The only authorized
rebroadcast of this call is the replay that will be available on our website through August 18. Northern Trust
disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today.
Now, for our Safe Harbor statement. What we say during today's conference call may include forward-looking
statements which are Northern Trust's current estimates and expectations of future events or future results. Actual
results, of course, could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements because the
realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. I urge you to read
our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for
detailed information about factors that could affect actual results.
During today's question-and-answer session, please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-
up. This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask
questions as time permits.
Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady.

Michael G. O'Grady
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Mark. Let me join in welcoming everyone to our second quarter 2021 earnings call. During the second
quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our growth strategies across each of our businesses. In our
Wealth Management business, our goals driven approach and last year's launch of The Northern Trust Institute
continue to resonate with our clients, further increasing client satisfaction levels.
Our digital Navigate the Now campaign which we introduced last year is successfully generating new contacts
and leads, creating more opportunities. Uncertainty in tax law changes has also contributed to new business
momentum, and earlier in the quarter, we announced the launch of our Tax Policy Resource Center, an extension
of The Northern Trust Institute.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Within asset management, we continue to see momentum in our liquidity products as well as strong growth in our
FlexShares ETFs and ESG strategies. We continue to focus on expanding sustainable investment solutions and
earlier this month announced the launch of the Quality Low Volatility Low Carbon World Strategy, and actively
managed strategy focusing on high quality, low volatility stocks while maintaining a low carbon footprint relative to
the MSCI World Index.
We also introduced the Northern Trust ESG Vector Score which measures financially relevant ESG-related
criteria that could impact the operating performance of publicly traded companies. Within our asset servicing
business, we continue to see growth that was well diversified across regions, products, and client segments.
Recent notable public wins include Fundsmith, Marks & Spencer Pension Trust, Martin Currie Investment
Management, and Coal Pension Trustees Services Limited.
We continue to invest and expand our asset servicing solutions as evidenced by us finalizing our acquisition of
Parilux Investment Technology which underscores our commitment to the front office solutions business. The
execution of our growth strategies combined with favorable markets resulted in 12% year-over-year growth in our
trust fees despite significant headwinds from money market fee waivers. Our expense growth of 8% inclusive of a
pension settlement charge generated 4 points of positive fee operating leverage. The expense growth reflected
new business as well as investments in both technology and our staff as we continue to build a diverse, engaged
workforce with skills for the future.
I also want to draw your attention to our latest corporate social responsibility report, which we published last
week, marking a full decade of transparent, detailed, CSR reporting about the company. The report details our
progress towards creating long-term value for our clients, employees, shareholders, communities and other key
stakeholders.
Moving into the second half of 2021 and beyond, we remain focused on continuing to effectively navigate the
persistent low interest rate environment, focusing on driving greater efficiencies as well as continuing to grow
organically in a scalable and profitable manner. With respect to the public health environment, we continue to
operate in what we call resiliency mode which means we're focused on providing our clients continuity of service
while the majority of our employees worldwide are working remotely.
However, during the third quarter, we expect to see more of our staff returning to their respective locations. Our
return to office plans are being driven first by robust health and safety protocols specific to each location and,
second, by business function needs and timeline.
Finally, I want to express my sincere appreciation for our employees whose commitment, expertise, and
professionalism continues to be exceptional.
Now, let me turn the call to Jason to review our financial results in greater detail for the quarter.

Jason J. Tyler
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Mike. Let me join Mark and Mike in welcoming you to our second quarter 2021 earnings call. Let's
dive into the financial results for the quarter starting on page 2. This morning, we reported second quarter net
income of $368.1 million. Earnings per share were $1.72 and our return on common equity was 13.7%. This
quarter's results included a $17.6 million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits expense
category.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
As you can see on the bottom of page 2, equity markets performed well during the quarter. Recall that a
significant portion of our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels, and both the S&P 500 and
EAFE Local had strong sequential performance based on those calculation. As shown on this page, average one-
month and three-month LIBOR rates were stable during the quarter with only modest declines. US dollar was
weaker on a year-over-year basis which had a favorable impact on our reported revenue but it's unfavorable to
our expenses.
Let's move to page 3 and review our financial highlights of the second quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was up
5% with noninterest income up 10% and net interest income down 9%. Expenses increased 8% while net income
was up 18%. In a sequential comparison, revenue and expense were both flat while net income, taking our credit
provision and taxes into account, was down 2%. The provision for credit losses reflected a release of $27 million
in reserves in the current quarter compared to a provision of $66 million in the prior year and a release of $30
million in the prior quarter.
Return on average common equity was 13.7% through the quarter, up from 12.2% a year ago and consistent with
the prior quarter. Assets under custody and administration of $15.7 trillion grew 30% from a year ago and 6%
sequentially. Assets under custody of $12.2 trillion grew 32% from a year ago and 6% sequentially. Assets under
management were $1.5 trillion, up 22% from a year ago and 6% sequentially.
Now, let's look at results in greater detail starting with revenue on page 4. Trust, investment, and other servicing
fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled $1.1 billion and were up 12% from last year and
up 1% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $71 million in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year
and down 10% sequentially. The sequential decline was driven by lower client volumes as well as lower volatility.
The remaining components and noninterest income totaled $99 million in the quarter, down 3% from one year ago
and down 2% sequentially. Within this, securities commissions and trading income was flat with the prior year and
down 5% sequentially. The sequential performance was driven by lower trading within our core brokerage
business, partially offset by higher transition management revenue. Other operating income totaled $54 million
and was down 4% from one year ago and down 1% sequentially. Net interest income, which I'll discuss in more
detail later, was $344 million in the second quarter, down 9% from one year ago and down 1% sequentially.
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional
Services business, fees totaled $612 million and were up 8% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially.
Favorable currency translation benefited total C&IS fees on a year-over-year basis by approximately 3 points.
Custody and fund administration fees were $455 million and up 21% year-over-year and up 2% on a sequential
basis. Both the year-over-year and sequential increases were driven by favorable markets and new business with
a year-over-year comparison also benefiting from currency translation.
Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $14.8 trillion at quarter end, up 30% year-over-
year and up 6% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were driven by favorable markets
and new business with currency translation also a benefit in the year-over-year comparison. Investment
management fees in C&IS of $101 million were down 22% year-over-year and down 13% sequentially. Higher
money market fund fee waivers were the key driver of both declines, partially offset by favorable markets and new
business. Fee waivers in C&IS totaled $50 million in the second quarter compared to $28 million in the prior
quarter.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Assets under management for C&IS were $1.2 trillion, up 22% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. The
growth from the prior year was driven by favorable markets, client flows, and favorable currency translation. The
sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and net flows.
Securities lending fees were $19 million, down 29% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. The year-over-year
decline was primarily driven by lower spreads, partially offset by higher volumes while the sequential performance
was driven by higher spreads and volumes. Average collateral levels were up 19% year-over-year and up 3%
sequentially.
Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $464 million and
were up 17% compared to the prior year and up 5% from the prior quarter. Fee waivers in Wealth Management
totaled $29.2 million in the current quarter compared to $22.2 million in the prior quarter. Across the regions, both
the year-over-year and sequential growth were impacted by favorable markets and new business, partially offset
by higher fee waivers.
Within Global Family Office, the favorable impact of markets and new business were offset by higher fee waivers.
Assets under management for our Wealth Management clients were $371 billion at quarter end, up 22% year-
over-year and up 4% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets and client flows
while the sequential performance primarily reflected favorable markets.
Moving to page 6. Net interest income was $344 million in the quarter and was down 9% from the prior year.
Earning assets averaged $142 billion in the quarter, up 13% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $128
billion and were up 15% versus the prior year, while loan balances averaged $36 billion and were up 2%
compared to the prior year.
The net interest margin was 0.97% in the quarter and was down 25 basis points from a year ago. The net interest
margin decreased primarily due to lower average interest rates as well as mix shift within the balance sheet. On a
sequential quarter basis, net interest income declined 1%. Average earning assets and average deposits each
increased 1% on a sequential basis while average loan balances were up 6%. The net interest margin declined 3
basis points sequentially, primarily due to lower average rates.
Turning to page 7. Expenses were $1.1 billion in the second quarter and were 8% higher than the prior year and
flat with the prior quarter. The current quarter included a $17.6 million pension settlement charge within the
employee benefits category. This charge represented approximately 1.5 points of year-over-year and sequential
growth. The year-over-year comparison for expenses was also unfavorably impacted by currency translation by
approximately 2 points of growth. Compensation expense totaled $486 million and was up 6% compared to the
prior year and was down 6% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher cash-based
incentive accruals as well as higher salaries. The growth in salaries was primarily attributable to unfavorable
currency translation. The sequential decline was primarily due to the prior quarters' equity incentives including $32
million in expense associated with retirement eligible staff.
Excluding the previously mentioned pension settlement charge, employee benefits expense was up 11% from
one year ago and down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily relating to higher medical
expense while the sequential decline was due to lower payroll withholding partially offset by higher medical
expense.
Outside services expense was $218 million and was up 24% from a year ago and up 11% from the prior quarter.
Revenue and business volume expenses accounted for nearly two-thirds of the year-over-year growth and nearly

half of this sequential growth. The remaining growth within the category included higher technical services,
consulting and legal expense, reflecting investment in the business, as well as the timing of engagements.
Equipment and software expense of $178 million was up 9% from one year ago and up 1% sequentially. The
year-over-year growth reflected higher software support and amortization costs. Occupancy expense of $52
million were down 13% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially. The prior year included costs associated with our
workplace real estate strategies.
Other operating expense of $68 million was down 21% from one year ago and down 6% sequentially. The year-
over-year decline was driven by lower miscellaneous expenses including account servicing activities, mutual fund
co-administration costs, and supplemental compensation plan expense. The sequential decline was due to lower
miscellaneous expense partially offset by higher business promotion and staff related costs.
And turning to page 8, our capital ratios remain strong with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12% under the
standardized approach, flat with the prior quarter. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio is 7.1%, up slightly from 6.9% in the
prior quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased 252,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $30
million. We also declared cash dividends of $0.70 per share, totaling $148 million to common stockholders.
The current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquidity profile to
support our clients' needs and we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution
expertise they've come to expect from us. Our competitive positioning across each of our businesses, wealth
management, asset management, and asset servicing continues to resonate well in the marketplace.
So, thank you again for participating in Northern Trust second quarter earnings conference call today.
Mike, Mark, Lauren, and I would be happy to answer your questions. Stephanie, will you please open the line?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Morning, Alex.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, maybe I'll start with expenses and was hoping,
Jason, you could unpack some of the trends both on the comp and non-comp side of the equation. And I guess
on the comp side, when we look at the sequential decline in compensation, almost all of that was really just kind
of explained by the seasonal effects. So, comp was pretty well-controlled especially in the context of, I guess,
better revenue environment. So, how should we think about that for the rest of the year? Are there things that
would – is there enough for you guys to kind of hold the line on the expenses for the second half?
And then similarly on the non-comp side of things, things were, I guess, a little bit higher than originally expected
and you previewed that at a conference a few weeks ago. But similar line of question, kind of how should we think
about the jumping off points for the non-comp side of the equation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, let me take them in order. I think you hit the comp walking into this period well in that it was controlled.
You look at head count in particular, Alex, and that's flat for the second quarter in a row which evidences how
we've been managing through the announcements we made in January about what we were trying to do. And part
of that is that we also look to reinvest some of that savings which maybe plays into the second part of your
question which I'll come to in a second.
But in terms of thinking forward for the rest of the year, part of what we did was go through that expense savings
exercise, earlier in the year we talked about $40 million to $50 million somewhere in that range of savings. We've
gotten through that and executed that pretty well. At this point, not saying that we're going to continue to see a
downward trajectory. Now, I think frankly the business growth and some of the investments we're making in the
business might cause that to start to have more of a traditional feel going forward.
So, then if I come to the non-comp side and I think the area you're probably looking at, Alex, is probably outside
services. I mean we've got a – there's a $20 million increase sequentially there and we did talk about that. I did
reference that that line item was going to be higher than anticipated. And so, it probably make sense for me to
unpack that a little bit for the group. And the way we've been thinking about it is to separate that outside services
category, outside service line, two categories. First, there's a lot of business-related expenses that are that are in
there. And so, it's sub-custody, third-party advisory, brokerage clearing, market data, and those are line items that
are going to trend with the growth of the business. And about half of the growth that we see sequentially is related
to that business growth.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
And you can kind of even litmus test that. If that's half of the $20 million, you say it's about $10 million, compare
that to the fact that we saw about $40 million in trust fee growth ex-waivers. And so, that's not bad. And that's –
you should expect that when we've got that kind of lift on trust fees, you'd expect there to be some increase
coming in these business related growth exercises.
And then the second big category, there's a lot of our technology cost is within that outside services line. And
we've been – we've had a very consistent goal of strengthening the foundation of technology, improving data
architecture and our client experience. And since we're doing well on those head count exercises and markets are
up, we want to be deliberate and say we're going to reinvest some of that savings back into technology and that
accounts for about half of that increase.
Now, to your question on how should we think about it going forward? All that – that tech investments not going to
continue to grow at $10 million a quarter. The components of outside services that relate to technology should
actually be flat over the next few quarters. And we've got some of the engagements we had with consulting firms
and others kind of front load the activities there. And so, at this point, we're thinking that component should be flat.
The other component, sub-custody, third-party advisory brokering, that's going to continue to trend with the
business.
And in the hindsight I think even thinking back to the charges we talked about in January, that's a good example
of how we've deployed some of those savings in areas that we talked about to reinvest in technology broadly for
the business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. That's super helpful. Thanks for that. And then maybe I can squeeze another follow-up just around capital
return dynamics. The buyback was a little bit light this quarter. Obviously, you guys continue to have very strong
capital ratios and we've seen your peers talk about the willingness to sort of go even a little bit below their internal
set of management targets because the balance sheets have ballooned as much as they did. How does that
inform at all your appetite for share repurchases? I know you guys kind of think about yourselves relative to peers
in that sort of construct as opposed to the absolute sort of vacuum. But given the backdrop for share repurchases
for both [indiscernible] (00:23:49) curious how you're thinking about yourself.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. No. To acknowledge, a lot of firms have talked about aggressive share repurchase. To us, share
repurchase is tied to a lot of factors as we think about how to deploy earnings. And to keep capital level roughly
level, we've got to consider dividends which if you consider those kind of predictable, then you're managing the
two other factors: one, the capital required to support RWA growth; and then, lastly, share repurchase.
So, if you look at – we actually looked at the last five years pre-pandemic and dividends are interesting. They're
consistently about a third of net income. And so, think about the other two-thirds split between supporting RWA
growth and share repurchase, over that five years coming into the pandemic, RWA wasn't changing significantly.
So, the increase that we saw related to RWA growth is just about 15% and that leaves about 50% of our earnings
that were redeployed to share repurchase.
Since the start of the health crisis though, the relationship between repurchase and retention is actually flipped.
And so, dividends are still roughly a third, maybe a little higher. But the rise in loans, in securities that you see on
the balance sheet, that leads to an increase in RWA. So, about half the earnings have been redeployed in the

form of retention to maintain capital levels and that left about 15% for repurchase. That's kind of the narrative –
the overall lens of how we've gotten to where we are.
Now, that is not to say that we wouldn't change our capital levels or that the change in RWA is a long-term
phenomenon. We could easily see lower RWA levels in a lot of different scenarios that we could predict. But that
at least explains what happened in the five years pre-pandemic and the trends you saw there and then how things
have changed in the midst of the health crisis and how, at this point, our share repurchase are light relative to
what you saw coming pre-pandemic.

Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Hey, Glenn.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hello. Thanks. Hello there. Good morning. So, a question on just rate impacts, in general. Flat rates from here
were better, do we finally see the signs of NIM, NII, and fee waivers bottoming out or is there another level to
think about as non-operating deposits might start declining? Just curious to get your thoughts on the cadence
from here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. High level, I think the band at this point has narrowed a lot. And so, there's still run-off in the securities
portfolio. We're two-thirds of the way through the run-off there and we were still losing about 40 basis points. But if
we think about the impact of what that's doing, it's not as significant as it once was.
And then another component, people, obviously, you've seen IOER up. And I think one thing to note there, people
see we've got about $35 billion in cash, but we only have about $13 billion, $14 billion, $15 billion at the Fed. And
so, that translates to $1.5 million or $2 million a quarter, it's not that much in lift. LIBOR continues to be a big
impact and you actually saw LIBOR come down a little bit and went from, I think, 12 basis points to 10 basis
points over the quarter.
And so, all those things together, we're at least at this point we're not talking about $5 million and $10 million, and
$15 million moves. We're talking about $1 million, $2 million, $3 million moves a quarter and they're offsetting
each other largely. So, I think we're in a band where the volumes across the portfolio are going to be the driver of
what happens in net interest income.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. I appreciate that. I wonder if you could just expand or just comment on the fixed versus floating rate mix of
both your debt. And in the securities portfolio, I'm just curious if you're just thinking about locking in either side as
rates have moved yet again lower.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
No. It wouldn't cause us – the recent moves wouldn't cause us to make a change. We're constantly looking out on
the market and just thinking broadly about how we feel about it. And so, we did have duration step out a little bit. It
went from 2.5 to 2.6, and 2.6 maybe 2.7, somewhere in that range. But that's more reflective of the longer journey
we've been on extending the securities portfolio. But we're conscious to not try and chase return by doing
anything inconsistent with what we've talked about strategically. And the strategy we talk about at ALCO has been
to get about where we are right now in duration and in mix. And so, no significant changes that I would want to
forecast coming up.

Hi, Gerard.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Jason. Hi, guys. Can I follow up on the money market mutual fund waiver
fees? Now, that there has been a slight increase in rates in the reverse repo area where many in the money
market mutual funds are now engaged with the Federal Reserve, do you sense that your money market mutual
fund waiver fees could actually decline sequentially? Some of your peers have pointed that out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, I think they will. Unless we get a significant change in the short end of the yield curve, but what happened
mid-June was helpful for waivers. And if you think about – if you just think about the math of it – well, first of all, I'll
tell you – I can tell you where we were. We peaked at a run rate of $80 million to $85 million a quarter. And that's
where we were early June. And now as we sit today, the run rate is more like $70 million a quarter. And that run

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Now, that said, there's not much – I don't think there's that much more that's going to come in terms of run rate.
And I think at this point – because the money market mutual funds are so short and probably 40% of them, on
average, have 30 days or less in duration of portfolio. So, they've already turned over and reinvested. And so, the
run rate I gave you is largely reflective of the post IOER and overnight repo facility changes. But yes, there's a
benefit that came from that actions in mid-June.

Very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, you've talked a little bit about your reserves at the Fed. I think on
your balance sheet, your total deposits at banks – all central banks is around $54 billion, if that's the right number.
Can you tell me what's a more normal number? Once we get into maybe a more normal environment at some
point in the future, what would be the lower number that you'd be comfortable with?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, I'm not I'm not sure it's lower. Interestingly, we talk a lot about this, what is – if we layer in the overall
deposits, on average, deposits are – forget about just what's at the Fed but just in general, what's driving the
asset levels is the liability side. And if we're at $125 billion, $130 billion, is that a post pandemic normal? And it's
just too hard to tell. And I think there's – clients are right now, they've held on to liquidity longer than what we
would have anticipated. And that 35 – the $15 billion, the other $20 billion-ish that's in – $20 billion, $30 billion
that's in other currencies and other central banks, it's all driven by the deposit base. And it's held in there pretty
flat for a while now on that $120 billion, $130 billion level.

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jason, curious about the loan growth. So, that was pretty robust
this quarter and actually the end of period, higher than the average. So, certainly suggest it was steady through
the quarter. Can you maybe give some color around what's driving the loan growth? And also the decline in the
loan yield, was that simply a function of LIBOR or was there some mix that was contributing to that as well?
Thanks.

Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, the loan growth, I'm going to – I'd put it in two buckets. One is there has been an ongoing for the last several
months, for this year and maybe even leading up to it, an initiative, a desire, a deliberate level of activity with
clients to explain to them, we like the types of loans that we do but we're willing to do more of them with those
clients.
And I've talked about being perceived as more of a reluctant lender. And so, we've been talking to clients saying
we'll do more. And so, that has been a continued lift to our loan portfolio. I think particularly relative to what we've
seen in the rest of the industry. That said, there's also a chunk of it that's more – that's probably more episodic.
And we've talked about the spikiness and the deposits that can come from particularly GFO clients who are very
large asset owners.
And there's an element that's there that we would view as episodic and spiky and that's leading to both the – a big
part of the increase that you mentioned and also is a driver of the yield. But back to the fact that we did see
LIBOR come down a couple basis points that obviously is also going to have an impact on the loan portfolio as a
whole.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then thinking about organic growth in the quarter, you guys had signaled
recently that things were starting to pick back up after being on hold with the pandemic and of the disruption. So,
how did organic growth come in this quarter? And when you think about organic growth particularly on the wealth
management side, do you all typically use metrics that are consistent for wealth management like net new assets
in order to gauge that growth? And is there any chance that we'll be getting some disclosure, maybe some formal
disclosure around those metrics at any point so we can have a better, more clear sense of how this business is
growing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, the – feel like we're revenue numbers by region and also splitting out the family office business. And so, we
can come back to the disclosure element if you'd like, but just maybe start sequentially with your questions. The
organic growth across the company was good and it was strong in C&IS for the quarter. We look at that very
much year-over-year. It's very difficult to try and unpack that on a sequential basis. But the C&IS business has
had strong new business growth and that's coming to fruition. It's being on-boarded and we're seeing good
organic lift in the business.
And then wealth, as you can see, is benefiting a lot. It's more exposed to market growth, and so that has been
more of a help. But there has also been good year-over-year growth in the Wealth Management business as well.
I'll also call out in looking at the numbers a little bit deeper that a portion of the growth sequentially in wealth came
from what we think of as some nonrecurring items. We have those items in C&IS and we call those out, but we
also have those in the Wealth Management business. And so, that can be trust and estate settlements, it can be
how we account for alternatives coming onto the income statement. Not a huge amount but call it $3 million, $4
million of the lift that we had nonrecurring in nature. But overall, it was a good – it's a very strong organic growth
quarter for the enterprise.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Mike, your opening comment, you mentioned the digital strategy and some changes that you made and how
that's helping out right now. That's a very high level comment and it's appreciated. But can you connect that to
some more concrete metrics on how it's actually impacting the results that we're seeing and maybe will impact the
results ahead?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, I think with digital, Mike, there's a number of ways to look at it. But to start with the reference in my opening
comments there particularly in Wealth Management, a lot of this is, as I've talked previously, about switching from
a new business generation model that has historically been, primarily, I'll call it either in-person or on-the-phone, if
you will, to be more digital. And so, when I talked about the Navigate the Now campaign, that was essentially or
driven by an online digital campaign. And the key to it was that how do we generate more opportunities from that,
so, leads from that. And so, both with what was online, it was supported then with some more traditional media
through advertisements. That generated thousands of leads for us at a high level, which then have been worked
through to get to the leads that fit our profile and then could be followed up, I'll call it, in a more traditional way in
doing that.
The other one I'll mention, Mike, that I referred to is the Tax Policy Resource Center, which is part of the Northern
Trust Institute. And while we talk a lot about that is our knowledge base that we leverage for our clients, but it's
also a significant new business generation asset. And the reason why that's also digital, specifically to your point,
is when we launched that center which essentially is online then that has generated significant new leads. So, just
with that policy resource center, since it has been launched we've had over 250,000 views of that. And then from
that, that gives us the data, if you will, to then follow up with those that are going to the center. And again, that
doesn't mean that 250,000 of them will be "good leads" but it's the funnel which you then work those through
down to ultimately being new clients. So, when I mentioned digital, that was the reference on that front.
And then to your point, more broadly with what we're doing just with digitalizing our entire business, that's much
broader with regard to our technological capabilities that drive both new capabilities for clients but also efficiencies
for our business model.

And on that last point, when you talk about efficiencies for the business model, is there any way you can size the
potential, your aspirational targets, lowering unit costs, improving the fees with expense relationship? Any kind of
context you can put around that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, as you know and you highlighted it there, there's a number of financial metrics but one that we've
looked to which is the expenses, the trust fees and we've continued to drive that down over time. And I do think at
a high level financial perspective, that's where you're going to see it come through. And just to try to make that
more tangible, so, one of our big investments in asset servicing is in our matrix platform. That first is focused on
transfer agency. And so, with it, yes it will provide a much better experience for our clients' clients, right, because
we're doing that on behalf of asset manager clients but also that is going to yield significant efficiencies for us.
Essentially, that's the first, I'll call it, funding mechanism for the business plan to make that investment. And then,
the other of course is generating new business because of the capabilities.

[audio gap] (00:42:27) with regards to the outlook, Jason, I was hoping you could speak to what's driving just
some of the increased loan appetite in the current environment. I know you talked about really strong growth in
demand across our client base. But I was hoping you could provide just some context around how much was
seasonality a factor that maybe drove this step-up given some of the tax seasonality. And just the implications for
the NII trajectory in the back half whether there's a sufficient offset to the securities yield headwind that you had
cited earlier in your remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Not a lot – there's not a lot of seasonality on the loan side for us at all. Some on deposits but not on the loans.
And so, what I was talking about earlier is there may be a layer there that's less about seasonality but more about

just the spikiness of how some of our very, very large clients will sometimes come to us and say, we want to
borrow very large dollar amount to either avoid selling a large asset, avoid the public sale of large assets, and
we're happy. Those are extremely high-quality loans and they're meaningful to clients to help on their liquidity
needs.
But you can also imagine pricing on them isn't something that's driving incredible increase in NII either. And so, I
don't think that – I think it probably sticks out more in volume levels than it will in NII levels over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. And just for my follow-up also on NII. I was hoping to get a sense as to how you're thinking about managing
some of the excess liquidity that's parked at the Fed, you saw a very healthy step-up not surprisingly sequentially.
And the securities growth has been relatively tepid as excess reserves have continued to expand. I want to get a
sense as to whether you have sufficient excess liquidity or buffer some of those incremental funds back into
securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. We've got a lot of – we've got plenty of room right now if we wanted to move from whether it's HQLA or
non-HQLA, whether we wanted to increase the balance sheet size of clients, we're the driver there and saying we
wanted to do significant increases. Again, we haven't – we're not incredibly receptive to the phone calls from
organizations we don't work with, saying can we park $10 billion to $5 billion on the balance sheet. We've always
talked about the balance sheet being there for our clients and being a strategic resource for us engaging with our
clients. But at this point, we feel like we've got a lot of flexibility. I think you look at Tier 1 leverage of 7.1% and
that gives an indication in and of itself of tens of billions of dollars of room that we could have to bring on
additional assets. And then, in terms of how we would deploy it, there's also plenty of room we have to move
between HQLA and non-HQLA based on what we see as attractive in the market and the risk profile that we're
looking at across the different asset classes that we invest in.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I had a couple questions on some of the initiatives that you've announced recently, in particular, the European
ETF launch and the Alternative Asset Servicing Digitization Initiative. Maybe you could give us a sense as to how
we should be thinking about the rollout, the timing, the impact? Is it likely to come through earnings in the next
couple of years or is this client acquisition over time type of initiative?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I'd headline both is long-term strategically important, but short-term not needle-moving from the income statement
perspective. And take for example the European ETF, just we've got $160 billion in AUM in overall assets, mostly
in Europe related to ESG. And we've got a nice business in Europe when it comes to dealing with ESG and fund
launches. And so, that's a good example of us thinking about what's important for our clients and working with the
asset management business to determine what they can do to provide incremental resources for clients long-
term. You think about the size of $1.5 trillion in assets and AUM in the asset management business and that's not
something that we think is going to be a needle mover to that $1.5 trillion but also strategically really important.
I don't know, Mike, if you have anything you want to add.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
And, Betsy, to address the other one, it fits into my comments on digitalization and the fact that the first driver
often is the efficiencies that we get from it. So, what we announced there on the alternative asset side is the ability
to use machine learning in order to essentially capture all the data for alternative assets and digitize them if you
will so that then they can be much more efficiently processed through the entire process. And so, something that
will benefit us on the efficiency and productivity side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then just separately, obviously, equity markets are up nicely. We're hearing about a lot of pension
plans that are looking to get frozen and put into the hands of OCIO providers. I know you're involved in that
business. Could you give us a sense as to how you believe you're positioned for what seems like is a wave of
opportunity here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Yeah, you're right, I mean we're in that business and in a good way and we – if you think about particularly
North America pension plans, our OCIO business is – and I'm a little [indiscernible] (00:49:10) on the numbers but
it was, at one point within the last few years we were the leader in that space. And so, it falls into our sweet spot
well. We've got very good expertise, very sophisticated client base particularly on the DB side of the OCIO
market.
Now, the flipside to it is you get a lot of clients who, as they de-risk and do other things with their portfolios, that
can sometimes work against you. And so, I don't think about it as a big wave that again is going to move the
needle on $4 billion in fees, but that's a very strategically important business for us where we've done extremely
well over time with high quality clients and a very talented team. And so, when there's money in motion there for
firms to be thinking about outsourcing their DB plans, I think we're very well-positioned.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. I would just add, Betsy, because we do believe we're particularly well-positioned for that trend because in
addition to what Jason said, if you think about our business model, you have the OCIO practice that Jason talked
about but also we have relationships through Wealth Management and through the Family Office part of that as
well where we have exposure and connections into a number of foundations. That might not be as large as some
of the biggest that you read about but are going through the same decision making of whether they want to just
outsource the investment activity there. And we think that will continue and we think again we cover it, I would say
as broadly as anybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. All right. Thanks. And then just one squeeze-in question on the dividend. I know we talked earlier about the
buyback, but should we be expecting any changes to the dividend going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, if you look over the last few years, particularly pre-2020 was just kind of goofy year, but our dividend is
pretty consistently 30% to 50% of net income and it's been very consistent. And if you look at where this quarter
falls, it falls right in the middle of that 30% to 50% range. And so, nothing there that would raise a flag up or down.
We think it's very attractive.
And we also, interestingly, I think something people don't do a lot, we look at dividends relative to RWA, which is
an interesting way to combine thinking about payout ratio with returns. So, as we look at our peers and you can
pick your own but both in terms of that – the level of that payout ratio on a percent basis relative to earnings, the
consistency of it and also how it is relative to RWA which again gets to both returns and payout, relative to the
peers that we look at, we scored really well on those different lenses.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Hi. Good morning. Just a follow up on that point on capital further. I just want to make sure I'm clear that it seems
like you're focusing as much on just maintaining capital ratios with that balancing act you mentioned on RWA
versus the combined shareholder return. So, I know you guys don't give us formal targets but I think historically, I
might have thought you might have lived relative to where the others are. Is this a little bit of difference? Maybe
it's post-pandemic or maybe it's a – you want to keep some aside for inorganic opportunities. Just wondering like
just how we think about how Northern Trust thinks about your absolute capital in that regard. I understand the mix
of usage has changed but coming back to just like where you want to live on absolute levels? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. And Ken, it's Mike. I think you hit on the key factors and how those do change over time. So, to your point
you said, well, the pandemic and how you may feel about, that criteria is the operating environment. So, we're
always looking at that operating environment, determining where we think we need to be.
The second I would say is certainly from a regulatory perspective. And again, we feel very good about where we
are there but that's another lens to make sure that we think we're in the right place vis-à-vis all the ratios and the
whole CCAR process and everything. And then third, as you mentioned [indiscernible] (00:53:59) absolute, it's the
relative capital ratios which we know that, that is a part of the considerations that clients have when they think
about a financial partner. A partner that they need to trust not just today to be around and be strong but be around
for a very, very long time.
I mean that's part of the pitch if you will, Ken, is that Northern Trust has been around and will be around through
all types of environments. And that we have, amongst all, the capabilities but we also have the financial strength
and capitalization. So, that's why that criteria is important. And to your point, that can change over time as our
peers move their capital levels up and down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Right. Okay. It's just would seem to me that you got plenty of capacity on all of those factors plus room for
balance sheet growth plus room for buybacks but it just seems like the mix of the buyback has become a smaller
proportion obviously as we saw this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. It did. But as Jason went through, we've just gone through in the last six quarters a meaningful increase in
RWA. Largely intentional, if you will, as Jason talked about where we saw that opportunity to really support clients
and to get prospects that would not just be credit clients, but broader relationships. And so, we saw that as a
better opportunity at that time to redeploy in the business and RWA went up, as he said, more in the six quarters
than it did in the five previous years in a meaningful way. Does that stay the same going forward? Obviously, we
don't know. But generally speaking, these things tend to change over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Very fair. Thank you, Mike. And just one question on deposit growth which has remained stickier as you guys
have mentioned. Are you comfortable housing it all on balance sheet even though you're getting relatively low
returns in the low rate environment or do you contemplate trying to move some of it off into off-balance sheet
vehicles?

We can start in that instance with what's best for clients. And we've got $280 billion in money market fund family
and the performance there is good. It's a very attractive set of money market mutual funds. At the same time,
some clients really like the – saying we want to be on the balance sheet. And some of it is geographic. Obviously,
in the US, there's much more prevalence to use funds where some of our European clients like to use the balance
sheet more. I think we're in a good position where we've got room on both sides, leally good attractive offerings
on both sides. Don't need to nudge clients one way or another for us.
That said, we sometimes look in different operating environments. We can about pricing. We can think about the
value proposition that we can offer clients in one platform versus another. And we can have conversations with
them about that and do things but not in a position at this point to have to nudge. Again, that's 7.1% in this
environment where all bank balance sheets are inflated, it gives us a lot of room to be able to just lead with what
makes the most sense for large sophisticated depositors.

...come back into the capital question since the buybacks and dividends have caught everybody's attention.
Following up on your comment that you do, do it with versus you watch versus peers and that you're focused on
the risk-weighted assets. So, that would imply that you're focused on the CET1 ratio versus peers. Is it a gap?
What is the gap that you're trying to maintain above peers? Is it 100 basis points? Is it 50 basis points? Can you
give us some sense of sort of as we think about how do – in the constructs of your balance sheet, whatever
assumptions we make, what is it that we should be keeping in mind?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Yeah. There's no gap in particular and that's not even – I also wouldn't say that's the only ratio that we look,
CET1. We're looking at – we've talked about Tier 1 leverage a few times just this morning on this call and there
are other things that we look at as well in terms of the balance sheet strength and what are – credit quality and
other factors and how all that duration and what exposure is like to interest rate risk. And so, there's a lot of ways
to litmus test that.
And then at the same time, we've also mentioned and Mike just walked through the framework a few minutes ago,
we're thinking not just about the relative but at an absolute level where we want to be and thinking about what the
regulatory environment is like. And then, I always remind people that we're not just making this decision
unilaterally internally. We have really good engaged conversations with our board around this topic as well on
where we might want to be – where we might want to take the balance sheet strategically.
And so, I know it's tempting to kind of look and say, okay, well what's the floor and where are you going, but
there's so many factors that we're looking at. And also, what's the reinvestment opportunity set look like. And if
we've got opportunities to let RWA grow in ways that we think are building the future earnings and that's what I
think some people can miss is that the RWA growth isn't just a drag. That theoretically should give you – should
give a sense that there's potential future earnings that's expected. And we're still – we're trying to grow earnings.
And so, looking at dividends and share repurchase I think can sometimes take it – pull that narrative toward
thinking about those things is the better way to redeploy earnings. But the RWA growth is reflective in some ways
over the long run of the base of business that we have.
Now, again, it's not to say that we think RWA is going to continue to increase. It could come down. Even
mentioning the loan growth we've talked about is something that had a significant increase in RWA this period. If
that goes away in a year, then the RWA would come down. And so, there's so many factors that when we sit
around the table and talk about where do we want to go with redeployment of earnings, we've got to try and
predict not just where things are but where things are going at each of these elements. But it's certainly broader
than thinking about a specific gap on CET1.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. Great. And one more on – as you look at your overall expenses, you've told us that the other
operating expenses, what do you expect the trajectory to be. Are you seeing any other impact from an inflationary
standpoint? Any color on that given the big talk in the environment about inflation. What are you able to do to
offset that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I think we missed the operative word there. Are we looking to see any changes and what did you say to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
From the rise in inflation. Are you seeing any inflation increase impacting your expenses, Jason? And if so, how
you – either what are you do – being able to do to offset that?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Thanks for clarifying and then just another component of the question. The comments we made earlier weren't on
other expenses, it was on outside services just to make sure everybody understands what we were talking about
in detail there. But the inflation is showing up in different areas. I mean every firm is dealing with talent issues and
the pressure is there. We certainly see that and experience it and talking at management levels about how to
address it. And the inflation we see across the business and different areas as well. And some of it is unit costs
but some of it is just the increased cost of doing business. And we talked about the significant increase in
technology oriented expenses that we're having. In some ways that's an inflation cost on the business. It's not just
a unit price inflation but it's inflation in the overall cost of doing business. So, it's showing up in different ways
across the organization.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah .I would just add, Vivek, if you think about it in a manufacturing context, to Jason's point, we're seeing
inflation on the cost side in a number of ways. In the manufacturing context, your question will be, are you able to
pass that on to the end consumer and that's not the way our operating model is set up. That said, if you think
about, generally, how we're pricing what we do, a lot of it relates to the asset level. So, to the extent that that
inflation is going through to AUM, AUC levels, you're capturing some of it there. And then, also to the extent that
you believe that there's inflation on the horizon as well, you would expect the interest rates to go up as well. And
we know where we are on rates and what the impact would be to the extent that those increase.

Brian Bedell Q

Michael G. O'Grady A

Good morning, Brian.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but maybe just to come back on the
seasonal expenses in the second half. You gave us the color on the outside service expense. Typically, you see a
seasonal bump in equipment and software expense. That has been pretty reliable at least over last three years.
So, if you could just maybe comment on whether we expect to see that similar dynamic. And then, in other
expenses, just I don't know if I missed it, but the Northern Trust Open is that – is going to be a factor for 3Q.

Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thanks for bringing up the equipment and software price, I should have referenced that earlier. Yeah, there would
likely be an increase there as we think about what's happening over the remainder of the year. And it's not one or
two areas that I could point you to but it's just – you're right, there are some dynamics where that tends to tick up
some of the expenses that we – some of the capital expenses that we put in place, you start to see depreciation
come up there. And it's in a lot of different line items but there should be a tick up there, a normal-ish or maybe
even slightly above that increase in equipment software. And then in terms of golf, I don't know, Mike, do you
want to take that, if you want?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
It will be in their third quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. And Brian, this is Mark. I mean you could look at the business promotional line even though that's not all
the golf but there's seasonality to it. And if you looked at it 2017 through 2019, there was about a $16 million to
$17 million step-up from second to third quarter so that's probably a decent way to think about it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. That's helpful.

Yeah, go ahead.

Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Last year as we came in, we were wondering whether because of the pandemic, those numbers would be lower.
And I think everybody should be thinking about it as more of a normal year. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
The numbers are marked throughout it. It will be the one thing that's important for people to take away.

Jason J. Tyler A

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Right. Right. Okay. Yeah, really makes sense. And then maybe just on ESG, just back to that. Two-part question.
You mentioned – I think, Mike, you mentioned that the ESG Vector Score that you launched, I think that's for
asset owners if I'm not mistaken. I guess the question there is that something that you are charging for separately
or more built into the overall service offering? And then on the wealth side, are you seeing demand from your
wealth clients, increasingly to invest in investment with social responsibility and are you meeting that through your
own investment management or other open architecture managers on the platform?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, yes, we are seeing the demand, Brian, kind of across the fronts that you talked about. So, let me just give a
little more detail to it. First of all, with our asset servicing clients, to your point, as they invest more in ESG, they
need the analytics and data and reporting to support that. And so, we are providing that type of service to them.
And one of the examples that I mentioned earlier, the Marks & Spencer mandate that we had in the quarter was
for that service, just as an example.
And then with Wealth Management, absolutely, our client base is interested in ESG and increasing their
investable assets in that area. And as much as we have an open architecture model with Wealth Management,
much of it is serviced through NTAM. And so, we've seen the benefit of that in NTAM. And NTAM on its own or in
addition on the institutional side is seeing that demand and fulfilling it as well. And so, just to put some numbers
on that, our ESG assets in NTAM now are at about $155 billion which is up over 50% from a year ago. So,
healthy growth in that area and it's an area of focus for us as a company.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. That's great color. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure, thanks.
