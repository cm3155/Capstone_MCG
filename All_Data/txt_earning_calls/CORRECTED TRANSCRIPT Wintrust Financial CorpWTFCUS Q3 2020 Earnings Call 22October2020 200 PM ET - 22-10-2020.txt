Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Thank you very much. Welcome everybody to our third quarter earnings call. With me, as always, are Dave
Dykstra, our Chief Operating Officer; Dave Stoehr, CFO; Kate Boege, our General Counsel; Tim Crane,
President; and Rich Murphy, our credit guru.
We have the same format as usual. I'm going to give some general comments regarding the results. I'm going to
turn it over to Dave for more detailed analysis of other income, other expenses and taxes. Back to me for a
summary and then time for questions. So, first of all, 2020 continues to be full of surprises and unpredictable, if it
weren't for CECL, COVID and their effects on interest rates, I think we'd have experienced pretty much a
gangbuster year.
In that regard, though, it's nice to record earnings again. Earnings were $107 million for the period or $1.67 a
share. Year-to-date earnings were $191 million or $3.06 a share. Pre-tax, pre-provision, pre-MSR, $165 million
compared to $173 million in Q2. The net interest margin was down 17 basis points. I'll go through that. ROA of
0.99%, ROTE of 13.43%, our net overhead ratio at 87 basis points, so pretty good on all fronts from that regard.
Net interest income in the margin first, net interest income was down approximately $7 million, primarily due to the
reduction of PPP fee recognition of $8 million, resulting in slower-than-expected forgiveness estimates, and the
[ph] bank's elevated (00:03:10) liquidity numbers.
[indiscernible] (00:03:12) PPP amortization the first part of 2021, the latter part will be the liquidity issue, be
discussed in a second. The NIM decreased 17 basis points to 2.57%. Earning asset yields decreases of 18 basis
points were offset by a 19-basis-point increase in – decrease, I'm sorry, in paying liabilities.
Free funds contribution decreased by 4 basis points due to the lower cost of funds. The remainder of the
decrease relates to the aforementioned [indiscernible] (00:03:44) PPP fee accrual. That was 14 basis points. The
yield around 3.85% is our current number for PPP yields going forward.
If you look at this in terms of the margin without PPP that's taking out the PPP money interest income and fees
less our cost of funds, our core net interest margins was relatively constant at $237 million. We believe that we
can build off of this going forward. I think this is the low point. We think that through investing and liquidity our loan
demand [indiscernible] (00:04:29) 10 to 25 basis points gets you back to the 2.7% to 2.75% we said we would
bottom out at.
We're currently carrying over $3.8 billion [indiscernible] (00:04:42) money in negligible yields. The overall duration
of our entire liquidity management portfolio is 1.44 years down [indiscernible] (00:04:50) in Q2 and 4.2 years at
the previous year end. As a reference point, we usually try to keep it at 4 to 5 year range. Redeploying these
assets and the loans and other earnings assets and shrinking our deposit base by reducing institutional funding
[indiscernible] (00:05:06) to support PPP loans [indiscernible] (00:05:08) extend 10 to 25 basis points over time.
As I said it brings us back in line with the 2.75 margin plus or minus we've previously [indiscernible] (00:05:17)
number. It's a very fluid situation in times like this you can imagine the optimization to take a few quarters
dependent on actual PPP run off etcetera. A little bit more on this later.
Credit quality based on conventional metrics is remarkably good. You wouldn't think that there was a pandemic
going on. NPLs decreased by $15 million over Q2 to $173 million or 54 basis points compared to 60 basis points
at the end of Q2. NPAs decreased $16 million to $182 million or 42 basis points as compared to 46 basis points
the end of Q2.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
COVID modifications fell to $413 million, $1.7 billion at June 30, representing 1.4% of total loans net of PPP
loans. Charge-offs net in the quarter totaled $9.3 million or 12 basis points. The charge-offs include $6.4 million
[indiscernible] (00:06:16) on individual loans which were in place at 6/30. Provision for the quarter totaled $25
million as compared to $135 million in Q2 [indiscernible] (00:06:28) to the portfolio growth, the portfolio ratings
remain relatively constant with prior quarters. Details of ratings migration are included in the earnings release
slide deck.
The allowance [ph] for outstandings is (00:06:41) $389 million or 1.35% of loans excluding PPP loans. Core ratio
that is loans net of premium finance loans and PPP loans is at 1.88%. Hard to believe that credit is as good given
the environment, be assured we're not going to let our guard down here. We're not naive enough to think that
there will not be bumps in the road going forward. But, in any case, we're actually reserved right now.
On the one-timer front for the quarter, negative one-timers include $3.1 million to settle a mortgage banking
dispute related to 2008, believe it or not, $6.3 million of a contingent consideration related to a previous
acquisition of – and $132 million of acquisition expenses. $6.3 million of additional consideration that we believe,
will cover the fourth quarter. In the next year, the numbers get negligible in terms of the amount we would owe
under that. So we think we've got it covered now. But we need more [indiscernible] (00:07:40) the mortgage
business is still on fire.
We also recorded $3 million decrease in MSR valuations due to continuing falling mortgage rates. We now have
close to $10 billion of service – the MSR service portfolio, so any rise in rates is certainly going to be the beach
ball underwater. And [indiscernible] (00:08:03) we also recorded a $9 million pre-tax settlement of an uncertain
state tax position. So other than the $3 million of MSR valuation, one-timer was basically washed.
So a quick on other income, other expense Dave is going to cover in detail but a couple of general comments. As
you know, although the mortgage business was extremely strong, it appears this trend will continue at least for
another quarter based on pipelines and hopefully longer, always dependent on interest rates. So the mortgage
business is an integral part of our overall strategy. When rates go down, the mortgage business kicks in and helps
while we readjust the balance sheet to optimize earnings in that regard. We retain a positive GAAP pretty much
all times and this is an offset to that.
So you can't look at the mortgage business separately and try to break it out, because when you think about it, it's
given us the time and the earnings to get the margin going again. And we'll talk about that a little bit later. But it is
an integral part of the business, part of our strategy, part of our internal hedge to optimize earnings in any rate
environment. For all the reasons we maintain a positive GAAP is that we know that this business can cover for
[ph] any (00:09:19) period of time of falling rates.
So to consider it outside as separate, this is an integral part. As I said, an integral part of what we do and it's an
integral part of our strategic plan and how we manage the balance sheet, manage earnings. So even when they
fall off we get another couple quarters of really strong margins, they're not going to fall off in total. By then, we
believe that the margin will be back at 2.75 range as we grow. We are a growth company, we will grow through
this, as evidenced by growing almost $10 billion – over $10 billion in the last year alone. We have a great halo
effect going and we'll talk about the deposit growth in a second.
On another note, wealth management revenue continues to track to be – was back on track to $25 million. Assets
under administration grew $1.2 billion or 4.3% to $28.2 billion. Growth was in all three business areas, trust, the
broker-dealer and asset management. The majority of the growth occurred in asset management, institutional
accounts accounted about $0.9 billion of that growth [indiscernible] (00:10:25) good revenue going forward.

Again, the net overhead ratio [ph] 85 or (00:10:28) 87 basis points well below 1.5% and that certainly helps mostly
from the mortgage business. And that's evidenced – it makes up for the margin decline we hope to pick up going
forward.
On the balance sheet front, we grew $200 million in total assets to $43.7 billion. Our earning assets were up $1
billion. Average earning assets, $39.8 billion from 38.7 billion. Our loans grew $700 million. In a period of time
where people – our competitors are not having loan growth, our loan growth is very good and our pipeline is
stronger than ever. We have a $500 million head start given the average standing balance. And again our loan
pipeline is extremely strong. We expect very good core growth – loan growth in the quarter.
On a positive front, we grew $192 million. That's a little bit misleading kind of a tale of – well, let me go back a
second if I could. On the PPP loans, balance has actually increased in the quarter by $44 million to $3.38 billion.
Currently, $1.25 billion and 4,000 loans under forgiveness process, about a-third of the portfolio is in the
[indiscernible] (00:11:55) for forgiveness.
The deposit story we've said $192 million quarter-over-quarter but it's a story within a story. As mentioned in the
last earnings call, deposits as of that date, when we had the last earnings call, about $1 billion less than a quarter
at the end of the second quarter which means we [ph] got (00:12:18) $1.2 billion in core lower cost deposits as
these deposit ran off or higher deposit costs. And the $1.2 billion is more core and a result of our business
development, the halo effect on PPP and continued general growth throughout the franchise.
Pardon me. In Q4 we've arranged to return approximately $600 million of institutional deposits we have brought
on to fund PPP loans and for general liquidity at the end of Q1 when the world was getting pretty crazy. The core
deposit growth remains strong. So, we do expect the core deposits will grow to offset that decrease but again at
lower cost.
And I'll turn it over to Dave who's going to talk about other income and other expense.

David A. Dykstra
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thank you, Ed. Ed touched on the wealth management revenue a bit, but in the non-interest section that wealth
management revenue increased $2.3 million to $25.0 million in the third quarter compared to $22.6 million in the
second quarter and was up 4% from the $24.0 million recorded in the year ago quarter.
The revenue source has been positively impacted by higher equity valuations which impact the pricing on a
portion of our managed asset accounts and also due a higher level of trading in our brokerage accounts from the
depressed levels that we saw in the second quarter this year.
On the mortgage banking revenue front, it Increased by 6% or $6.2 million to $108.5 million in the third quarter
from $102.3 million recorded in the prior quarter and was up a strong 113% from the $50.9 million recorded in the
third quarter of last year. The company originated $2.2 billion of mortgage loans for sale in the third quarter,
essentially the same as the originations that we had in the prior quarter and was up from the $1.4 billion of
originations in the third quarter of last year.
The increase in this category's revenue from the prior quarter resulted primarily from an increase in mortgage
servicing revenue as a result of the larger servicing portfolio and a higher level of capitalization of MSRs and a
smaller negative MSR valuation adjustment during the third quarter relative to the second quarter. The production
revenue was relatively stable, but up slightly as the production margin on similar volume stayed level with the

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
prior quarter. These aforementioned increases in mortgage revenue were offset somewhat by an additional
expense accrual of approximately $3.1 million in the third quarter for the settlement of a long standing recourse
obligation dispute. That puts that dispute to rest. It's been out there related to loans that were basically a decade
old and we felt it was appropriate just to put that dispute to bed.
We currently expect originations in the fourth quarter of 2020 to be strong; although there may be some
seasonality. We'll see how it works out. Winter months tend to slow the purchase business a little bit and there are
holidays involved in November and December, but the pipeline is very strong. We expect it to be a strong fourth
quarter. Margins may come down a little bit depending on that volume. We'll see how it works out, but for fourth
quarter of the year, we expect it to be extraordinarily strong. Table 16 of our earnings release provides the detail
of all the mortgage banking revenue components if you want to dig into that further. Other non-interest income
totaled $13.3 million in the third quarter down approximately $1.4 million from the $14.7 million recorded in the
prior quarter. The largest decline of revenue in this category related to lower swap fee income of approximately
$1.7 million. There were a variety of other smaller positive and negative variances in this category that essentially
offset each other.
Turning to the non-interest expense categories; non-interest expense totaled $264.2 million in the third quarter, up
approximately $4.9 million or 2% from the $259.4 million recorded in the prior quarter. Turning to the more
significant changes quarter-over-quarter. The salaries and employee benefit category increased approximately
$9.9 million in the third quarter from the second quarter of this year. The biggest portions of that are the employee
benefit expense which accounted for about half of the total increase and was up approximately $4.8 million from
the prior quarter. And that was due primarily to substantial increases in employee insurance claims as employees
have begun to return to a more normal pattern of seeking health care, and they also are catching up on services
such as discretionary doctors' visits and surgeries which have been deferred during the early stages of the
coronavirus pandemic.
Accordingly, the second quarter expense was unusually low and the third quarter expense was unusually high.
However, the average of the two quarters is generally in line with the prior quarter run rates and our expectations.
Additionally, salaries expense was up approximately $2.8 million from the second quarter. The primary cause of
the increase was approximately $1.6 million of lower deferred salary cost relative to the prior quarter which had
higher deferred costs related to the PPP loan volumes that we had in 2Q; so less of salary deferrals in the third
quarter because we didn't do the substantial amount of PPP loans in the third quarter. Additionally, the company
incurred a little bit more expense to support the significant mortgage volume being processed through the system.
Commissions and incentive comp expense increased approximately $2.3 million in the third quarter. That change
was driven largely by additional commissions related to wealth management and brokerage trading activity as
well as higher incentive compensation expense recorded during the third quarter relative to the second quarter.
Data processing expense decreased approximately $4.7 million in the third quarter compared to the second
quarter due primarily to approximately $4.5 million of conversion charges incurred related to the Countryside
acquisition in the second quarter, and whereas the third quarter was void of any such acquisition related
conversion charges. Professional fees declined by $1.2 million to $6.5 million in the third quarter compared to the
$7.7 million recorded in the prior quarter. Now, these professional fees can fluctuate on a quarterly basis based
upon the level of legal services related to acquisitions, litigation, problem loan workout as well as consulting
services. This category of expenses was down slightly from the prior quarter due to small declines and a variety of
expense types but nothing of any significance related to any particular category. The professional fees categories
averaged about $7.3 million over the past five quarters, so the current $6.5 million is a little less than that but
within what we think is a normal range.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Equipment expense totaled $17.3 million in the third quarter; that's an increase of $1.4 million as compared to the
second quarter. The increase is due to increased software licensing expenses including some increases related
to increased online mortgage usage, PPP loan servicing enhancements, network upgrades to support our growth
in digital enhancements and various other software upgrades, and we'll continue to invest in software and
technology to enhance our customer delivery systems and products as well as investment systems and support
our continued growth. Other than those expenses that I just discussed, all other expense categories were actually
down on an aggregate basis by approximately $524,000 from the second quarter. Ed mentioned that net
overhead ratio stood at 87 basis points which is down 6 basis points from the 93 basis points recorded in the
second quarter and on the year-to-date basis, the net overhead ratio was 1.03%. The ratio continues to benefit
from strong balance sheet growth and strong mortgage banking results.
Moving on to income tax expense. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of this year was approximately 21.8%
which is well below the 26% to 27% range that we would normally expect. The reason for the lower tax rate in the
third quarter related to $7.1 million net income tax benefit recorded during the third quarter related to the
settlement of an uncertain tax position with taxing authorities. We'd anticipate the effective rate to return to the
expected rate of 26% to 27% in the future quarters barring any unanticipated events. I'd also like to take a few
seconds to address the preferred stock dividends. There seem to be some confusion out there if I look at some of
the analyst estimates on what the preferred stock dividends should be on a going forward basis. So, the company
recorded $10.3 million of preferred stock dividends in the third quarter. However, on a going forward basis, given
the existing outstanding issuances and dividend rates, and if declared by the board of directors, the amount of
preferred dividends recorded should approximate $7.0 million.
The reason for the higher amount in the third quarter was that the first dividend period was of a five-month period.
There was really a two-month stub period in May and June and then the normal quarterly period for the third
quarter. So, in the first period, the dividend declaration included five months, but in all subsequent periods, the
dividend should be a three-month period. So, slightly high in the third quarter here at $10.3 million, but going
forward given the existing issuances, rates, et cetera, that amount should be $7.0 million; so just wanted to clear
that up as there seemed to be some confusion about that.
And with that, I will turn my comments back over to Ed.

Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Dave. I got to say we're very pleased with the quarter. I couldn't be proud of the Wintrust team, the
strategic agility they've displayed throughout these unusual times. As Rich Murphy put it once, he said this is a
miracle. We're able to operate from home and put up these numbers and grow like we are and keep credit where
it is. It's really hats off to the entire Wintrust team. Our approach going forward is really very simple. We need to
grow through part of this cycle by taking what the market gives us. Right now, that means organic growth.
Acquisition market is currently nonexistent through the valuations – pardon me – and uncertainty as to credit – as
to target – the target's credit. We will believe there'll be opportunities as we get closer to the end of the pandemic,
but as of now there isn't a lot going on. We need to monitor balance sheet in order to optimize net interest income
and the NIM as PPP loans continue through the forgiveness pipeline. Given our asset-sensitive position, we do
have room for some fixed-rate exposure and we will be looking for opportunities in this area. Although I'm not
really excited about what happens on mortgage backs, there are some opportunities and some things we'll be
doing in the future that will help earning asset yields and help the margin.
Our pipelines are stronger than ever. We're ready for PPP 2 if that occurs. We continue to monitor credit very,
very closely. As you know, there'll be some cracks coming. However, reserves are robust. Our current metrics are

off the chart, good. We're comfortable with current levels – our current reserve levels are appropriate. Note that
we will not change our conservative consistent underwriting parameters and policies for any reason whatsoever.
I'd like to go back to that core net interest margin concept that I threw out before, the $237 million June to
September. We believe that's a low point, barring additional lowering of rates, overall rate environment going
lower. Our pipeline is strong. If we believe that we can add $1 billion little loans of this quarter and $0.5 million in
investments and put the spreads out, that's a $9 million to $10 million quarterly impact for us. That's what we're
doing. We've got a lot of liquidity. We have the liquidity here. We could allow liquidity at the beginning of the
period of – really the second quarter was because of the unusual times [indiscernible] (00:25:42) drew on their
lines, we think, that was going to continue at PPP loans. We're letting some of that expensive liquidity run off. It's
being replaced by core deposits at cheaper rates.
And so that's the plan going forward is to grow without that commensurate increase in expenses. And we've been
able to do so as indicated by this quarter another $1 billion to our regular deposit growth and $700 million worth of
loans. We expect that to continue going forward. It's going to take some time to work through this. The PPP has
found money as far as I'm concerned. And the mortgage business is going to continue to support us until such
time as we can continue to build the earning asset base up, get a little bit more certainty in the market as to where
we're going. But our net interest rate sensitivity position right now is around – our net GAAP is around 12% or
13%. As COVID runs off, that was about 18%, which is – we'd like to keep it between 10% and 12%. We've got
COVID – not COVID, as the PPP loans run off, they're on at a two-year average life, I guess, in our GAAP
calculations. So we do have room there to add some fixed rate assets on both sides of the equation and still
maintain a very positive GAAP. Again, you have to look at Wintrust in total. You have to look at our margin. You
have to look at our mortgage business. All of these are internal hedges helping various interest rate times. So to
pull one out and say that's not going to continue without giving credit for the other side of the equation doesn't
make a lot of sense.
I know we've got a question on stock buybacks. And as you guys go forward in the question-and-answer period,
I'll say we are considering it as we always do. Right now, if we just run the numbers, it might make some sense to
do it because it's accretive to both earnings and tangible book value, but in any acquisition you can do and we're
sitting at about $400 million to $500 million worth of cash right now that's available. We'd like to keep our cash in
the holding company but we have that opportunity of, if the board still wants to go that way. So with that, thank
you for your support. We really appreciate it. Have faith in Wintrust, we put through the Wintrust management
team. We have your best interest at hearts because your interests are the same as ours. So with that, we'll have
to turnover to questions. Thank you.

Yeah. I thought it was a pretty good quarter, but obviously people have questions about the outlook. And I guess
maybe I'll talk about growth and the margin, but in terms of growth, it's unusual to see the kind of growth that you
saw. And maybe you could touch on big picture what you think is different and do you think you can offset the
PPP run off and actually show stable than maybe higher loans?

Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I think based on the pipeline, the commercial and commercial real estate pipeline, yes. It's higher than it's
been in a long time right now. Our pull-through rates are consistent. Our premium finance business continues.
The life insurance business continues to grow nicely and the commercial business continues to grow nicely. The
average ticket size is relatively constant around $38,000, $39,000 bucks. I wish it was million bucks on the
commercial side. So we believe that we'll continue to have really good core loan growth at least for the
foreseeable future on our terms still. We're not bending credit to get there, I'm telling you. A lot of it is the PPP
halo effect pull-through and we're seeing an echo effect of that because the people who are pulling through are
referring us to other people. These are good accounts were taken from the larger banks in town, nobody in
particular. It's everybody in total proportionately, but it seems like we've got very good momentum, carried good
reputational momentum and our name is out there. So we feel very good about our growth prospects. And that's
an integral part of what we have to do here is to grow through this. That being said, if in fact we saw things turn,
you couldn't get paid for your risk, saw lots of exceptions coming through. Won't be afraid to shut it down right
now like we did in the past, but we have a shoe to fall but we're not seeing that now. Rich, do you agree?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. No. I'd say, Jon, you know our business model well. And one of the things that we always say is, we will
take what the market gives us. And so last year, CRE was a big contributor to growth. C&I, less so, because of
some of the things Ed talked about. We weren't getting paid for the risk and the structure's got just a little bit
crazy. So, one of the things that's really encouraging so far this year is just the way that that growth is coming in.
It's really very balanced. CRE is still a contributor but we're seeing good C&I growth. As Ed pointed out, we're
seeing good growth out of the niches. We're seeing good growth out of the premium finance area. So, one of the
things that really keeps me confident is just that all those engines are running pretty well right now. So, if you took
the first three quarters and you netted out mortgages held for sale and netted out PPP loans, we're on an
annualized track of about 8%. And that really requires everybody to kind of be getting their work done. And based
on what we're seeing in the pipelines for all those, we're continuing to feel pretty good about loan growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
But the amazing thing to me is, and we'll talk about this a lot is, a lot of the old time, really old names in Chicago,
names you would recognize are now doing business with us. They've had long term relationships with the larger
banks in town and they're getting kind of fed up. You'd be amazed that some of the names we're dealing with and
they tell their friends and they tell their friends; so little bit of a pyramid effect going on here which we're very
happy to be a recipient of.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right. Well, that's good. And then in terms of the margin – getting the margin back to that 270-plus type
level, I understand the strategy, but just talk a little bit about the cadence. How long do you think that will take to
get back to those levels?

Well, PPP has got a run off and leave us with liquidity, if you take it in and we've got to be able to put that liquidity
to work plus we have to take the $3 billion we have of overnight money and put that to work. Well, currently 80%

loan to deposit core basis, 90% with the PPP loans included. We've got to run about 90% and if you figure the
growth that will be in here, returns of deposit we're putting in, we think it'll take two to three quarters, barring
anything else. I would say around two quarters of, if everything stays where it is, we manage the funding properly.
That's where we think we'll – it'll take about two quarters to get there, but it's all a function of what's going on in
the markets. And if everything holds as it is right now, I would say in two quarters we'll be back, but other things
can change. You get a lot more – I mean the deposit growth has been incredible for it. Absolutely. Core deposit
growth is incredible. We're not going to turn it down because these are really good clients, really good
businesses. We've got to get that to raw material. I'll take it all day at the prices we're getting to that now as we
bring in relationships with them because eventually those turn into larger relationships and lending relationships.
Just to give you an idea, Tim Crane is here. Tim, why don't you talk about what's going on in the treasury
department right now at least in the last quarter what happened?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Sure, Ed. And Ed's talked about the halo effect. This is one of the follow on pieces to both the PPP opportunity
and any other credit opportunities to the treasury and services revenue that comes with. And so we've had to add
staff to handle the implementations that continue to come to us. And we'll do that probably through at least the
end of the year with the treasury revenue really just starting to show up probably in the beginning of the fourth
quarter here and we think that will be relatively significant for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A

Picked up almost 140 accounts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A

160 just already implemented with a number in the pipeline waiting to get set up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. And revenue on that could be over $2 million annualized. So, there's a lot of things going on here. And
we've got to grow through this and keep our expenses under control. That's got to be the secret here to get
earnings back and be prepared for higher rates because the beach ball on the water we talked about 10 years
ago, Jon, I think that one's deflated. Now we got to get another one down there, but it's bigger than it's ever been.

Hey guys, thanks for the question. Dave, on the mortgage business you talked, I think, about the potential for
margins to come in a bit. Maybe you could elaborate on how meaningful given how much they've expanded year-
on-year?

David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, a lot of it really just depends on where the pipelines are going. I mean right now they look pretty full, but if
they decline and the margins generally decline as the pipeline comes down because people raised the margins as
they're trying to govern the amount of flow coming in. So, I think you could be in – I think it could potentially have
a three handle on the margins next quarter, but Chris I said that last quarter too. I thought volumes would come in
a little bit and margins would come down, and the application flow was just astounding to us and that it stayed
where it was. And the purchase activity really bumped up in the third quarter and generally second quarter is
bigger. And there's still a lot of purchase activity going on out there in the marketplace. So, I could be surprised
again, but the fourth quarter also has holidays where some people defer their actions or just don't do it and
there're more holiday days in the quarter. So, that could impact it too but I'm not going to give a specific number
because I tried to give that guidance last quarter and I was wrong, but I think if it tails off a little bit in the winter
months, they could come down to the 3s.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Thanks. And just one more, with the prospects of taxes going up, can you remind me if anything is
structurally different than when you guys got the benefit in 2016 in terms of just sensitivity to each point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well no – well, we were a deferred tax liability at the time, so there is some benefit. We still have a deferred
tax liability. There are some tax planning strategies we could do. So if there is a change in Congress and the
administration and it looks like there could be some increases in taxes, there are some elections we can take on
depreciation and the timing of certain expenses that we think we can mitigate some of the increased cost of that
tax law change, but we are in a deferred tax liability. So when we benefited last time when rates went down, it
would be a negative to us, but it could be – if you look at our current deferred tax liability, like a $20 million
number, but I think we can mitigate that substantially. So there may be some impact but I don't expect it to be
material.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good afternoon, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Hi David. How are you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
I'm doing well. I'm sure you guys are doing well after a great report like you put up last night. With regard to the
balance sheet and the size of the balance sheet, your clients seem pretty liquid. You've seen nice deposit growth.
Do you expect deposit balances to come down at some point and does that hinder your ability to invest some of
the cash you have?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we're kind of floating in there right now and one of the reasons we haven't run along yet is exactly that, is
the money going to stay. We usually – we don't know how much of it is PPP money that hasn't been spent and
will that go out. If it does go out, where will it go? Will it go into personal accounts and then to Wintrust Wealth
Management? But we do believe that deposit growth and market share growth will remain strong just by virtue of
the number of clients we're picking up on the commercial side and on the retail side as a result of the halo effect
and the echo of the halo effect. So, I think we're okay in terms of deposits. I'll worry about that if it happens
because by now, everybody's having too much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then in your reserve today, what assumptions are you using for future stimulus?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
That's a good question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We don't have anything substantial in there for guessing whether it's going to be $3 trillion or $500 billion.
So if there is more stimulus we think that'll help us. I think Moody's assumed some continued stimulus. So, what
Moody's has in there is what our models would have because we use Moody's economic scenarios but we aren't
putting any qualitative impacts into the assumption to say we think that there's going to be a ton of stimulus. So
what Moody's got, it's got in for additional stimulus' what our models run with.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
What scares me about the PPP round data, if you do a change in administrations or what happens to TARP when
the administration changed last time, it changed all the rules, and well you were going to have to offer it but it may
not be is as simple as this really is right now or as the first PPP was, but as I said before the government is not

the best counterparty they have. We do have to take care of our clients. There's a need out there and I'm thinking
it's on our projections. What I'm thinking if it did come was reasonable, it'll be $1 billion for us; a third of what we
had before to our existing customers and open the lines for additional customers coming in. So, that will be a
good thing but I expect it to be kind of lumpier than this one.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. And then just the last thing if I can; on the mortgage side of things, the Fannie Freddie 50 basis point
charge expected to start here in December. Has that had any impact on volumes or spreads at this point or do
you expect it to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well we've built it in last time it came. We've got it built into our pricing models right now. So we don't expect that
– the fact that they – if they had not delayed it. It would have eaten into our margins a little bit, but given the fact
they delayed it, we've pretty much built that into our pricing schedules now.

Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Mr. Crane, do you want to answer that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, Brock. As you guys saw the interest bearing deposit costs went from $81 million to $61 million, and you're
correct, we believe we continue to have some room, about – more than half of the CD book will re-price in the
next year. That's moving from the 170s to about 60 basis points, 65 basis points. And so you're correct. I think
you'll see continued progress in moving our funding costs down in the next couple of quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
What was the low point is the, if you took the low for each category, you get into the mid-30s. So I think an early
look now would get us 40-ish or slightly below given what we see in terms of a normal run rate on CD repricing.
So over time, I think 35 basis points was the low we had. The last time we have one of these rate environments
and we would expect to get there probably mid next year.

Brock Vandervliet Q

Great. And most competitors are flat – by flat in terms of loan growth. I hear you in terms of talking about picking
up new clients. Clearly, that's driving some of it. What was your loan utilization in the quarter? I believe it was $49
million last quarter. Has that picked up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A

Stayed around $50 million.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A

[indiscernible] (00:46:20) I guess.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Exactly. Ed, you mentioned a couple times in your prepared remarks you're starting to see some cracks and
there're some losses coming, I think, was the expression. I was wondering if you could expand on that. Is that the
hotel portfolio which still has higher deferrals or there are some other kind of segments within the portfolio that
was behind that statement?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No. It wasn't a specific statement. We don't see them now, but we're on lookout for them. We've always been –
our first loss is our best loss. If we got an issue, we'll take care of it right out of the box, but my point was we're not
naïve enough to think that we'll get through this unscathed. I can't tell you where or how but something's going to
hit and somewhere, somehow surprisingly, the franchise portfolio is doing pretty well and our hotel exposure is
basically nothing.
Rich, do you want to talk about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I know, I think you answered the question exactly right. I mean we look at all the materials, classified assets
all the time. If something is really problematic, we're going to market accordingly and move on. But things, as
generally speaking, are holding together pretty well. As I've said, the high risk portfolios that we laid out for the
last couple of quarters have performed amazingly well. The franchise portfolio is largely made up of QSRs, and I
asked the question to that group this morning about; are we back to pre-pandemic levels in that space and pretty
much at or above because they have modified their business models so much.
Again, hotels are – I can count on our hotel deals on one hand. There's just not that many. Energy again, we're
not a big energy lender. So I don't know where we're going to see some of these things pop as we've talked about
in prior quarters. You have some COVID-related industries that we have borrowers in those that are really highly
affected. Things that are in the tourism, things that are in more of the restaurant that is maybe not in franchise. I
mean it's hard to say exactly where but if this pandemic continues throughout better part of next year, I mean
there's going to be real challenges on those types of credits, but for right now, we're feeling okay.

And I think that has all been accounted for in the buildup of the reserves that we have right now. So I'd just go
back to [indiscernible] (00:49:01) saying, just because [indiscernible] (00:49:05) doesn't mean you shouldn't look
over your shoulder. We've got to be very vigilant and stay on this. Don't let anybody get complacent. But we don't
see it right now. As I said at the beginning of my comments, you wouldn't think there was a pandemic or any crisis
going on looking at our credit book right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then just as a follow-up maybe for Dave. I was hoping to get your initial thoughts on expenses in 2021. It
looks like maybe advertising and marketing are down $5 million year-over-year. So that's going to normalize, we
hope. So that's about a $20 million increase, but what else – anything else stands out as you think about next
year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No. We're going to, obviously, always have a little bit of salary increase for merit and pay, but we're going to try to
hold the line as much as we can on the staffing front. If you look at what we did on the – we had some one-time
[indiscernible] (00:50:07) even in this quarter. I mean we had $6 million of contingent consideration on the earn-
out this quarter and had $7 million last quarter. So there's $13 million there. We had the settlement of some of
these recourse obligations from – had been going on for years that there's probably a few million dollars there, a
difference from what you would have that we think we've put behind us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Acquisitions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
And acquisition costs were in there. Last quarter, we just had $4.5 million alone just on the conversion charges.
So, I mean, I think there are some numbers in there that just aren't going to happen again next year. But we
would hope that we could, as Ed said, try to grow the deposit and the loan side of the equation and hold the line
on expenses.
There will be some increase, like you saw, this quarter just on the technology and software side as we build out
our digital platform and customer-facing systems. But hopefully that helps on efficiencies and other areas of the
businesses as far as the branches and the people we have, etcetera – there's offsets out there. So, I don't have a
specific number for you, Terry, but trying to hold the line on expense growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We are going through and looking at our branch network. We're looking at the number of people who – we
have not laid anybody off or furloughed anyone during this period of time. We've been able to repurpose them into
PPP and what have you. But I think that we have developed some efficiencies through this process to be carried
through and just do normal attrition.

We should be able to bring our head count relatively speaking down a bit because of this. Once we get to the
PPP forgiveness which is becoming somewhat laborsome and we're growing at the same time. So a lot of them,
we had to repurpose people to do that. So I think we're going be okay in that regard. We'll see though. It'll be –
who knows what next year is going to bring in terms of opportunities and in terms of growth.

Nathan J. Race Q

Just follow-up on your comments just now around office locations and so forth. We've seen from some compares
in Chicago that they've closed some locations just given that branch traffic has flowed considerably with
economies closing down and so forth. Just curious what you're seeing in terms of the magnitude of opportunities if
you guys do go down a branch consolidation path like you were just talking to.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A

Go ahead, Tim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yes. As we mentioned in the last call, number one, we're seeing the change, the increase in the use of electronic
services at the other banks and that's encouraging to us. And we're also seeing obviously a different pattern in
terms of how clients use our facilities. We're nearing the end of analysis that I would guess will result in the
closure of some number of branches.
I don't think it'll be trajectory changing, but it'll be roughly comparable to what you're seeing with some others. The
important piece though I think is that we still think there are markets we'd like to be in. So whether those are
underserved markets or they are markets that we find particularly attractive we will also continue to selectively
add some locations. But both to Ed's point about how efficiently we can run the locations that are open and then
ultimately the number of locations we need, we think there will be opportunities.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's very helpful. Just changing gears a little bit and thinking about the commercial real estate growth in
the quarter. I think the one item that stood out to me in some of the tables, I think in table one in particular was the
growth out of state in other parts of the country that you guys don't outline specifically within that table.
So I guess is that just a function of you guys following some existing developers and clients to other parts of the
country or is it just like you guys alluded to earlier, just new clients adds that are occurring in geographies that are
a little more attractive from an underlying perspective than what's happening in Illinois and other surrounding
states
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Rich want to handle that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Sure. Yeah. So, I think you anticipated my answer to that question. We have a really good client base that we've
dealt with for a long time that as we've become – gained expertise over the years and started looking at really
expanding our Wintrust presence in the commercial real estate area. We've built up a very nice stable of good
sponsors. As time has gone on, they've asked us to follow them out to some of the opportunities they've seen in
different markets from Texas to Colorado to out on the East Coast, Florida.
And we're generally happy to follow them on those, we don't do them all but generally speaking we'd like the
professionals that we're doing business with and lending money to. And so we try to understand those markets.
We get a good handle on it, but it truly is a function of following the people that we've banked for a long time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
General rule around here is our core portfolio has to have Chicago nexus and its portfolio can go anywhere in the

our market area.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Hi. Thanks. A couple of questions for you, starting with mortgage banking. Clearly, this year it's a blowout year,
double the revenue of the prior year and I was curious if we were to go back, if we look out to 2021 and of course
2021 is probably going to be a strong year also. But hypothetically if mortgage banking revenue were to go back
to 2019's level, how much of an expense reduction would come with that? So, if we were take 2020 and kind of
divide that revenue in half looking out to either next year or the following year, how much of an expense reduction
would be related to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Pretty much the same percentage. We're using a lot of contracted labor now. Our ability to contract our expense
base as the market contracts, you might lose a month there but basically on a run rate basis you should be –
we've designed it so, you're going to [indiscernible] (00:57:45) down relatively quickly. Murph you want to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, that's exactly right. I mean we have become much more nimble in terms of our ability to step up and
correspondingly step down as the volumes dictate. It won't be a, let's say, exactly one for one at any given point
time but it'll be close.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I think generally the efficiency ratio in that business has been around 80% or so. One of the reasons our efficiency
ratio is higher than our peers is we have a higher percent of our revenues in the mortgage banking area. So,
there's a substantial amount of expenses that would come out of that equation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I think the difference between that 2019 to 2021 will be one, our use of contract labor and two our use of the front-
end that's working wonderfully now. The old days the front end was manual. It's all now – it's all digitalized, taking
costs out of business. The third is a lot of the work that doesn't touch the customer is being done offshore on a
per deal basis. So those will fall off also.
So, I think compared to the – I think we talked about this in 2019, those were our initiatives. And now they're in full
swing right now. And so, I think that the costs are now more per unit than they were fixed before.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I can tell you that every time Ed talks with our senior leadership team in the mortgage department, he says
congratulations on a great month. How are you going to get your costs down when the revenue goes away? So,
it's definitely a focus.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I'm becoming predictable. I don't like that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks for that color. And then shifting to the provision outlook, $25 million in this quarter is clearly down
substantially from the second quarter. How should we think about the go-forward provision? I know it's a very
uncertain environment, but is $25 million kind of a good baseline going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, you know, I mean – you know, theoretically, Dave, if you think about CECL, it's a life of loan concept. So if
the portfolio didn't grow and the credit quality stayed the same and the economic outlook was the same, you'd
have zero, right? So the drivers for that are going to be if we have growth we'll have to provide for that growth. If
the portfolio would deteriorate or get better, it would go up or down. And then it really depends on the economic
scenarios, which drives it quite a bit.
So, I think you'd kind of look at this and have to just think about where you think the quality – the credit quality and
growth is going to go on the portfolio. And then if they have stimulus and the economy gets better, I mean
theoretically you could say banks could start releasing reserves. And I don't think we're in that position yet
because we're not – you're not seeing the economic scenario change dramatically.
But I think what's going to drive our provision going forward right now, as I look at it, would just be is the portfolio
going to grow? And that was – this quarter, you could see that we had some growth in the portfolio that helped
drive that number up a little bit. And credit quality is, knock-on-wood, holding in there right now. So CECL is
awfully complicated from that perspective. But I think the issue really is growth here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
That makes sense. And last one for me is right where you just left off there on loan growth. You mentioned about
how pipelines are stronger than ever. What type of borrowers are you seeing the most demand from in terms of
loan growth? And I guess related question to that, are distressed investors swooping in and purchasing CRE at
this time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I can handle the first part, and then I'll get into the second part. So where we're seeing activity is really in Chicago,
in the Chicago market. The pie I don't think is growing all that much. We just continue to grow our share of that
pie. So we've talked for the last couple of quarters and on this call about the halo effect of PPP and it is very real.
I mean, not a – one of our credit approval meetings goes by where we're not seeing a deal come out of pick your
big bank because they're just frustrated with the way that they handle PPP, the way that they have sort of
evolved, which is a much less banker-focused model, more call center-oriented.
And as a result, you were just getting [indiscernible] (01:02:49) more often. Every time there's a deal that comes
to market, we're sort of the guys sitting at the table. So it really has I mean, as I had said earlier in the call that our
22

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
visibility in the market is I think dramatically different than if you go back a couple of years. And even if you go
back just this time last year, we sit in a different position the quality of the borrower we're seeing, where they're
coming from. It's a good place to be right now.
As it relates to the distressed assets and yeah, we are seeing – every day in my inbox there's probably another 10
people sending notes saying, hey, we're interested in buying your hospitality portfolio. We're interested in buying
your CRE portfolio. And I think it's just they send it out to everybody because they're just trying to find as many
assets out there as possible. So there are a lot of people out there looking for distressed assets.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Young with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities
Hi, thanks for the question. Maybe just wanted to ask, kind of, big picture if there was going to be some KPIs or
more high level articulation of financial targets kind of on the heels of some of this disruption. I know you guys did
some of the management reorganization to free up some bandwidth to kind of evaluate strategy. So I just don't
know if there was anything that had come of that or that we should expect in the future from that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, I don't think we're going to give any sort of different guidance out there right now. I mean, the overall strategy
is what we're looking at. And some of those, as I said, this is a very diversified business model here that if you set
some of those goals and the mortgage market is stronger than sort of the interest rate environment has been
recently or vice versa, if rates go up and the margin expands and mortgages go down, some of those KPIs would
change dramatically. So, we're trying to manage the overall business and the diversified nature of it.
And I think if we start to provide you with very granular KPIs out there, we're going to be explaining why they're
changing all the time because the business is somewhat fluid. And so we take what the market gives us. We try to
stay diversified. We try to take advantage of the revenue streams where they're at. And that – you have to be able
to adapt over time and not corner yourselves into certain KPIs and say, geez, we have to meet those because
you'll give up on some other aspect of the business.
But rest assured, as Ed said earlier, we are big shareholders of this relative to our net worth. And we manage just
like shareholders and we manage it for the long-term and not for quarterly returns. And so we'll continue to do
that. But I'm not so certain that we're going to put out more KPIs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities
Okay. That's fair. And then just on, kind of, back on the growth question, I guess. You kind of mentioned on your
own credit, things are good, but you're worried something might pop up. And I'm just curious how you've shifted
maybe underwriting in terms of structure on new loans that you're pursuing to make sure that there's an
appropriate margin of error safety on new loan originations, will it be CRE or C&I, that'd be helpful.

Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
We don't change our own policy basically for anything. This business hasn't changed since the Medicis in
Florence. So we don't try to follow the herd, any way shape or form, but we have very conserved underwriting
standards. As our history would tell you, we don't change a lot of them. Go ahead, Murph.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, Ed's, right. I mean, I think we have been pretty consistent in the way that we underwrite credit and the
way we structure deals. I'd say to your point though, C&I, I wouldn't say, we're doing a whole lot of overlays there
from an underwriting perspective. I'd say in the CRE space, we're trying to be very mindful of what potential
vacancy rates could look like in different segments. We're not doing a whole lot of office deals right now, but we're
certainly – we talk a lot about what's the core pro forma vacancy rates that you could applied to those.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Retail.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Retail, we don't do any really right now. But certainly, when we're doing reviews on those, we are – we kind of put
those...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Stress them out...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
...stress them out to a higher level of vacancy. But in the new deals that we are doing, we are trying to be very
mindful of the things that we are concerned about. I would say like in Illinois, we are looking at real estate taxes
and thinking about okay, here's where they're at. How much stress in those real estate tax expenses can we
absorb here? So, I'd say if anything, that's probably the area of most focus right now is on those CRE deals and
kind of doing the what-if scenarios on them to really understand them.
But again, I think the biggest thing that we really do focus on and one of the things that we're – as we look through
our existing portfolio is, your sponsor selection is really critical. I mean, if you went in to this last six months with
weaker deals and weaker sponsors, you're going to have a rough ride ahead of you. But we have seen in number
of instances where we've seen sponsors step up and resized the deal and support deals where appropriate. And
ultimately, that's what your protection.

Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities
Okay. Thanks
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. And our last question is from Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Brock, you come back for a [indiscernible] (01:09:10)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I just can't get enough. I wondered if you could just briefly walk through the PPP dynamics on the NIM. Was that
change related to a change in the term from, say, two years to five or driven by an update on the level of
forgiveness that you're seeing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, it's really driven on the timing of the forgiveness that we're seeing. Based upon the customer surveys and
the customer responses that we did, we thought the forgiveness would happen quicker. So we thought the cash
flows would come in quicker. Then there's all this talk about, maybe Congress will pass a law that gives a one-
page form for everything under $150,000. And some people talked about it – or $150,000 – yeah, $150,000.
Some people talked about even higher numbers.
So we have a lot of accountants and lawyers advising our clients that, hey, why don't you just sit back? No reason
for you to fill out this lengthy forgiveness application if a simpler easier one is going to come through. And so a lot
of people have sort of held off. With that being said, about a-third of our portfolio has got applications in now.
Some of them have gone all the way through the process and we've got the cash. Others are actually at the SBA
waiting for the final process.
So we have them in different stages. It's just that that flow backed up on us a little bit because of the anticipation
that Congress or the SBA may give a more simplified streamlined approach to the borrowers. And so if they don't
have to make a payment and they just sat back. So, we thought we'd have more flow in the third and the fourth
quarters, we sort of pushed that back more towards the end of the fourth quarter into the first quarter. And so it's
really you just recalculate what you think your level yield is going to be and how fast the accretion is going to
come in. That makes sense?
