Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the fourth quarter,
Capital One earned $2.6 billion or $5.35 per common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $2.7 billion or
$5.18 per share. Included in EPS for the quarter were two small adjusting items which are outlined on the slide.
Net of these adjusting items, earnings per share for the quarter was $5.29. Full year 2020 adjusted earnings per
share was $5.79.
In addition to the adjusting items in the quarter, we recorded an equity investment gain of $60 million or $0.10 per
share related to our equity stake in Snowflake. For the full year, the investment gain was $535 million or around
$0.89 per share.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2021
Turning to slide 4, I will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail. In the fourth quarter, we released
$593 million of allowance primarily in our Card business. Economic assumptions underlying our allowance
included unemployment of around 8% at the end of 2021 and the impacts of the $900 billion stimulus package
passed in December.
The release was driven by the strong credit performance we have observed and by the new stimulus bill. In our
allowance, we continue to assume that the relationship between the economic metrics and credit quickly reverts
to a historical norm. And we've added significant additional qualitative factors for COVID-related uncertainty. In
our Commercial business, we charged off certain energy loans and released allowance for the specific reserves
that were previously established for those loans.
Turning to slide 5. You can see the allowance coverage levels declined modestly from the prior quarters across
our segments but remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Our Domestic Card coverage is now at 10.8% while
our branded card portfolio coverage is 12.7%. Recall that the difference between these metrics is driven by loss-
sharing agreements in our partnership portfolios. Coverage in our Consumer and Commercial businesses also
remained elevated at 3.9% and 2.2%, respectively.
Moving to slide 6. I'll discuss our liquidity position. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio
during the fourth quarter was 145%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Our liquidity reserves from
cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity declined slightly from the third quarter to end the year at
approximately $144 billion, including about $41 billion in cash driven by continued strong deposits.
Turning to slide 7. You can see that our net interest margin increased 37 basis points quarter-over-quarter to
6.05%. The increase was largely driven by higher card loan revenue margin as strong credit results led to lower
suppression, the impact of third and fourth quarter deposit pricing actions and a modest decline in our cash
balance which was partially offset by lower yields on cash and securities.
Lastly, turning to slide 8. I will cover our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.7% at the
end of the fourth quarter, up 70 basis points from the third quarter and 150 basis points higher than a year ago.
We continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%, which includes a buffer over our capital
requirements under the SCB framework of 10.1%. As we close out 2020, we have approximately 270 basis points
or around $8 billion of capital in excess of our CET1 target.
Following the latest stress test results released by the Federal Reserve last month and in light of the strong
capital position I just described, we expect to restore our quarterly dividend back to $0.40 per share in the first
quarter pending board approval.
Our board of directors has also authorized the repurchase of up to $7.5 billion of the company's common stock
inclusive of share repurchase capacity of up to approximately $500 million in the first quarter based on the Fed's
current trailing four-quarter average earnings rule. The timing and amount of stock repurchase activity will be
informed by our outlook on the economy as well as the actual forecasted levels of capital, earnings and growth.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2021
Thanks, Scott. As I think everyone on this call knows, Scott shared with me in November that he would be leaving
Capital One to join a tech startup. While he will be here through March 15, this will be Scott's last earnings call. So
I want to take a moment and thank you, Scott, for giving so much of your life to Capital One over this past decade,
including the last five years as our CFO.
You've built strong relationships with our shareholders and across the investment community. And you've always
brought their external perspectives to our work inside of Capital One. You've been a key adviser and partner for
me and for the board and a strong leader in our company.
I'm particularly grateful for the legacy you've built, transforming finance technology, strengthening processes and
controls, building a great team of talented leaders, including your successor, Andrew Young. We will miss you
and I'm sure you will continue to do great things.
With that, let me turn to our Domestic Card business. Exceptional credit performance was the biggest driver of
Domestic Card financial results in the quarter. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.69%, a
163 basis point improvement year-over-year and a 95 basis point improvement from the sequential quarter.
The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter-end was 2.42%, 151 basis points better than the prior year. The
delinquency rate was up 21 basis points from the linked quarter, consistent with typical seasonal patterns. Fourth
quarter provision for credit losses improved by $1.1 billion year-over-year, driven by the allowance release that
Scott discussed and lower charge-offs.
Several factors are driving continued credit strength. Consumers are behaving cautiously, spending less, saving
more and paying down debt. These behaviors have been amplified by the cumulative effects of unusually large
government stimulus and widespread forbearance across the banking industry. Our own long-standing resilience
choices put us in a strong position going into the pandemic. And our strategic investments in digital technology
and transformation are paying off in enhanced capabilities and underwriting that are powering our performance
and response to the pandemic.
Strikingly strong consumer credit has persisted throughout 2020 even after the expiration of several parts of the
CARES Act. Uncertainty about future credit trends remains high, especially in the context of an evolving
pandemic that is difficult to predict. As Scott discussed, that uncertainty informs our allowance for credit loss. We
believe that each incremental month of favorable credit reduces the cumulative losses through the downturn
rather than just delaying the impact.
At the end of the fourth quarter, Domestic Card ending loan balances were down $20.1 billion or 17% year-over-
year, driven by three factors, cautious consumer behavior, reduced spending and demand for new credit, and
drove payment rates to historically high levels. Our marketing pullbacks at the outset of the downturn put
additional pressure on loan balances. And we moved a partnership portfolio to held-for-sale in the third quarter.
Excluding the impact of the move to held-for-sale, ending loans declined about 15%. Fourth quarter average
loans declined 16% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, the expected seasonal ramp drove ending loans
up by about 3%.
Purchase volume continued to rebound from the sharp declines early in the pandemic. For the full year, purchase
volume was down 2% in 2020. Fourth quarter purchase volume was essentially flat compared to the prior-year
quarter. That compares to a year-over-year decline of about 30% in the first weeks of the pandemic.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2021
Quarterly purchase volume increased 10% from the sequential quarter, consistent with the expected seasonality
and the continued rebound. Despite the rebound, purchase volume growth is still down compared to the double-
digit growth we were seeing before the pandemic.
Fourth quarter revenue declined 7% year-over-year as a result of the decrease in average loans, partially offset
by higher revenue margin. The revenue margin was up 121 basis points year-over-year to 16.91%, largely driven
by two factors. Strong credit drove lower revenue suppression. And year-over-year, net interchange revenue in
the numerator of the margin is essentially flat, while average loan balances, the denominator of the margin
calculation, are down 16%.
Non-interest expense was down $186 million or 8% from the fourth quarter of last year, largely driven by our
choice to pull back on Domestic Card marketing when the pandemic hit. Total company marketing trends are
largely driven by Domestic Card. Fourth quarter marketing for the total company was down 21% year-over-year.
On a sequential-quarter basis, total company marketing increased significantly in the fourth quarter.
Looking ahead, future marketing will be impacted by how things play out with the pandemic and the economy. In
the midst of the pandemic, we're finding opportunities and we are leaning into them. These opportunities are
enhanced by our tech transformation. The ultimate level of our 2021 marketing will depend on our continuing real-
time assessment of the marketplace.
Slide 12 summarizes fourth quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Driven by our auto business,
ending loans increased 9% year-over-year. Average loans grew 10% for the fourth quarter and 9% for the full
year. When the COVID downturn began, we tightened our underwriting box in auto to focus on the most resilient
assets. We believe that several factors drove our growth. The auto market rebound has been stronger for larger
franchise dealers, the part of the market where we're focused.
Our digital products and services drove growth in direct-to-consumer originations and growth with dealers who
want to provide a low-touch car buying experience in response to social distancing. And our dealer relationship
strategy put us in a strong position to grow high-quality auto loans. Fourth quarter auto originations were down
2% year-over-year. Competition picked up late in the third quarter and continued to increase in the fourth quarter.
Fourth quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $36.7 billion, or 17% year-over-year driven by the
stimulus-driven surge in deposits in the second quarter. Average deposits were up 19% for the fourth quarter and
up 15% for the full year. Our average deposit interest rate decreased 73 basis points year-over-year and 19 basis
points from the linked quarter as we reduced deposit pricing in response to the market interest rate environment
and competitive dynamics.
Fourth quarter Consumer Banking revenue increased 18% from the prior-year quarter. Annual revenue was up
4%. Both increases were driven by growth in auto loans and retail deposits. Annual growth was negatively
impacted by differences in the timing of Federal Reserve rate cuts preceding our deposit pricing reductions. Non-
interest expense in Consumer Banking was up 1% year-over-year.
Fourth quarter provision for credit losses improved by $275 million year-over-year driven by lower charge-offs and
a modest allowance release in our auto business. Fourth quarter credit results in our auto business remain
unusually strong even after seasonal linked-quarter increases of 24 basis points in the auto charge-off rate and
102 basis points in the delinquency rate. Year-over-year, the charge-off rate improved 143 basis points to 0.47%
and the delinquency rate improved 210 basis points to 4.78%.

Strong auto credit is the result of several factors. In addition to the same general drivers of Domestic Card credit
strength, auto credit also benefited from very strong auction values. And our auto forbearance is having a
temporary positive impact particularly on delinquency rates. We've provided updated auto forbearance information
on appendix slide 18. We expect auto credit metrics to increase from their unusually low levels as auction prices
normalize and the temporary impacts of COVID forbearance play out.
Moving to slide 13, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Fourth quarter ending loan balances were up
2% year-over-year, driven by growth in selected C&I and CRE specialties. Average loans were also up 2% for the
fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. Quarterly average deposits increased 21% from the fourth quarter of 2019.
And annual average deposits grew 14% in 2020 as middle market customers continued to bolster their liquidity.
Fourth quarter revenue was up 10% from the prior-year quarter. Annual revenue was up 6% for the year. Annual
revenue growth from higher loan and deposit volumes and higher non-interest income was partially offset by
lower net interest margin. Non-interest expense for the quarter increased by 1% year-over-year. Provision for
credit losses improved by $90 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The allowance release that Scott
discussed was partially offset by higher charge-offs largely related to our oil and gas portfolio. Our oil and gas
exposure declined year-over-year. We've provided a breakout of our oil and gas portfolio composition and
reserves on appendix slide 19.
The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate for the quarter was 0.45%. The criticized performing loan
rate for the quarter increased compared to both the prior year and linked quarters to 9.5% driven by downgrades
in our commercial real estate portfolio. The criticized nonperforming loan rate rose modestly from the prior-year
quarter to 0.9%.
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and how we're positioned for the future. It's not a surprise that
the pandemic shaped our 2020 results. For the full year, total company loan balances declined 5%. Annual
revenue was essentially flat, including $535 million in gains on our Snowflake investment. Non-interest expense
was down 3% with a decline in marketing and relatively flat operating expense. Provision for credit losses
increased by $4 billion. And earnings per share rebounded from negative territory early in the year to $5.18 for the
full year, down significantly from 2019.
Three key themes are evident in our 2020 results. The pandemic pressured top-line loan balances and revenue,
particularly in the first half of the year. On the bottom line, strikingly strong credit resulted in a return to positive
trajectory and record profitability in the second half of the year. And our long-standing strategic choices put us in a
strong position to respond to both the near-term challenges and the emerging opportunities.
Turning first to the near-term challenges. Domestic Card loan balances declined sharply as cautious consumers,
stimulus and widespread industry forbearance drove historically high payment rates and reduced demand. Lower
loan balances put pressure on revenue, efficiency and scale. The operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments
was 46%. It was 46.9%, excluding Snowflake gains.
The flip side of this top-line pressure was exceptionally strong consumer credit performance which drove two
consecutive quarters of record earnings in the second half of 2020. And strong second half earnings coupled with
a smaller balance sheet enabled us to increase our CET1 ratio to 13.7%.
Today, we've announced our intent to raise the quarterly dividend to its prior level of $0.40 per share subject to
board approval. And we also discussed our plan for up to $7.5 billion of share repurchases which our board has

already approved. Throughout 2020, we have been well served by the choices we made before the downturn
began.
Since our founding days, we've hardwired resilience into the choices we've made on credit, capital and liquidity
through good times and bad. As a result, we entered the downturn with strong and resilient credit trends, a
fortified balance sheet and deep experience in successfully navigating through prior periods of stress, including
the Great Recession.
Our investments to transform our technology and how we work and our efforts to drive the company to digital are
paying off. Our transformation is powering our response to the downturn and putting us in a strong position for
emerging opportunities as the pandemic plays out.
Pulling way up. Despite the pressures of the pandemic in the near term, nothing has changed about where we
think our businesses are headed or the long-term strategic opportunities that are being created as sweeping
digital change continues to transform banking.
As we manage through the near-term challenges, we also continue to focus on the things that create long-term
value when delivered and sustained over time, continuing to transform our technology from the ground up,
capitalizing on our transformation to drive innovation and growth, generating positive operating leverage and
improving efficiency and managing capital efficiently and effectively, including significant capital distribution.
And now, we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.
Please go ahead.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good afternoon, everybody. And Scott, congratulations. And Andrew, I think when you look back at Scott leaving
you with a $15.5 billion reserve is probably the best gift he could give you.
I wanted to talk a little bit about that. When we look versus day one, the reserve is now up $5 billion. I'm curious,
when we look at the current credit metrics, what do you think the scenarios would have to be to actually really
utilize that reserve over a lifetime?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Scott Blackley A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Hey, Rick. Thanks for your kind words and I appreciate both Rich and Jeff saying such nice things. It's been
honestly just a privilege to be at this company and it's certainly a tough place to leave. But let me turn to your
question.
In terms of the allowance, you're right that when you look at our coverage levels versus our current level of losses
and delinquencies, there's a big gap. And I would just point out that that is because right now our allowance is
built to absorb a very wide range of outcomes, which is sensible given kind of the circumstances that we are in at
the moment.
And so I think that the biggest driver of where the allowance might go and what might drive releases is frankly just
certainty. And narrowing down the range of possible outcomes, I think, could come from things like
macroeconomic factors like unemployment or pandemic-specific variables like broader rollouts of the vaccine,
reduced restrictions on people's movements and activities and things like that. So to me, it feels like that certainty
is more likely to happen over time versus a step function. So I think we'll see the allowance kind of play out in
measured ways over time.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2021
Thanks and congratulations, Scott. I guess I have a question on marketing expense and sort of the efficiency ratio
targets that you guys had outlined some time ago. When we look at the marketing expense, it seems like run rate
wise, we're back to 2019 levels on a quarterly basis. Can you guys actually exceed that going forward if there's
opportunity in the marketplace? And then as far as the efficiency ratio is concerned, how long before we can get
back to the 52% target that you had outlined, Rich?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
So Sanjay, good evening. We are not making specific guidance about marketing. As you know, while there are
certain things that are sort of fixed – mostly fixed about our marketing expenditures, a lot of it is based on real-
time assessment of prospects for resilient growth in the competitive marketplace. But let me just kind of pull up
and talk about our journey this year with respect to marketing. We pulled back early in the crisis but have since
increased marketing spend as you saw in Q4.
And as expected, the increase from Q3 was meaningfully higher than typical seasonal patterns. Right now, we
are seeing opportunities to invest. We continue to invest in our brand and our national banking strategy. And in
our Card business, we're leaning in where we see signs of strength. And we feel pretty good about our origination
opportunities and these are enhanced by our tech transformation as well. So we're keeping a very watchful eye
on the marketplace. But we do see opportunities and we're investing in them.
And with respect to efficiency, we still believe that we're on the path to achieve the efficiency targets that we had
talked about in prior years, driven by growth and digital productivity gains and really enabled by our tech
transformation. The pandemic has really impacted the timing of when we get there, particularly on revenue
growth. Now we feel good about our current revenue trajectory and we're still on the same efficiency journey. But
how the pandemic and the recession will play out remains uncertain and how the growth opportunity unfolds.
And also the sort of the great credit paradox, with the strength of credit also comes the high payment rates which,
certainly, it's a great thing for the overall financial performance of the company. But it's another thing that holds
back the growth. So we're leaning in to really – in the growth opportunities and we're on the same kind of –
heading to the same destinations we talked about before. But we're not giving guidance about the timing.

Let me add my congratulations, Scott. I wanted to ask about the buyback authorization. Is it reasonable to expect
that you'd seek to be as aggressive as possible in executing on it such that we could see you do the full amount
by the end of 2021, assuming a favorable backdrop where the Fed withdraws payout restrictions? And then within
that, how are you guys thinking about the regulatory capital impact of the CECL phase-ins for day 1 and 2 under
the CARES Act?

Yeah. Thanks for the question, Bill. Look, with respect to the share buyback program, I think the most important
thing I just want to underscore is that the $7.5 billion that was authorized by the board really underscores our
commitment to returning excess capital to the shareholders. And I think that we're certainly excited to start that
journey.
As we think about capital deployment, I think the hierarchy there is, first, capital to growth opportunities and then
share buybacks and dividends to follow. And I would just point out that in our past practice, you can see that we
manage share buybacks dynamically and we take into account market conditions, relative value, our holistic view
on where we are in our capital position.
In the first quarter, we'll be limited to $500 million. I mention that based on the Fed rules. After that, the pacing of
the share repurchase are really going to be guided by the factors I just talked about and by any regulatory
guidelines that we might see. I'll just say that we find our current valuation compelling. And with over $8 billion of
excess capital, we're really looking forward to getting started on the program.

John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks very much, guys, for taking my questions. Rich, you embarked on your digital banking transformation
several years ago. And at that point in time, it seemed the intent was to scale a traditional bank and using a digital
platform where you could do a lot more for your customers in a really simplified fashion over digital channels. But
digital banking, I think, has changed with the development of companies like SoFi and some of the fintech
companies kind of getting into, call it, thinner banking offerings with still digital wallets, nonetheless. I'm
wondering, does that – through the development of migration of digital banking overall, does that affect how you
see investments going forward to Capital One?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Everything that we see, John, I think reinforces our conviction about the strategy that we have and the journey
that we're on and the destination we're so energetically pursuing. So let's – and first of all, talk about the
pandemic. I don't think the pandemic changed much about the destination of banking, but it changed the timing of
that because it accelerated the digital journey. And one thing that's been so striking about banking products and
even banking products relative to credit card products is the stickiness and the inertia inherent in the customer
relationships that have existed sometimes for many decades.
And so one of the challenges for any digital bank is how do you go after that inertia and create something
compelling enough to cause people to switch. And so it's really nice being on, in a sense, the right side of history
because we can see the direction things go. What I'm struck by is the amount of acceleration that we've seen in
these inevitable trends this year. So, that's a good thing for us and we want to capitalize on that.
Now the other – along the way, not surprisingly, we've seen the rise of some very intriguing banking fintechs. And
we watch with great interest their strategies. In many cases, they have very nice digital customer experiences. In

some cases, they have created strategies that the banking industry didn't come up with. And we look with interest
in that and in many ways root for their success because it's all part of the same – their success is a manifestation
also of the accelerating change in customer behavior and the opportunity for digital banks. So we have a lot of
respect for some of the players. We're impressed by their innovation and we're energized by their success and
the success that we're having. And so as a result, we're leaning in – continuing to lean in and leaning in a little
harder on our own banking strategy.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Rich, in terms of the fintech discussion, I was wondering if you could comment on buy now, pay later. Did that
impact your business from a lending competition perspective or syndicated risk standpoint? And is it material
enough for us to keep an eye on from a risk perspective?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
So, buy now, pay later is a really interesting marketplace. It's, kind of ironic because the original buy now, pay
later product was the credit card. And so it's interesting to be a very established credit card player and feel a little
bit like the old guard as we're watching these innovations on buy now, pay later.
And I have a lot of respect for and I'm impressed by some of the things – the success of the point-of-sale lending
products. And point-of-sale lending has, of course, existed since really the beginning of lending itself. I think
what's striking here is the way that it exists, of course, in the e-commerce space, the way it's got shelf space right
there at the checkout page, some of the elegance of the digital technology, and interestingly, right now, financially
how this marketplace works because the striking thing to me is that right now, merchants are actually paying the
bill as opposed to consumers. And that tends to create a healthy marketplace. It tends to create better selection
dynamics. Then very often, you see in some of these short-term lending products, they tend to have very high
effective APRs and things that can sometimes lead to adverse selection.
So I think, to me, the thing that I'm most interested in watching from sort of the structure of that marketplace is
what happens to the, in a sense, the merchant discount with respect to those products as the competition from
lenders heats up in that space. So that's something that we'll have to watch. So I think there's a lot for Capital One
to learn in this marketplace and we're watching it closely. And we really with interest look to see how this
opportunity evolves.

Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good evening, guys. And Scott, congratulations. Rich, maybe just to dig in a little bit further on the efficiency.
I understand that you don't want to put a timeframe on it. However, if we look at the performance this year, we're
in the 46% range, still about 400 basis points from the 42% target that you had laid out. So could you maybe just
talk about the path to getting there from a financial perspective? Is it all about the return of card loan growth and
the revenue growth that comes with it or is there more from the digital transformation on the cost side? And if cost
is part of it, can you maybe just talk about what some of those drivers are and what the timing is in terms of us
getting there? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. So Ryan, if the efficiency – our journey and the success we had over a number of years really till the
pandemic sort of set things back a bit was driven to kind of mathematically, of course, by the two factors,
sustained revenue growth and the efficiencies that were coming particularly from transforming to a more digital
operating model. And I think the same things that drove our efficiency ratio down over the years are going to be
the same drivers going forward.
At the time that we gave the guidance on 42%, there were a lot of things coming together that – not only on the
efficiency side, things like getting out of data centers, things like the step-up that in the Walmart revenue-sharing
relationship. But very much we were looking at accelerating growth opportunities in our businesses, particularly
our consumer businesses. So the pandemic set that back. And so I would still say the biggest driver of the
efficiency gains that we will continue to work toward will be on the revenue side because we still continue to invest
in the digital opportunities that are in fact enabling the revenue growth.
And one thing that we've talked about is that we're now finished with our eighth year of our tech transformation.
And in many ways, this will be a lifelong transformation that we – this has been a starting at the bottom of the tech
stack journey. And over time, we've been working our way up the tech stack. And the more we get up the tech
stack, the more the opportunities are things that, well, actually the world can see, things that customers can
experience and things that can more directly enable growth. And that's why I mentioned on my comments about
marketing is that some of the marketing opportunities we see are, in fact, specifically enabled by our tech
transformation.
So therefore, while tech continues to create efficiency opportunities, it is also the basis for a number of our growth
opportunities. And we really want to take advantage of those. We're leaning in. And of course, it takes investment
to do that. So that's why I think revenue growth is – I would expect it to still be the bigger driver of our efficiency

journey on a net basis than on the cost side. But really the key is having a revenue growth that exceeds the
growth in expenses, of course.

Senior Vice President-Global Finance & Investor Relations, Capital One Financial Corp.
Next question please.

Operator: Take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great, thanks. So Rich, in the past, you've always – you've had a tendency to see the loan growth kind of lag the
marketing spend and account growth based upon credit lines. And you've talked about the need to kind of
incubate those accounts and increase their credit lines over time to get that balance and revenue growth. Can you
talk a little bit about where you sit in that now given the unusual nature, kind of where we are in the economic
cycle?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Right. Well, thank you, Moshe. With our strategy of relatively lower lines, we've often talked about how, in many
ways, the primary credit risk and the primary growth comes really on the line increase side more so than just the
originations themselves. And so what we have often done in times of stress or when there's extra caution – and
you will remember, Moshe, in the probably 18 months prior to this downturn, maybe two years, we were also
talking cautiously about lines because we said we are so long in the tooth on this economy.
And so that has been our strategy for managing risk is to try to hold the lines down, where we can continue to
lean into the origination side of the business and then open up the lines as we see more of the sun coming out
and more opportunities one customer at a time. So where we stand on that, we've been particularly tight on the
lines during this downturn. But I think that as we watch the pandemic play out, I think that we see opportunities
one customer at a time. But collectively pulling up on this, we do see important opportunities for increasing those
lines. And as we do that, that can put some momentum around the loan growth in a way that you don't just get
from originations which we're also leaning into.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
And maybe as a follow-up. When I would get the question in the past about what could cause rewards rates to
kind of moderate or come down, I had said an economic downturn. And obviously, we've got some form of an
economic downturn. And if anything, it's gone the other way. Any thoughts about kind of intensity of the rewards
competition and how to think about that into the next year or two?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yes. It's a really interesting question, Moshe, whether a downturn causes reward rates to go down or up. So the
case for down, in other words, for the competition to get less intense about that is that people are pulling back,
they're spending less and they're more concerned about riding through the downturn than they are about trying to
grow quite a bit.

Here's the flip side to that argument and the thing that I think is dominating in that particular tug of war. And that is
that what is most striking about the pullback, probably true in any downturn but especially in this one, is how much
pullback there has been in spending and what a pullback there has been in spending by heavy spenders. And I
think that's not just a point about heavy spenders. It's partly what heavy spenders spend their money on, which is
travel and entertainment on a disproportional basis relative to others and those are the sectors that have been
absolutely [ph] wackier (00:51:31).
So it's generally the case that the heavy spenders from a credit point of view, everything that we have seen would
be consistent that they perform well in a downturn. They just get more conservative in their spending. Travel
opportunities and things like that don't necessarily look so enticing and certainly the case in this downturn. And so
I think what happens is a response from players to lean into increasing inducements to generate the volumes that
people want to get. We have seen significant increases in upfront bonuses. We've seen increases in reward
levels. And I think that's probably a natural thing for us to expect in this particular environment even though
paradoxically it's associated with so much pullback.

Hi. Good evening. Can you hear me okay?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A

Yes. Hi, Betsy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, thanks. My question is just on how to think about the reserve levels and the reserve release from here. I
know the question's asked a little bit. But the reason I'm raising it is I think you said that your reserve today is
based on an unemployment rate of 8% at 2021. I know there's a lot more inputs than just that, but that 8% at
year-end 2021 is similar to last quarter's.
Yet at the same time, I know, Rich, you mentioned that every quarter that goes by with good credit is like a
reduction of peak if not a push-out. So how should I triangulate that? Should we be anticipating really more
aggressive reserve releases as the quarters come through that are not so bad or is there something else going on
in the reserving analysis that we should be thinking about?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Scott Blackley A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Hey, Betsy. Why don't I take that one? So look, I think that the – as I mentioned a couple of times, I think the
biggest consideration in our reserve right now is just the uncertainty and trying to make sure that we're capturing

all of the scenarios in thinking about that. And that is resulting in us having a really high level of qualitative
reserves on top of our modeled risk.
And so even in the current quarter where, you're right, our 2021 fourth quarter estimate of unemployment at
around 8% is consistent with where we were last quarter. During the full year, we're expecting lower levels of
unemployment than what we had forecasted or used in our allowance a quarter ago. And so that coupled with –
we saw the passage of stimulus were both factors that drove the release this quarter. But we still have – even
with the positive trends, we put on even more qualitative factors because it's just really hard to forecast where this
thing is going to go and how it may play out. And in the allowance, we continue to expect that we will see the very
low levels of credit come up and meet the high levels of unemployment that we see today.
And I really do believe that we will, over time, see that play out exactly how that relationship is going to normalize.
And if it doesn't normalize, then we're going to have allowance releases and they're going to come in over time.
But until we start to see kind of more evidence that that relationship is going to stay kind of at the levels where it
is, I would expect that we're going to continue to reserve against a variety of downside scenarios.

Rich, a question just on the tech investments and the – I don't know if you can quantify at all for us, maybe for
Scott, the amount that you're spending on technology versus several years ago, the growth in those investments.
And then maybe more importantly, what do you feel differentiates you the most from other banks or fintechs with
the changes, the upgrades in the technology and what's on the roadmap for further upgrades.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Okay. Bob, we don't break out our tech investments. But Capital One, I think, relative to banks our size invest
quite a bit more in technology than my sense is of what other banks our size invest in. By the way, our primary
competitive set is the big national banks and they have gigantic tech budgets. So we don't – we certainly know
also what we're up against.
But let me just talk about again – so philosophically what we've done. Look, I think when most banks – or I think
companies in general, when they're looking – everybody knows they've got to invest more in technology. And

even as recently as this quarter, so many companies said they're increasing their technology spend. And I almost
can't imagine companies not feeling the need to do that as they face an accelerating digital revolution. The thing
that's very common that companies do is they make their biggest investments at the top of the tech stack;
meaning the things that are closest to the consumer, investing in apps, investing in experiences for customers or
associates or things that can more directly and immediately manifest in improvements and it's a very natural thing
to do.
Capital One has taken the unlikely journey, a little bit the road less traveled by to have our investment primarily at
the bottom of the tech stack. So we're talking down at core systems and data and addressing vendor products
and their role in this thing, bringing lots of things inhouse, bringing a lot of engineering inhouse. And it's been a
journey that – and you know this, Bob, and other investors on this call know that they would often say I know
you're investing a lot. You're talking about it, but I can't see it. Because the problem is if you were to improve one
system in the core systems, it doesn't really manifest itself in something that the outside world can see. And this is
really the essence of the challenge that we and our investors who have patiently owned our stock of this journey
that we're going through.
What we so deeply believed at the outset of this journey and absolutely believe now that in order to compete with
the tech companies, in order to be a modern company and be able to go where banking is going to go is one
really needs a modern tech stack. And that's a hard thing for a startup bank to build. It's a really hard thing for a
legacy company to build. Now I think it was a little easier for Capital One only that we were in a sense an original
fintech three decades ago and so maybe don't have as much legacy as a lot of companies do. But it's still been a
very significant journey.
But I think when you say how do we compare ourselves with other companies, I think other companies have – I
think there's a lot of good things other companies that go and they are doing. They have really nice apps for their
customers and everything else. But I think more and more Capital One is built like a tech company and like some
of the leading tech companies that are changing the world. And I think it was a little bit of a shock to some folks
when one day we said, by the way, we're getting entirely out of data centers and into the cloud. And that's the
kind of thing that could only come as a product of many years of this. And it's not an accident that almost no big
enterprise legacy companies have in fact made that journey.
Now where does – but what it puts us in a position to do is to drive for opportunities and act more and more like a
tech company and be able to be more dynamic, faster to the markets, offer better products, a better customer
experience. And that gives us the opportunity to transform how we work, really how a bank works on the inside
from risk management, fraud, credit, compliance, operational execution. It enables us to build our national bank
and lean into that. It enables us to win some partnerships that – in head-to-head competition, I feel that we won
by virtue of some of the tech capabilities we had. It enables us to achieve better economics and not so much in
saving on – well, partly tech on tech costs like massive vendor costs that we can save. But at the same time,
we're investing a lot in tech so that the big net-net savings is not so much the tech costs as it is the opportunity to
reduce analog costs over time.
So that's kind of a long answer to your question. But when we look out and said, over time, we're going to want to
do that or we're going to do this thing over there or we're going to do that thing over there; in each case, we saw a
shared path of investment and transformation that we would need to do. And we're well down that path. We are
not done. In many ways, it's a lifelong journey. But I think our opportunities are increasing as we get farther down
this path.
