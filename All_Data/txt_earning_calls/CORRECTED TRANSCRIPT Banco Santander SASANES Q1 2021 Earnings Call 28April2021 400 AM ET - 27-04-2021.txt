Good morning to everyone. Thank you for making the time to attend to this conference call.
So, I should say that we have had a good performance in the first quarter. We have delivered growth in the
quarter. Net operating income, the pre-provision profit increased 15% on the back of revenues on growing 8%

and cost being flat in constant euros. This was driven by greater volumes, repricing deposits and the strong cost
control.
In this environment naturally in the middle of the pandemia, the digital adoption keep accelerating. Now, more
than 50% of our sales were made through digital channels compared with the 41% in Q1 2020. Compared with
the first quarter of 2020, revenue was higher. Efficiency improved a lot, mainly driven by Europe, and the cost of
credit also improved notably to 108 basis points. Loan-loss reserves stood at €24 billion, while non-performing
loan coverage of 74%. We have barely used the provisions overlay that we made last year. As a result, underlying
attributable profit reached €2.1 billion and underlying return on tangible equity stood at 13%.
In addition, we recorded expected restructuring charge for the whole year, for the whole 2021, €530 million net of
taxes, resulting in an attributable profit of €1.6 billion. The core equity Tier 1 ratios was 12.3% with an organic
generation in the quarter strong, organic generation on the quarter of 28 basis points, including 15 basis points
that we accrue to remunerate the shareholders, equivalent to 40% of Q1 2021 underlying profit. The bank is
accruing through the year or its intention to accrue it through the year the proportional amount of 40% to
remuneration of holders once the supervisors allow to do so.
The tangible net asset value per share grew 2% quarter-on-quarter. And while it's true that we still live in an
environment with significant uncertainties going forward, particularly those related with the vaccination process
and when the economy is going to go back to normal. On top of this and you already know, we announced our
intention to make a cash offer to repurchase our outstanding shares in Santander Mexico ,around 8% of the stake
in the company. This transaction is expected to be completed in the second or third quarter of this year.
So, if we look at the quarter, I should say that we've been living in an environment in which we have had still
expansionary fiscal and monetary policy with very low rates, although we should say that we start to see some
changes in the quarter. Brazil in our footprint are ready to raise rates in the first Q. But in general, we still have
very good or very low rates across the board. In relation with the – on the social front, lockdowns and restrictive
measures with different intensity in different countries and different time, but this has affected significantly
particularly household and individuals and consumer activity in the countries in which we operate.
On the other hand, state guarantee programs had a negative impact on the revenue also, even if it expect to
benefit the cost of credit. So, we have different speeds in the vaccination that, well, is producing different
outcomes among major economies. We are seeing already a significant rebound in the activity in the US. UK has
had significant volume levels and in the EU, we are starting to see some rebound starting back in March and
accelerating a bit in Brazil – sorry, in April.
Going to the group performance, I should say starting with the income statement, [ph] share rates (00:05:20), and
you have two columns there in the presentation, had a strong negative impact year-on-year, [ph] 12 (00:05:27)
percentage points in revenue and 8 percentage points in costs. Excluding then, revenue grew driven by all the
P&L lines. We continue to deliver an excellent cost performance in all the regions and we are doing especially
well in Europe. As a result, net operating income, as I mentioned before, grew 15% year-on-year. In addition,
lower loan-loss provisions compared with previous quarters and lower cost of credit, which I will describe later in
more detail. All in all, the first quarter underlying attributable profit reached what I already mentioned, €2.1 billion.
Finally, we recorded €330 million (sic) [€530 million] (00:06:08) expected restructuring charges for the year as a
whole, mainly in UK around €300 million, Portugal around €160 million, and Corporate Centre and others around
the remaining €70 million. Following this, Q1 attributable profit stood at €1.6 billion.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
Overall, all income statement lines performed well, supported as can be seen in the slide by our diversification.
[ph] However (00:06:37), geographies showed virtually the same weight, I mean the regions, and recorded a
strong profit increase. Of note, probably was the US with equity net profit of €616 million in the quarter. Digital
Consumer bank, which contributes to 11% of the group's underlying profit, also increased its profit significantly.
That is also the case for our global business as CIB had an excellent quarter with a result above €700 million
profit.
If we look at the trends in the P&L, we see revenues going up 3% quarter-on-quarter due to the strong
performance in CIB on the back of our strong activity with our corporate customers and the continued recovery in
net fee income, 4%, that came mainly from CIB and other activities because as I said before, the activity with
[indiscernible] (00:07:37) in the quarter due to the lockdowns.
Costs were down 3%, mainly driven by falls in North and South America, as the fourth quarter usually affected by
seasonal factors. As the result, net operating income increased 8% quarter-on-quarter, loan-loss provisions
plummeted by 25%, with broad-based fall across regions and most markets. Digital Consumer Bank also
recorded sharp falls. Finally, underlying profit exceeded €2 billion, notably higher than in the previous quarters.
[ph] I (00:08:12) focus more in the NII. I should say that while NII grew 5%, it's a result of higher volumes, plus 2%
in loans, plus 8% in deposits, the cost of deposits management that I mentioned before, positive impact from the
TLTRO, and well, it's one of the highest figures in the last couple of quarters. Moreover, it's worth recalling that
the first quarter has always some seasonality compared with the Q4.
As for year-on-year performance by country, I should remark the good performance in the UK, plus 24%, on the
back of higher customer balances, deposit repricing actions that offset – were partially offset by lower asset
yields. Spain, plus 10%, driven by higher volumes and TLTRO; Brazil, plus 6%, due to greater volumes that offset
lower interest rates. The US remained flat despite interest rate cuts. On the other hand, Mexico fell 6% due to
lower interest rates and lower portfolio volumes impacted by the pandemic and having a relatively cautious
approach to the credit risk.
When you go to net fee income, well, continued to be affected particularly on the households by the lockdowns in
most countries and seasonality as of the year in Brazil. Despite this environment, the [ph] opportunity (00:09:48)
in net fee income quarter after quarter from the loss of Q2 2020 allow us to recover Q1 2020 pre-pandemic levels.
And from here, we expect to start to grow if the pandemia behaves as we are expecting on the back of better
activity on the consumer household side of the business.
Our strategy has remained focus on growing loyal customers and higher value-added services and products.
These were reflected in the positive performance in CIB, Insurance, Wealth Management, and other business.
That – in total, they account for 50% of the group total fee income. Cards and transactional fees were dampened
by the pandemic and the UK reflected the impact from regulatory changes to overdraft since April 2020. By
region, North America grew 7% with rises both in US and Mexico; South America, 2%, with growth recorded in
Chile and Argentina, while Brazil start to recover. And Europe minus 4%, with generalized declines, except
Poland, due to lower activity on the household side that I've been commenting across the presentation.
On the cost side, well, very positive performance. So, we see Europe costs falling 4% and North America,
although they grow 2.8%, inflation, as you know, in Mexico is relatively high. And South America is performing
extremely well when you see in real terms. Our efficiency improved a lot at the group level. Now, it stays at 45%,
slightly below 45%. And I want to remark productivity gains, significant productivity gains in Europe where
cost/income ratio stays now at 50%, when last year this period, we were close to 60%.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
We are building a new operating model across the group that will enable us to accelerate our transformation and
further increasing productivity and remain one of the most efficient global banks in the world.
Going to credit quality. So, we have here the NPLs basically flat with improved cost of credit to 108 basis points,
driven by lower loan-loss provisions in most countries particularly in the US, Brazil, UK and also in Spain.
Looking at the three-month annualized provision, the cost of credit in the quarter was 84 basis points, that, well, in
the first Q of 2020 was almost double due to the provision overlay we took at this time. Loan-loss reserve stood at
€24 billion, while nonperforming loans coverage at 74%. As I said, the overlays still in the balance sheet that we
did last year is mainly in the balance sheet.
In summary, amid existing uncertainties especially in Europe, we see areas that are performing better than
expected such as the US. Looking forward, we also expect an improvement in individuals. We are seeing
consistent trends on the individual's household credit quality and we are somewhat more prudent about
corporates, in particular the SMEs that is going to depend very much on the recovery of the economy that we
expect to start in second, third, fourth – second and third mainly quarters of this year.
All this enabled the group [ph] cost upgrade (00:13:27) to perform better than expected and while this is more
moving towards our average cost across the cycle. While this strong operating performance translate into the ratio
of the return on equities – in the return on tangible equity in the quarter, 13% EPS growing nicely and tangible net
asset value that should reflect before they translate the good results, the good consistent, I will say, sustainable
results towards the ratios, the main financial ratios.
On capital, I already comment on the strong organic generation, 28 basis points in the quarter due to the net
effect of the 43 basis points increase from profit and risk-weighted asset management and the negative impact
from the shareholder remuneration of 15 basis points. This positive performance was offset by regulatory impact.
6 basis points is the IFRS 9 phaseout, and markets impacts on the IFRS portfolio. And full-year 2021 expect that
restructuring charges of 10 basis points that we're bringing forward to the first quarter.
So, now, we hand it to the CFO, José García Cantera that he's going to elaborate about the different areas of the
group.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José Antonio, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by [audio gap] (00:14:53-00:14:58) our global
scale, our customer focus and our diversification really helped once again our business and profit growth in the
quarter.
In Europe, we are executing our business transformation to accelerate growth through a more efficient operating
model that should allow us to progress towards our medium-term return on tangible equity target of 10% to 12%.
In the first quarter, it was 8%. Loans grew 2% and customers 7% with positive trends since the beginning of the
year in all markets. Revenue growth was 13% versus the first quarter of last year with strong cost control and
efficiency improvements. In addition, we had lower cost of risk at 51 basis points in the quarter.
In North America, sharp increase in deposits in both the US and Mexico, while loans fell due to the negative
economic impact from the pandemic, and more importantly, from the disposals of Puerto Rico and Bluestem.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
Underlying attributable profit was up strongly year-on-year driven by good net operating income and lower
provisions in the US. Return on tangible equity was 14%, 22% if we adjust for the excess capital in the US.
In South America, double-digit growth in both loans and deposits. Net operating income and profits were up
driven by a strong revenue growth and lower loan-loss provisions in most markets. Return on tangible equity rose
to 19%. Our Digital Consumer Bank had a 12% return on tangible equity and we saw a significant pickup in
activity in March. So, in summary, we've delivered robust performance in all regions in the quarter with a strong
business generation, positive trends in all lines of the P&L.
Moving to the countries starting with Spain. Our strategy remains focused on Santander One, where customer
migration is advancing according to plan. In activity, we saw positive commercial trends in individuals, notably in
residential mortgages that were up 17% year-on-year and consumer finance. However, loans fell slightly in the
quarter, mainly driven by wholesale banking, in line with global corporate deleveraging. On a year-on-year basis,
growth was 3% due to SMEs and corporates. Customer funds were 10% higher year-on-year, and of note here,
mutual funds that were up 23%.
In terms of results, underlying profit amounted to €243 million, almost three times higher than last year. We have
resilient total income, growing 10% in NII although, although this was negatively affected by lower fee income
from reduced economic activity from the pandemic. Quarter-on-quarter, NII was negatively affected by lower day
count, lower ALCO portfolio, and reduced volumes. We continued with the transformation of our distribution model
which enable us to grow the net operating income 9%. Loan-loss provisions down 29% and cost of risk improving
relative to the previous quarter. Going forward and despite the uncertainty that still remains in the quarter, we
expect NNI – NII growing at mid-single digits and the cost of risk below 2020, while operating costs should
perform as expected.
In the UK, we had a very positive quarter based on volume growth, lower cost of deposits and efficiency
improvements. In volumes, continued year-on-year growth in lending driven by mortgages and SMEs, and
customer funds were also up, boosted by Retail Banking deposits and mutual funds. Profits were 6% higher year-
on-year. Here, total income increased 12%. Of note was again net interest income, up 24%, mainly from deposit
repricing actions as well as higher customer balances especially in mortgages. Fee income was lower due to
regulatory charges affecting overdrafts.
Cost decreased, reflecting progress on our transformation program, and cost of credit was at 21 basis points in
the quarter. In 2021, we expect to be – to grow net interest income close to double digits, benefiting from new
business pricing dynamics and lower funding costs. The 1I2I3 account latest changes introduced in April will drive
additional improvements in our Q2 NII. We remain confident on being able to reduce the cost base by mid-single
digits in 2021 and we are not seeing any signs of asset quality deterioration in the UK.
If we move to Brazil, which had an excellent performance at the beginning of the year both in terms of volumes
and results, we saw commercial activity recovering pre-COVID levels. And we took advantage of that, increasing
our market share in lending. We hit the highest number of mortgage sales in the first quarter, and in auto, we
remain the leader in individuals and we increased our current account customer base. All the above was reflected
in greater volumes. Loans grew 13% year-on-year, mainly in individuals and government-backed SMEs, while
customer funds rose 12%.
In terms of results, profit was up 47% year-on-year and return on tangible equity increased to 21%. Total income
was backed by very strong NII and higher gains from financial transactions. We have higher productivity and a
strong expense management which enabled costs to drop 3% in real terms and reached record efficiency levels.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
Loan-loss provisions decreased strongly, with a very positive cost credit – cost of credit performance which fell to
3.8% if we look at 12 months, [ph] 3% (00:21:16) in the first quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter, profit's up
3%, again driven by strong NII and cost reduction which offset lower fee income, which is affected by insurance
seasonality.
If we look at 2021, we expect loans to grow faster than the market while customer revenue should increase
moderately and costs, maintain a good trend. And we would expect the cost of risk to be lower than last year and
in no scenario higher than 4%.
Moving to the US where we believe that the work that we have conducted over the last few years is showing in
these numbers, so beyond the improved macro conditions that obviously is helping, we believe that the work
again that we've done in the last few years is helping our performance in the US. Volumes was impacted by the
divestiture of Bluestem and Puerto Rico that I referred to before. Excluding these perimeter changes, loans were
up 1% year-on-year, with auto originations increasing 24%. Also deposits continue to perform very strongly.
We had very good and positive P&L performance, with underlying profit of €616 million, the highest of any country
in the first quarter. Net operating income increased 13% off the bank (sic) [back] (00:22:43) of strong NII from a
strong lease income, capital markets fee income and expense management. Excluding the disposals impact, net
operating income was up 19%. On top of that, loan-loss provisions decreased 81%.
We've made significant regulatory progress as the Fed terminated its 2017 Written Agreement with SHUSA, and
the OCC upgraded Santander Bank's Community Reinvestment Act rating to Outstanding. In Private Banking, BSI
announced its transaction to acquire $4.3 billion in customer assets and liabilities from Crédit Agricole, improving
our competitive position in this highly profitable market. For 2021, we would expect these trends to continue all
throughout the P&L and maintain a positive performance in asset quality.
We move to Mexico. We continue to invest in digital channels, and that is strengthening our value proposition with
new products and services. Year-on-year volume performance reflects the normalization of the corporate portfolio
following the uptick at the beginning of the pandemic. Profit was down year-on-year, impacted by NII pressure
due to lower rates and volumes.
Total income was down, again, NII was pressured, but this was more than offset by – which more than
compensated – fee income and gains on financial transactions. Costs were slightly up due to higher technology
investments, but in real terms, costs were down 3%. Loan-loss provisions dropped 7% despite some charges
recording – recorded for certain customer – corporate customers.
When we look at 2021, we would expect to see flattish NNI – NII while net fee income is expected to grow,
supported by credit cards, insurance funds and Investment Banking. Cost of credit should start to improve in the
coming quarters, with non-performing loans around 3% by year-end.
Moving to our Digital Consumer Bank, remember we created this as the leading digital consumer finance bank in
Europe, combining the scale and leadership of Santander Consumer Finance and Openbank's digital capabilities.
As a result of the health crisis, new lending fell 3% year-on-year especially in January and February. But as I said
before, we saw strong recovery in the month of March.
In results, underlying profit was €291 million, 25% higher year-on-year. Total income increased slightly compared
to 2020. NII was down mainly due to lower outstanding balances in Spain and interest rate limitations in Poland,

which were offset by higher income from operational leasing activity following the acquisition of Sixt Leasing
Germany in 2020.
Cost increased 1% mainly due to digital investments in technology in Openbank. Excluding this – the acquisition
of Sixt in Germany, cost fell 4% year-on-year. We had a strong reduction in loan-loss provisions, with quite a
strong credit quality performance. Cost of risk was at 0.69% in the quarter. For the coming quarters, we expect a
strong cyclical growth in Consumer Finance after one year of the pandemic, with a gradual recovery of volumes
and a solid credit quality across the European customer footprint.
Moving quickly to the global businesses, SCIB, Santander Consumer – sorry, Corporate & Investment Bank (sic)
[Banking] (00:26:20) deliver a very excellent quarter. We are – held – we held leading positions in the rankings of
structured finance, DCM and ECM. Outstanding results in the quarter which hit a record high. Revenue was up
44% year-on-year driven by customer-related activities; costs, 8% higher, but the efficiency ratio improved to an
outstanding 31.8%. Although this quarter results are unlikely to be repeated in the coming quarters, we expect a
positive performance for 2021.
The Wealth Asset Management & Insurance (sic) [Wealth Management & Insurance] (00:26:54) business
continued to perform well in the quarter. Total asset – assets under management amounted to €370 billion, 2%
high – 2% – 12% higher year-on-year. For Insurance, fee income rose 5%. Total fee income generated accounted
for 31% of the group's total and grew 3% year-on-year. Looking ahead, we expect continued growth in line with
volumes in this business.
This is the first quarter in which we report PagoNxt so I'm going to just stop here for maybe a bit longer than for
the other countries. Payments, as you know, are the cornerstone of our strategy to grow and reinforce our
customer loyalty. Customer – Santander accepts more customers than any other bank, over – almost 150 million,
including 4 million SMEs of which more than 200,000 are international customers in Europe and Latin America.
PagoNxt comprises three different businesses. First, Merchant Solutions, Getnet is already one of the top three
acquirers in Latin America. As you know, it started in Brazil that is a highly competitive market, but the business is
growing. We are taking advantage of that, gaining market share, reaching 15% in December 2020 11.5% in 2019.
In the first quarter, we launched Getnet Chile providing differential features in the local market, generating strong
demand.
Getnet in Latin America already operates in Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Argentina, has 1.1 million active merchants,
and this figure is growing 14% year-on-year. Total payment volume was €22.5 billion in the first quarter, up 26%
year-on-year, and we would expect to achieve 20% to 30% growth in the medium term for these two metrics. This
year is an investment year for the company. We will generate – start generating revenues in Europe in the second
half of the year to this, and obviously we will rely on the newly acquired technology assets of Wirecard that have
been purchased at a good price, and we aim at unlocking their value quickly.
The second component of PagoNxt is Trade Solutions. As I said, we have 207,000 clients with international
activities in the last 12 months. They – let me focus on the two most representative businesses here. The first is
OneTrade, which is our global trade and international payments platform. It already connects our customers in
Brazil, Spain, UK, Chile, Portugal and Colombia, and we have over 4,000 active customers. We expect to double
the transaction volume yearly going forward here.
Ebury, which has a presence in 20 countries, offers financial solutions to simplify international trade. It has
already 15,000 customers, active clients, and we would expect its revenues to grow 30% to 40% a year in the
8

medium term. And the third component of PagoNxt is Consumer Solutions. Here, Superdigital, our platform to
address the financial needs of the underbanked population, is being rolled out across seven countries in Latin
America.
This provides obviously huge growth opportunities for us and we believe we can double business year-on-year.
To this sense, Superdigital in Brazil already have almost 600,000 active customers, with a transaction volume
growing 30% year-on-year.
And now let me finish with the Corporate Centre where we see results improve 49% year-on-year, mainly due to
the positive impact of income tax from the release carried out this year and the charges recorded in the first
quarter of 2020, and the positive trend in operating expenses which improved 7% compared to the first quarter of
last year, driven by ongoing streamlining and simplification measures.
On the other hand, net interest income was impacted by the increase in the liquidity buffer. We had lower trading
gains because of the positive hedging results recorded last year, and we had higher provisions. The net loan-
provision line includes a charge of €150 million gross or €105 million net, which has not been allocated to any
specific portfolio so far and it was billed due to the lack of visibility as to the timing, pace and strength of the
economic recovery.
And with this, I'll turn it over to José Antonio. Thank you.

Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José. I'm going elaborate just to finish, just give me one minute. On the back of the first quarter
results, I should say that, well, the results were solid, consistent and sustainable. Revenue grew 8%, equally
improved the efficiency. And as a result of this, I already said that net operating income grows – grew nicely.
So, we continue to build on our customer base. Digital customers keep growing, the loyal digital customers keep
growing, and our customer satisfaction, we are top three in the – in six markets in which we operate. We already
recorded the restructuring charge for the whole year and continue to focus on cost control and improving our
efficiency ratio. We also improved the cost of credit and – with an underlying profit of €2.1 billion. The core equity
Tier 1 ratio is above our target and the underlying return on equity rebound to 13% in the quarter.
Let me to – take a look forward for 2021, and I should say that we are increasingly constructive. Taking a look to
the business environment, we expect activity to increase as vaccination progresses, although at different speeds
depending on the vaccination progress in different countries. Amidst some remaining uncertainty, we see lower
cost of credit, with better performance in individuals than in corporate. We believe that the demand for individuals
and consumption will rebound, especially in countries with a faster vaccination rate. This would allow higher fee
income generation as activity increases.
Regarding the outlook for the main regions, in Europe, we expect high single-digit underlying return on tangible
equity on the back of strong household activity rebound, margin management, net fee income recovery and
savings plan execution. North America, underlying profit trends should be better than initially expected in the US,
as shown in – with Q1 excellent results. The auto business is well-positioned to benefit from strong demand for
vehicles, leveraging our deposit franchise in the US.
South America, amidst the challenging environment, we should deliver continued growth in Brazil, with an
underlying return on tangible equity projected around 20%. The Digital Consumer Bank, we expect a – we have

already seen some recovery of volumes toward normalization and solid credit quality, as seen in the US; potential
growth in digital retail banking across Europe, with operation in Spain, Portugal, Netherlands and Germany
through the Openbank; expect double-digit return on tangible equity in 2021 as seen in Q1.
As we progress through the year, we are more confident that we will deliver on our medium-term goals and we
remain very constructive on our target for 2021: Improve the efficiency ratio, reduce the cost of credit, and
increase – significant increase of our profitability.
Thank you very much. And now, we will remain at your disposal for the questions you may have.

Thank you, José Antonio. Thank you, José. Indeed, time now to jump to the Q&A session so please, operator, we
can proceed with the first question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [audio gap] (00:35:15) much. [Operator Instructions] And we already have a couple of questions, the
first one coming from Alvaro Serrano representing Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions for me. One, the first one is on growth. Look, it's
clear that provisions on the whole are much better, but beyond that it does look like the market – I mean, the
market – the multiple suggests that the market is not buying the growth outlook. And my questions on that, what
do you think is missing from consensus numbers?
Because beyond the currency, if I look at your medium-term targeted, it does look like Europe is the biggest
disconnect. And if I think about the Digital Consumer Bank, you – obviously, at the end of the year with the full-
year results, you were looking for – to double profits medium term. If I look at the cost/income ratio, that's more
than €1 billion delta in revenues and in your European operation, there's also delta there.
What's consensus not grasping there? Is there – are you that optimistic that you can grow consumer business
there? Is it purely Openbank? Are you going to do add-on acquisitions that we don't fully appreciate? And maybe
a comment in growth generally and, in particular, with the European SKU.
And the second question is on capital, you're [ph] €11.9 million (00:36:43) fully loaded. It looks like the capital
build is going to be better for the remainder of the year. Would you consider buying back last year's scrip as a way
to maybe sort of gain back some of the institutional investors that were disappointed last year? Thank you.

José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Alvaro. Thank you for your questions. Growth, a very general question. So you know that our
business, in many ID – ADS, and I mentioned in the medium, long term, is supposed to growth because we have
the vision that we have, and we are in the geographies we have, with plenty of growth in front of us. This is by
10

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
geographies in Latin America. This year probably, the visibility on this is poor. The massive depreciation of the
currencies in 2020 naturally affects the translation of the growth we have had. You see the numbers in Brazil, you
see the numbers in Mexico, and then you see the numbers in Chile, we are growing nicely even in the middle of
the pandemia. The translation into euros was not so good.
In the consumer side, that's where do think that we can grow, naturally, with the lockdowns, we are not growing.
What we are seeing already in March and April, these are rebound, these activities. And we expect, provided the
vaccination goes as expected, we expect to start to show significant growth. We can capture growth on the Digital
Consumer Bank. On the auto space, we – where we are market leader, we were not working in the leasing space,
we can start to grow there. And the Digital Consumer Bank offer us opportunities in the non-auto-related
consumer space that we are starting to take.
So those are the – on top of this, you have PagoNxt. José already elaborate on the growth prospects of PagoNxt
that we expect to capture in the coming years. So this is – we continue remarks, our growth outlook. Naturally, it's
difficult to talk about growth in the middle of an economic meltdown due to the pandemia, but you see our results.
The main difference, I should say, compared with what I've seen in the market is that we are growing revenues
and controlling costs.
And the main difference is our operating income is growing 15%, our – the P&L is not made out of the reduction in
provisions. Naturally, we have reduction in provisions, but we have top line growth, that we expect these to
rebound from now onwards due to the improvement in the economic activity.
The capital, second question, you said a specific question, we accrue, as you see in the quarter. Our intention is
to accrue 40% of the underlying profit to remunerate the shareholders. It can be a dividend, it can be buybacks,
okay? So, this depends. It's up to the board to take – they are for bid decision if we are allowed to do so, naturally,
by the regulator, but our intention is to continue with this accrual because within that, this is sustainable, and that's
our intention.

Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes. I wanted to ask about Spain. First, on the top line, NII falls 4.5% quarter-on-quarter beyond the 2% of the
day count. So, I wonder if you can update on your guidance. It seems to me that the mid-single-digit growth rate
might be a bit challenging, so if you can update on the trends in the quarter and the drivers for the coming
quarters?
And also in Spain, on the cost of risk, it remains high for another quarter, which makes sense because obviously
the Spanish market is underperforming other geographies, but – so if you can update on how do you see the
credit cycle in Spain and your cost of risk, when do you see then the normalization and at what levels? Thank
you.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Francisco. First question, about NII, well, revenue in general in Spain, particularly on NII, well,
our guidance remains the same. So, we expect to grow NII during the year around mid-single-digit. The quarter,
you mentioned already, the day count and – was some reduction in volumes and those two affected this. But for
the whole year, we remain confident that we reach the mid, the kind of mid-single-digit growth in NII.
And naturally, in fee income, we expect to make significant progress, starting probably – well, starting in the
second quarter and progressing along the third and fourth quarter of the year. So we remain constructive on our
outlook for revenues in Spain.
In the cost of risk, that is your second question, on the credit cycle, this is a very interesting question. As I
mentioned in the presentation, we are constructive on the credit quality on the households, individuals, consumer
space, where we are seeing good trends. The moratoria has expired and we are seeing good trend then so we
remain confident on this side of the business.
While in SMEs, particularly in those economies that are not – performing not so well on that due to the relative
specialization of these economies, we don't have – simply, we don't have enough visibility at this point. There are
several factors. Some of them seasonal, you know the tourist season, if this year is going to – how it's going to be,
the tourist season, strong uncertainty in relation with this and when the business is going to come back to normal.
The second question is the credit cycle, probably is the right question, when we're going to have visibility on this.
Probably, if you ask me as of today, I should say to you that we need at least, I don't know, two quarters of
normalization before we have a clear visibility of the damage of the pandemia in the SME space. Probably, it's –
well, it's my guess, or it's the best guess I have. So, a couple of quarters to see this, but make sure that we keep
updating you now.
Visibility is relatively poor because, well, there's a significant number of customers affected by the lockdowns in
the SME space, microbusiness and self-employed people although, as you know, we have a large portfolio
protected by state warranty schemes. This affect mainly in our portfolio in Spain, Portugal somehow, but the
largest portfolio is Spain.

Yes. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I just have two questions, one on cost performance. How do you
expect the €1 billion savings to perform now that you have [indiscernible] (00:44:28) Digital Consumer Bank? And
when should we start to see the benefits of the restructuring charges in Spain, particularly, and in the UK?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
Second one is on the cost of risk in the US, I mean, we have a very good performance of secondhand car indexes
that makes a lot of good performance of provisions, but I mean, what would be the normalized level of provisions
that you will expect out of the US going forward? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Ignacio. Thank you for the question. The whole issue of cost performance, the €1 billion
commitment in Europe and the restructuring charge, I mentioned the restructuring charge. We took all the
restructuring charges expected in – for Spain last year. I think it was the fourth quarter, José? It was the fourth
quarter last year. In this quarter, we are taking the one we expect for the UK, Portugal, I think it's more probably
like €20 million for Digital Consumer Bank and like €50 million for the Corporate Centre.
On the back of this, we expect Spain to be – the cost decreasing high single-digit; UK, mid-single-digit; and the
same can be applied, Portugal, and less so in Poland. And the Consumer Bank, the Consumer Bank is a different
story because these are growth. As I mentioned before to the question of Alvaro, it's a growth story and we're
going to have the two dimensions, one dimension in which we reorganize our business in Europe, and remember
that we have 15 banking licenses that we're going to reduce to – we're going to transform into branches and this
allow us to reduce costs.
On the other side, we want to grow the Retail Bank and the non-auto-related business in – to grow faster than
with the buy now pay later kind of new activities [ph] handling (00:46:29) the leasing in the auto activities. And
we're going to have two dimension. On one side, we're going to say costs due to reorganization; on the other
side, we're going to increase the business, and we're going to grow the business in these dimensions. So, the €1
billion will come mainly in the proportions of the cost we have. The majority will come from Spain, UK, two-thirds;
and the other 30% comes from the other – all other units.
The second question was the cost of risk in the US, the normalized level. I should say we have two effects in the
US. One is the cost of risk that naturally goes to the loan-loss provision. Remember that we are not releasing
provision in the US. We are still providing for the business. But it's true that the cost of risk is significantly lower on
the back of the fiscal stimulus that provide support to households, individuals along the US.
And on top of that, we have, what you already rightly mentioned, the used car prices that support – we have a
leasing – leases and we have residual value. And when we dispose the cars once the lease is expired, we are
making some gains out of this business. So, the two go in the same direction.
So having said that, and – we expect the cost of risk, the first part, on the back of the fiscal stimulus, to remain
well below the traditional standards, while the leases, the used car, for the time being, much more difficult to
forecast. It's probably relatively easy to forecast one quarter but much more difficult to forecast the long term.
But it's true that we are pricing the leases in a conservative way to try to protect when [ph] the bump (00:48:31) of
the used car prices happen, that for sure are – is going to happen. So those are the two engines. But for this year,
the business continued to show, for the whole year, I expect – I – we expect very good trends in the business.

Operator: Thank you. It is coming from Daragh Quinn representing KBW. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daragh Quinn Q
Analyst, KBW
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the presentation and taking my questions. I'd like to go back or stick with the
provision charge in the US, please, and specifically the consumer business, a loan-loss charge of just 300 basis
points this quarter versus a historical number of closer to 10%. Clearly, we've seen over the last few quarters that
that number has come down but I just kind of wonder, apart from this year and maybe the shorter term impacts of
the stimulus, what do you think is an appropriate medium-term outlook for the provision charge in the US
consumer business? That will be my first question.
And the second question, on Brazil and cost growth, I think historically, your guidance there has been to grow
cost below inflation. In the first quarter, we've actually seen a nominal reduction in costs. Is that just down to
specific trends in this quarter or is it a reflection of a greater focus on cost control in Brazil?
And sorry, if I may, just a final question on capital, a small amount of regulatory charges this quarter, maybe if you
could just remind us of what we could expect on that front for the rest of the year? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Daragh, for the questions. I pass to José the – to the CFO the question in relation with the capital. The
provisioning charge in US, as you rightly said, is low for the – this quarter and 300 basis points. We've been more
on the high single-digit, but this largely depends also on the mix. You know that – well, depends on what we'll
retain on the back – on the balance sheet.
Normally, we dispose a significant chunk of the prime business that we originate. Some of these goes to the
market, [ph] which you criticize (00:51:15), we dispose. Some of these goes to SBNA, to our commercial bank
that use the deposits to fund this business. And the – what remains the balance sheet, the mix is very important.
But provide that we had the same mix that in the past that was in the region of, if I remember well, I am not sure,
we had like €20 billion of subprime and another €20 billion of – between near prime and prime, the cost of risk
should be in the region of [ph] 7% and 8% (00:51:47).
This region has been – makes sense that, I don't know when, probably not this year, maybe next year, I don't
know. Difficult to forecast this with the economy of the US, is – well, is deemed to perform very well. On the back
of the infrastructure investment program, the fiscal stimulus, it's very difficult to say when this is going to back to
normal provide that we keep the same mix. That's still important, Daragh, because the difference in cost of risk
between the two business is very, very large.
The second question, if I remember, was Brazil costs, yeah? The general cost in Brazil. So in Brazil, productivity
is improving dramatically. Our digital sales are performing extremely, extremely well. And on the back of this, we
are able to increase significantly the productivity. And you've [ph] seen (00:52:45) we are keeping – is not the
same transformation that the one we are doing in Europe. It's not about closing brancheses and all these things.
It's, as a matter of fact, we are still opening some brancheses in areas in which we don't have presence.
It's true that we also closed some branches in areas that are more crowded, but in general, it's more internal
organization of the business and the capacity to increase digital sales and remote sales, remote sales from
specialized call centers that we incorporate in the last – six month ago, a new contact center in the south of the
country that is far cheaper than it is São Paulo for having this business, and is performing extremely well.

And we are optimistic that we can continue to design new ways to reach customers in a market that offer good
opportunities to grow. And we are capturing some of them. You see that we are reducing costs, then at the same
time, gaining significant share in the most interesting products in the country. It's not – Brazil is not and is not
going to be a cost story. It's going to be a growth – a revenue growth story, it's more than a cost story.
Having said that, we want to increase our productivity. In March, for example, we sold 630,000 cars in this month
with the economy being in the middle of a lockdown. And we're going to be focusing, continue to grow in the
country, naturally with cost control. Now, I'm handing back to José.

...expected regulatory charges in capital. The sum of some small charges could be between 5 to 10 basis points.
Then there are two – the two largest charges that we would expect this year come from the low default portfolios,
which is coming in the second quarter and that will be around 8 basis points. And then the new definition of
default, which is uncertain, when it will have to be taken and the amount that that will represent, but we believe it
will be, in any case, less than 10 basis points. So, more or less, we would expect to see 25 to 30 basis points of
charges from regulation in the three quarters this year.

Carlos Cobo Catena Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (Spain)
Hi. Thank you very much for the presentation and taking my questions. Two quick ones and then just a
clarification. First one, in the UK, I was expecting a – fairly a better performance in net interest income, maybe
same as the performance in Spain having probably in the low end of expectations, but in the – in particular, where
the business dynamics in terms of volumes from book spreads were more encouraging. Could you elaborate a
little bit on why the net interest income decline in the quarter? I understand there's a calendar effect, but are there
other drivers that you could elaborate there?
Second question on legacy assets in Spain. It's not you only, I think the whole sector is providing, only for the
pandemic, cost of risk with no much attention on legacy assets, and you still carry a high stock of non-performing
assets in Spain. I would like you to elaborate a little bit on how do you think about that portfolio? How do you plan
15


Banco Santander SA

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
to divest it? [ph] And if you don't, will demand (00:56:49) top-up in coverage to accelerate the exit from this
portfolio?
Also, on asset quality in Spain, if you could discuss how much of – well, Spain, and this is for the whole group.
How much of the restructure loans and payment holidays do you keep as performing in your stage 1 portfolio,
because this is just [ph] the fact for the factor in general (00:57:15)? I mean, if you maintain the bulk of the
potential [ph] problematic exposures are performing (00:57:20), obviously, the modeling and the provisioning
models will demand lower provisions. But when shall we have a clearer view on how much NPL information do
you provide for to compare with how much potential deterioration could be coming? I know it's a complex
question, but if you could elaborate a little bit on how much of the payment holidays is still list under performing
stage 1 portfolio, that would be very helpful. Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Carlos, for the questions. The first point was UK NII, I think José already elaborate on this. So,
we expect still the NIM to accelerate a bit in the second quarter as a result of – on the back of further cost, deposit
cost reduction, and having good activity on the volume side in mortgages make us positive on this. And for the
whole year, we should be north of 10% in NII growth in the UK. We guide you taking the last quarter in this
direction and we remain confident that this is going to be the case.
You elaborate – you made the question about NII that was also raised by [ph] Francisco (00:58:46) before. You
try to understand the first Q, the first Q as [ph] Francisco (00:58:52) said that, well, it's 2% mainly – 2% drop is
[ph] they can and another (00:58:56), and you see the loan book fell like 2% in the quarter and those are the – on
top of having less activity. Yeah, the activity, the new activity in the – the activity in the quarters with the lockdown
was somehow reduced and this activity partially, the fee income generated at the beginning of the origination
goes to NII and those are the factors from this.
When you refer to legacy assets, well, our provisioning policy and, well, we've been, I would say, in the quarter
conservative. Provisioning policy in Spain, the provision remains pretty high. The cost of risk, if I remember well,
is close to 100 basis points. Remember that before the pandemia, we were in 30 basis points, 35 basis points.
Now, we are 100 basis points. We are taking another provision for potential reasons due to the uncertainty and
poor visibility on the Corporate Centre. So, we think that we are providing, we have been prudent in our
provisioning in the P&L for the potential events that may come, including the legacy asset naturally that we take
into account in our provisioning policy naturally. It's not only about the scenarios. It's also about what we have in
the balance sheet in the situation in which they're at.
Restructuring loans, you referred to payment holidays. I don't know if I understood you well, the question. When a
customer asks for a payment holiday for a moratoria remains in the Stage 1, naturally. So, for the time in which
the company or the majority individuals stay in moratoria. Once the moratoria expire, some of these moratoria
were mandatory by the government, particularly this happened in Portugal, in UK and half and half in Spain. In
Spain, half was granted by the bank, half was mandatory by the government. The majority of these moratoria
expire. When the moratoria expire, if the customer start to make again normally remains in the Stage 1 naturally.
If the customer asked for another extension that maybe in some cases not – but we start to classify accordingly
and the customer doesn't pay goes to the stage 3. You know that this is not as straightforward as before.
And this is how do we classify and that's the reason why you are seeing [indiscernible] (01:01:30) since the
pandemia started, you are seeing the stage 2, particularly stage 2, as for stage 2 growing accordingly with the
behavior of these payment holidays. Having said that, while we – the majority of the moratoria already expired,
16


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2021
you have the numbers in the presentation, what remains in moratoria is basically the ones who were mandatory in
Portugal. That is by – I think speaking from memory is in September. And the ones in Spain that are [ph] inspiring
(01:02:02) around now because we're granted one year ago in April, May, June. And in this second quarter,
[indiscernible] (01:02:10) the majority and we classify accordingly the payment behavior showed by the customer.
So, I hope I answered your question.

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just two questions, please. Elaborate in a little bit more on
the NII in Spain and Europe. I just want to refresh the contribution from the TLTRO programs. And how do you
see the evolution during the year? This would be the first question.
Related to that, especially in Spain and the UK, I just would like to know a comment on the changes in
management that we have seen so far and the strategy with the new management teams, I guess it's not cost-
related. It should be more revenue-related. But just wanted to know if there's any strategic change in those areas
and those regions. And finally, on the restructuring charges, you mentioned that we're done for 2021. I just want
to know if there could be some moving on into 2022, given these recent changes in these specific regions that we
mentioned. Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Fernando, for the questions. Starting from the very last one, we do not expect on the back of
the cost the One Europe program additional restructuring charge. It's done for the €1 billion cost savings that we
announced. I don't know when was in October. That's all. This is related with the changes in management and the
strategy that you mentioned before. Well, when we announced the One Europe, the One Europe is – on the back
of One Santander is the intention to become more integrated in order to gain significant efficiencies operating
together. So, that means that in several products, you're seeing the news flow, you follow this, the news flow in
the organization in Europe is becoming an organization where the products are – some products, not all the
products, some products have [indiscernible] (01:04:53). There are people, executives that have European
responsibility, mortgages and cards, and in some other areas.
And there are also developments in the transformation on the utilization that are in Europe. The new app is going
to be the same in one year for all the group in Europe and this is – those are the – this transformation program,
having a new head of Europe make advisable to do the change that we announced today in order to create the
organization that fit for purpose in this regard. We have both Nathan as the CEO of UK and Rami as we
announced this morning. They remain in the group, doing different roles. But this is to accommodate the
European organization to transformation program that we announced and we are progressing well on this.

Yeah. Hi. Here is Sofie from JPMorgan. Just to follow up on the previous question. Unfortunately, I couldn't hear
what the TLTRO benefit is. So, if you could just repeat that.
And then my kind of first question would be last week, there were some headlines around Santander potentially
looking at lease plan. Could you just discuss kind of what your view is on M&A and disposals and has anything
changed here? And kind of how should we think about any potential strategic M&A, if you can just remind us what
your key ambitions here are?
And then, my second question would be if you could just talk a little bit about Brazil. What's your outlook in terms
of rate hikes in Brazil? Where do you expect interest rates to go reimbursed in? And how – if you could also
remind us of your rate sensitivity in Brazil and kind of how do you think about NII progression in Brazil. Thank you.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. M&A activity, strategic M&A activity, well, we have nothing to add. Yeah. So, we are not – we are focused
100% in organic growth. We are not looking at any kind of deal that can [indiscernible] (01:08:23) to take. Well, at
least naturally, we made the offer, the tender offer in Mexico but those are small. Nothing that changed the profile
of the group.
Brazil, so it's true that the rates – the market expect that the rates keep going up. They already raised the rates by
75 basis points. The market is more to come and I agree that there's more to come on the back of relatively high

inflation and these affect the business in a way that – you have the figures, José, how much is the sensitivity to
higher rates in Brazil?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Brazil is very much balanced. So, it's slightly negative. 100 basis points parallel shift in the interest rate curve is
less than €100 million, so it's very much balanced. For the group as a whole, again, a parallel shift upwards of 100
basis points is a positive €1.75 billion.

Hi there. Thank you very much. Two questions for me, one on capital and one on asset quality. On capital and
specifically on capital requirements, how do you see the impact of the upcoming stress test on Santander? You've
previously mentioned that you expect the stress test to be harsher than previous ones, but do you have any
visibility at this stage on the contours of the outcome? And then, on asset quality, can you give us maybe the
moving parts of the overlay provisions you've made last year and how much of these provisions remain
unutilized? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
So, the first question, capital stress test, we are [indiscernible] (01:10:14) it's too early to provide you with any
numbers. We send the first numbers. As you know, we tend to perform very well on the stress test on the back of
our diversification, yeah, so knowing that the scenario is harsh. But, well, I remain confident that we're going to
continue to perform very well on the stress test, but it's too early to call, yeah? So, the discussion with regulator,
about to start, and we'll see the different interpretations they have in relation with our numbers. The second, asset
quality, the overlay I said in the presentation, [ph] the good value used (01:10:56) the overlay, I think on the €1.6
billion, probably we used €100 million, maybe.

€150 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A

€150 million he's telling me. So, the majority remain on the books. And, well, I gave you already my outlook for the
credit quality. The majority of this is related with consumer and consumer is evolving very well and, well, we'll see.
This is too early to call and significant uncertainties remain and we prefer to be prudent at this stage and
remaining with the capacity to offset potential future losses just in case something goes wrong with the

vaccination and the recovery that everybody expect, including ourselves, but the situation advise you to be
prudent. Yeah.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jernej Omahen representing Goldman Sachs. Please
proceed.

Jernej Omahen Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
Okay. Good morning from my side as well. I'd like to ask a couple of questions and they're all related to the capital
return prospects. So, the first question, you gave us an update at the end of the fourth quarter on your interaction
with the SSM on the dividends and the prospect of restrictions being lifted. I guess we're three months closer now
to the 30th of September. And I was just wondering if there's anything more that you can share or perhaps give us
insights as to the discussion with the relevant authorities on this topic? Do you feel more, less confident, or is the
situation exactly the same as it was at the end of the year?
And the second question I would like to ask is when you think about risk-weighted asset growth for this year and
then perhaps further out, what kind of number do you think is realistic for the group?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
The capital return, if we have additional information [ph] like (01:13:14) the one we share with you at the end of
the last year. In reality, we haven't got any additional information other than the one that was made public at some
point was the interpretation of the market. The SSM was more constructive and they are pointing towards the
provisioning level, levels vis-à-vis of the potential – the uncertainties surrounding the economic activity, that what
we have is one quarter of more visibility, as I said in the presentation, more constructive on the consumer
individual side but I remain with significant uncertainties on the SMEs and corporate books. And for that reason, I
think I repeat a couple of times we keep providing and not releasing provisions in the quarter. Yeah. So, that is
what I can share with you in this regard.
In relation with risk-weighted asset growth, I do not expect a lot of growth on the back of the market remains in
very good shape to release capital through securitizations. And the implicit cost of equity at which you can release
capital, at least up to today, is well below the cost of capital. At least this is clear on the more granular type of
portfolios. If that remains, our risk-weighted asset grow is going to be somehow limited and probably José can
give you a number on the back of being pretty active in securitizations that we've been doing in the last, I don't
know, couple of quarters and we always look at the market in this direction. We can release capital significantly
below the cost of capital we do, and the market now is in good shape. For that reason, I do not expect significant
growth in risk-weighted asset. José, do you want to say some?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
No. This year, like José Antonio is saying, we don't see risk-weighted asset growth and we are working to
compensate the regulatory charges that we discussed earlier on. Looking forward, we think we can on – over the
20

long term, we can have risk – obviously, this is excluding regulatory changes. We think we could sustain, more or
less, a 3%, 4% risk-weighted asset growth over time.

Thanks, Jernej. I'm afraid, we are running out of time, but we have time for one last question, please. So, let's
proceed with the last question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: All right. It is coming from Ignacio Cerezo. Ignacio's representing UBS. Your line is now open. Please
proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Cerezo Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
Yeah. Hello. Good morning. Most of the questions have been answered, but I have two on capital left. If you have
any view or color on the impact of the US fiscal reform, I'm thinking of DTAs in the country, if any?
And then the second one, I've seen a higher charge loan credit impairment in Poland, which I think is related to
the FX mortgages. How much more is coming do you think actually throughout the year and now? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
To tell out the fiscal reform, you can do the math. So, the main information is the rate, the final rate. And naturally,
if this increase is going to have an impact, not very significant, I don't have very specific number because I don't
have. [ph] We try typically, should expect (01:17:11). I don't know if this is already known or not. People
[indiscernible] (01:17:16).
The high charge in Poland, you were right, absolutely right, it's due to the Swiss francs. Our provisions there stay
around €200 million. So, well, as you know, this is subject to the supreme court ruling or decision that is going to
come, if I am well-informed, next month but has been delayed already twice and is expected to come in 15 days,
José, or something like that. Yeah. 15th of May is expected and, well, the provisions you mentioned were made
on the back of this.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Unverified Participant
Okay. We need to [indiscernible] (01:17:59) here, everyone. So, thanks very much for attending this call.
Obviously, the entire IR team is at your disposal for any follow-up. So thanks and keep safe.
