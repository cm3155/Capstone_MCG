Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
John R. Ciulla
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Emlen. Good morning, and welcome to Webster Financial Corporation's first quarter 2024 earnings call.
We appreciate you joining us this morning.
I'll provide remarks on our high-level results and operations before turning it over to Glenn to cover our financial
results in greater detail. We're off to a solid start this year, having achieved a number of significant
accomplishments, both strategically and financially. I first want to provide some color around initiatives that
solidify Webster's commitment to our clients, communities and colleagues as these have been and continue to be
core to our company values.
In the fourth quarter, Webster launched the You're Home program, a Special Purpose Credit Program offering
down payment assistance and flexible credit requirements to help expand homeownership opportunities for low-
to-moderate income first-time homebuyers. The You're Home program is the most recent component of our broad
Community Investment Strategy, a multiyear commitment to expanding access to capital, providing loans,
investments, technical assistance and financial services to individuals and small businesses in LMI
neighborhoods.
We're also launching four new Finance Labs in the coming weeks. In partnership with local nonprofits, the
Webster Finance Labs initiative provides technology and programming to create financial empowerment
opportunities for young people. By the end of this year, we will have deployed over $1.7 million into nine Labs
under this initiative. Our colleagues share this commitment to service. Last year, Webster volunteers gave nearly
17,000 hours of their time to nearly 500 community organizations across our footprint. These are just a few
examples of how Webster and our colleagues demonstrate our commitment to our values and our communities.
Turning to our financial performance on slide 2. On an adjusted basis for the quarter, we generated a return on
average assets of 1.26% and a return on tangible common equity of 17.9%. Our adjusted EPS was $1.35. We are
pleased to grow client deposits by $1.8 billion and use those funds to redeem brokered deposits. Amidst a
challenging growth environment for the industry, we grew loans at 0.7% or 1.2% when adjusting for the transfer of
$240 million of loans to held for sale.
Our $1.6 billion in funded loan originations this quarter were driven by high-quality C&I, CRE categories, including
fund banking and public sector finance and CRE and property types with solid operating dynamics. Our efficiency
ratio was 45%, in line with the low to mid-40s range we expect to operate in for the year.
Our interest income performance was softer than originally anticipated as a number of factors led to lower-than-
expected loan yields, and we saw our deposits continue to reprice higher, albeit at a moderated rate. Despite
these dynamics, we still anticipate that NII for the full year will be in the lower range of the guidance we provided
in January, assuming loan demand and credit quality of that loan demand cooperate.
Structurally and longer term, we should continue to generate returns near the top of our peer group given the
strategic advantage provided by our funding profile and business mix and the operating flexibility we have created
in terms of our liquidity and capital positions. We anticipate the ability to generate a return on assets in the range
of 1.3% and a return on tangible common equity in excess of 18% for the full year 2024 and beyond. Our recently
closed acquisition of Ametros augments our competitive position.
On the next slide, we've provided the overview of Ametros as a reminder of the business fundamentals, now that
they are officially a subsidiary of Webster. Ametros is a particularly unique and exciting opportunity as the
3

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
company provides a valuable service for its members and provides Webster with low-cost, fast-growing deposits
that add significant fee income. To describe the business in brief, Ametros administers recipients' funds for
medical claims settlements via a proprietary technology platform and service teams.
Ametros is already illustrating its growth potential as it has grown to $870 million in deposit balances relative to
$805 million in deposit balances when we announced the acquisition in December. It is our expectation, Ametros
will grow deposits at 25% CAGR over the next five years before considering potential benefits from expanding
existing partnerships, new market penetration or medical cost inflation.
Slide 4, which many of you are familiar with now, highlights our funding diversity and now officially incorporates
Ametros. As you will see on subsequent slides, we've combined Ametros with HSA Bank in a segment we've
named Healthcare Financial Services, with the segment reporting to our talented President and COO, Luis
Massiani. For the foreseeable future, we will continue to provide business specific performance measures for both
Ametros and HSA Bank.
Before turning it over to Glenn, let me touch on overall credit and more specifically, CRE. Consistent with industry
trends, we have seen negative risk rating migration and a return to pre-pandemic credit metrics. We continue to
proactively monitor our overall loan portfolio, and we complete deep dives on targeted segments frequently. While
trend lines point to continued pressure on credit performance, excluding office, we haven't seen any concentrated
or correlated problem areas with respect to any particular geography, industry sector or product type.
On slide 5, we provide incremental information on our commercial real estate portfolio as it continues to be a focal
point of investors in a higher for longer interest rate environment. Our commercial real estate portfolio is
diversified by geography and product type, is conservatively underwritten, [ph] has (00:07:00) continued to
perform well from an asset quality perspective. In its entirety, our commercial real estate portfolio has a weighted
average origination LTV of 56% and an amortizing debt service coverage ratio of 1.5 times. Classified loans are
1.5% of the portfolio with nonaccruals of just 10 basis points.
As rent-regulated multifamily lending has been in focus this quarter, we provided some of the attributes of our
portfolio on this slide as well. As you can see in the incremental detail we provide here, our modestly sized
portfolio is granular, was underwritten at conservative LTVs and debt service coverage ratios and has limited
maturities in the next two years. Additionally, a majority of the book was underwritten following the Housing
Stability Act passed in 2019. Therefore, our expectations for the performance of those properties incorporates the
unfavorable effects of this legislation on property cash flows.
In this category, the average loan size is $3.5 million. We have only seven exposures greater than $15 million,
and our largest rent-regulated multifamily loan is now $49 million. Given the underwriting of the loans and client
selection, the credit performance of this portfolio has been solid, as illustrated by just 10 basis points in classified
loans and nonaccruals.
We've also refreshed statistics on our office exposure on this page, where I'll point out that we continue to reduce
the size of our portfolio. We're actively working the portfolio. Given sector pressures, I would note that our New
York City office exposure is a manageable $217 million. In addition to the information here, there are two
additional slides at the front of the supplement to this presentation that provide significant detail on our overall
CRE portfolio, highlighting the diversity of the portfolio in terms of property type and geography.
Importantly, we have been disciplined in terms of hold levels over time as there are relatively few tall trees in
terms of single-point exposures across our various portfolios. Our larger exposures have a stronger weighted

average risk rating, as you would expect, and we currently have no classified exposures in the greater than $50
million CRE category.
With that, I'll turn it over to Glenn to cover our financials in more detail.

Glenn I. MacInnes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 6 with our GAAP and adjusted earnings for the first
quarter. We reported GAAP net income to common holders of $212 million with diluted earnings per share of
$1.23. On an adjusted basis, we reported net income to common shareholders of $233 million and diluted EPS of
$1.35. The largest component of the adjustments was [ph] an (00:09:55) addition to the estimated FDIC special
assessment of $12 million, a one-time tax adjustment of $11 million and $3 million in Ametros closing costs. In
addition, a securities repositioning loss was more than offset by an MSR sale. It is notable that there were no
sterling-related merger charges this quarter, and this will continue to be the case.
Next, I'll review the balance sheet trends, beginning on slide 7. Total assets were $76 billion at period end, up
$1.2 billion from the fourth quarter. Our security balances were up $250 million relative to the fourth quarter. The
yield on our portfolio increased 29 basis points linked quarter to 3.64% via the combination of growth,
reinvestment of cash flows and $388 million in restructuring executed this quarter. Loans were up $373 million,
driven by commercial categories and reflective of opportunities to gain market share. While total deposits were
flat, we grew core deposits $1.5 billion and retail CDs $350 million, which was offset by a decline in brokered
deposits. As John noted and you can see on this slide, we have aligned Ametros and HSA Bank for segment
presentation purposes, while still providing the same data on HSA Bank that we have historically. The loan to
deposit ratio was 84% in the range of where we expect to operate over the next few quarters. Borrowings
increased $1 billion as we use them for liquidity purposes, given the managed decline in brokered deposits.
Capital levels remained strong. The common equity tier 1 ratio was 10.5%, and our tangible common equity ratio
was 7.15%, both lower than prior quarter, primarily as a result of the Ametros acquisition. Tangible book value
decreased to $30.22 per common share, reflecting the impact of the Ametros acquisition and a small increase in
AFS security losses. In a steady interest rate environment, we anticipate $100 million of unrealized security
losses would accrete back into the capital annually.
Loan trends were highlighted on slide 8. In total, loans were up roughly $373 million or 0.7% on a linked quarter
basis. We reclassified $240 million of payroll finance and factoring loans to held-for-sale. We expect to execute on
the sale in the near future. Without the reclassification, loan growth would have been closer to 1.2% linked quarter
or approximately 5% annually. Growth was driven by commercial real estate, where we had the opportunities to
add new relationships and lower risk asset classes, including $275 million in multifamily and $424 million in
general commercial real estate categories. The yield on the portfolio was flat relative to prior quarter as a result of
a shift in mix offsetting higher loan origination yields. Floating and periodic loans were 59% of total loans at
quarter end.
We provide additional detail on deposits on slide 9. We grew our core deposits $1.5 billion and retail CDs $350
million this quarter. Given the strength of our core deposit growth, we reduced brokered deposits. The net effect
was effectively flat total deposits on a linked quarter basis. When combined, transactional and low cost long
duration Healthcare Financial Services deposits compromise 46% of our deposit base. Our DDA balances were
down $520 million relative to the prior quarter. Two-thirds of the decline was driven by clients moving excess cash
balances to higher yielding money market accounts, with the other third related to specific client transaction
activity.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
Our total cost of deposits was up just 8 basis points to 223 basis points this quarter, as the pace of deposit
repricing continues to slow. For the month of March, our deposit cost was 224 basis points. Increases were the
result of clients opting for higher yielding products, as well as renewals in the CD portfolio. Our cumulative cycle
to date total deposit beta is now 41%.
On slide 10, we rolled forward our deposit beta assumptions to incorporate the second quarter, during which we
expect our cycle to date beta to reach 42%, as a result of lag repricing impact and a continued higher rate
environment.
Moving to slide 11, we highlight our reported to adjusted income statement compared to our adjusted earnings for
the prior period. Overall, adjusted net income was down $18 million relative to the prior quarter. Net interest
income was down $3 million from prior quarter. This was a result of higher funding costs and lower day count,
partially offset by higher earning asset yields. Adjusted non-interest income was up $17 million. Adjusted
expenses were up $22 million, and the provision increased $9.5 million. Excluding adjustments, our tax rate was
20.7% this quarter, up from 19.5% in the fourth quarter. Our efficiency ratio was 45%.
On slide 12, we highlight net interest income, which declined $3 million or 0.6% linked quarter. The decline was
related to lower net interest margin and day count. The net interest margin was down 7 basis points to 335 basis
points, as a result of increased funding costs, which were partially offset by higher asset yields. Interest rate
hedges also contributed modestly to the decline. We recognized $11 million in cost this quarter versus $9 million
last quarter. As John highlighted, NIM was below our expectations as the macro environment made it challenging
to grow our higher spread assets that meet our risk criteria. Our yield on earning assets increased 5 basis points
over the prior quarter, with loan yields flat and securities portfolio up 29 basis points.
As previously noted, we repositioned $388 million of securities in the first quarter. This will improve our securities
yield by 4 basis points in the second quarter. Pace of deposit repricing continues to moderate and was up just 8
basis points. Total liability costs were up 11 basis points. We have provided detail on our hedging program on
slide 27 in the supplement of this presentation, which reviews the bank's asset sensitivity.
On slide 13, we highlight non-interest income, which was up $17 million versus prior quarter on an adjusted basis.
$11 million of the increase was driven by our Healthcare Financial Services segment with $6 million driven by the
seasonal increases and growth in HSA Bank and $5 million due to the addition of Ametros. An additional $5
million of the increase was attributed to a non-cash swing in the credit valuation adjustment. The remaining
drivers were related to BOLI events, commercial loan and other deposit fees.
Non-interest expenses on slide 14. We reported adjusted expenses of $321 million, up $22 million from the prior
quarter. $10 million of the increase came from Healthcare Financial Services with $7 million driven by Ametros
operating expense and intangibles, and $3 million due to seasonality and account growth at HSA Bank.
Remaining growth and expenses were related to seasonal increases in payroll tax and benefit costs, annual merit
and performance based incentives.
Slide 15 details components of our allowance for credit losses, which was up relative to prior quarter. After
recording $37 million in net charge-offs, we incurred a $43 million loan provision, of which $38 million was
attributable to macro and credit factors and $5 million of which was attributable to loan growth. As a result, our
allowance coverage to loans increased to 126 basis points from 125 basis points last quarter.
Slide 16 highlights our key asset quality metrics. On the upper left, non-performing assets increased $70 million
relative to prior quarter with non-performing loans now representing 56 basis points of total loans. Commercial

classified loans as a percent of commercial loans increased to 224 basis points from 182 basis points, as
classified loans increased by $183 million on an absolute basis. Classified loan increase was concentrated in C&I
portfolio across diverse industries. Our classified loan ratio remained well below Webster's pre-pandemic level.
Net charge-offs on the upper right totaled $37 million or 29 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis,
consistent with last quarter's level.
On slide 17, we maintained strong capital levels. All capital levels remain at or above our internal targets. Our
common equity tier 1 ratio was 10.5%, and our tangible common equity ratio was 7.2%. our tangible book value
was $30.22 a share.
I'll wrap up my comments on slide 18 with our outlook for 2024. The outlook includes the impact of Ametros,
which closed in January and directly impacts deposits, interest income, fees and expenses. We expect loans to
grow around 5% for the full year towards the lower end of our prior guide. Growth will continue to be driven by our
commercial business with more of a tilt to C&I relative to CRE categories. We are reiterating our deposit growth in
the 5% to 7% range, with growth in the commercial bank, full relationship deposits, retail deposits, interLINK,
Ametros and corporate deposits. We expect net interest income of roughly $2.4 billion on a non-FTE basis, which
is at the low end of our prior guide. For those modeling net interest income on an FTE basis, I would add roughly
$65 million to the outlook.
Our net interest income assumes two decreases to the Fed funds rate, with one in September and the other in
December. Non-interest income continues to be forecasted in the range of $375 million to $400 million. Adjusted
expenses continue to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.325 billion. Our efficiency ratio is expected to be in the
low to mid 40% range. We expect an effective tax rate of 21%. And of course, we will remain prudent managers of
capital, our long-term common equity tier 1 ratio remains at 10.5%.
With that, I'll turn it over back to John for closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Glenn. To follow up on one point in our outlook, while we have maintained our longer term 10.5%
common equity tier 1 target, I anticipate we'll run it closer to 11% in the near-term to medium-term given the
increased uncertainty generated by a higher for longer bias. We think we'd like to have incremental optionality in
our pocket and that would be prudent. Additionally, given higher capital levels in areas for which we see the
greatest opportunities for loan growth for the remainder of the year, we anticipate the commercial real estate
relative to our total capital levels should decline. Over the next four to six quarters, our intent is to bring CRE
concentration to approximately 250% of tier 1 capital plus reserves with a longer-term target closer to 200% as we
approach the $100 billion asset size threshold.
There are many more industry headwinds and tailwinds as we work our way through 2024. But I continue to be
very confident in our ability to navigate the current landscape, both offensively and defensively. We'll prioritize
strong capital levels and disciplined credit management. We'll continue to take care of our clients and deepen
those client relationships across business lines. We have a diverse funding profile and a loan to deposit ratio in
the mid-80s, providing us with significant flexibility and optionality on the funding side.
Finally, our efficient operating model and unique businesses should allow us to continue to provide better than
peer returns consistently over time. Finally, as you're all aware, Glenn recently informed me and our board of
directors of his intent to retire. We've kicked off a comprehensive search for his successor in partnership with
Spencer Stuart. There's been broad interest in the role, and we are confident that we will find a terrific person to

fill some big shoes. Glenn will, in all likelihood, be with us for at least the next earnings call. So I'll save my
farewell remarks for July. As all of you know, Glenn has been an invaluable asset to me and to the bank for more
than a decade, and he has shined over the last five years through a pandemic, a transformational merger, and the
industry events of last March.
Thank you all for joining us today. And Eric, Glenn and I will open the line for questions.

Please go ahead.

Good morning, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I was hoping to start just on the NIM and NII. If I look at where we are this quarter versus the guide, it suggests
that at some point this year kind of a material snapback in the overall quarterly cadence of NII. I was hoping you
could just help me better understand the rest of the year in terms at NII or where you expect that snapback to
occur on an NII basis or a NIM basis? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So let me start and, John, you can add some color to that. I mean, I think we look at it a couple of drivers
there, Matt. The first being loans and we're still guiding toward 5% loan growth. So if you think about on average,
you're probably talking about $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in average loans on a year-over-year basis. And so we'll
get the benefit of that. Likewise, on the investment portfolio, we'll get the full year benefit of the restructuring we
did in the fourth quarter and the [ph] add (00:23:53) that we did in the fourth quarter of $1.1 billion as well as the
restructuring we did in the first quarter. We continue to see opportunity in the securities portfolio on cash flow
basis where we'll have probably about $500 million a quarter that will reprice. We'll probably pick up 300 basis
points on that. And then, likewise, on the fixed rate loan portfolio, although it was somewhat softer in the first
quarter, we think that we'll probably get about $800 million a quarter on a fixed rate loan portfolio. It will probably
pick up about 200 basis points on that. So those are the tailwinds.
On the opposite side, we continue to see pressure on deposits. And so, I think our deposit cost as you saw in the
first quarter creeped up by 8 basis points. It was more moderate than we've seen in previous quarters. But I think,
as you look through the cycle, you would expect to see deposit costs continue to peak in the second and third
quarter. And so that will detract from some of the gain that we get on both the loan growth, the investment and the
repricing of fixed rate assets.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, Matt, I mean, I would just say, obviously, we're trying desperately not to overpromise and under deliver,
that's not our style over seven years. The first quarter was interesting in that we had back-ended loan growth. We
had very little loan growth in Sponsor and Specialty. We're starting to see some more activity there. So our loan
yields were lower. The average loans were lower and some of our expectations of repricing of the portfolio that
Glenn mentioned that we had expected in this higher for longer environment didn't occur because we had a much
lower level of prepay and refinance and repricing activity in the book. We also had a short-term mix shift in
deposits which we think will rebound a bit and we get the full benefit of HSA and Ametros going forward.
So, I think if you add what Glenn just gave specifically with respect to opportunities for higher NII from the
securities portfolio, the moves we made from a more favorable deposit mix and from standard loan growth where
we see there being more contribution from our generally higher yielding loans. That's why we haven't moved that
– besides going to the low end of the original range we provided, that's why we've kind of said we think we're
going to be approximately around that $2.4 billion. If dynamics continue to change, wildcard on prepayments and
other things, obviously, will mix up the guidance, but it's our best view right now, quite frankly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I appreciate all that. And the next one is just on credit. All-in-all, the credit metrics look pretty solid still, but the
quarter-over-quarter change was notable. You'd mentioned there was nothing specific that was driving everything,
but I appreciate if there's any sort of common threads particularly in the C&I book. And then, John, you'd
mentioned kind of getting to a 200% CRE concentration over time. Does something similar hold true for the
reserve, which looks a little light versus your $100 billion bank peers as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, I mean, there's a whole bunch to unpack there. So I would say, from a credit perspective, you kind of nailed
it. If you look at all of the credit metrics, annualized charge-offs in the quarter are really sort of kind of in line with
what you're seeing in the industry, similar to what we had last quarter, the percentage increase in classified and
non-accruals looked high. But if you look at our absolute numbers, they're still below what Webster Bank reported
pre-pandemic at December 31, 2019. So I think you're right to say the absolute levels are still not kind of eye
popping. We are seeing negative risk rating migration. And I think it's consistent with those who have reported
thus far. And I think, as I mentioned in my comments, I think we believe there'll be more pressure, not less
pressure on credit as we work our way through whatever this, I think, pretty modest cycle will be.
We haven't really seen – we had a kind of a broad contribution on the classifieds and the non-performers actually
skewing a little bit more towards C&I and CRE. I think we've been really out in front on CRE. But the only way I
can characterize, I would say, there's – the only industry segment that we have seen some negative trending in is
healthcare services. But we think fundamentally that industry and area has really good fundamental dynamics
going forward. Otherwise, it's kind of idiosyncratic one-offs. So an equipment finance deal, a middle market
transaction, a healthcare services deal, a food and beverage company, so really just kind of one-off and only a
handful of loans that actually drove the increase in those categories.
So, we're not sounding the alarm everywhere. Jason's doing a terrific job of doing deep dives. So, I really kind of
just think it's a broad deterioration consistent what you see – we've seen throughout the industry. With respect to
the CRE concentration, I think your calculation, Matt, [ph] what l you do, you have us in the 280, 285 (00:29:10)

range or something? If we keep that portfolio generally flat and we do have some payoffs and some roll-offs
coming up as we move forward, still giving us an opportunity to originate healthy, really good structured
commercial real estate loans, which, by the way, we're making the best loans we've made now in non-office and
rent regulated multifamily because there aren't as many market participants. So we're getting better yields and
better structure.
But if you see us accrete capital back, that we lost in the Ametros acquisition, and you see us managing that, the
six quarter [ph] 250% (00:29:43) target is not significantly difficult to imagine while we're growing the balance
sheet. I do think over time, the reality is over the next three years, as we start to approach category four, we'll
have to continue to have commercial real estate be less of a concentration overall. I do think, over time, looking at
capital levels, a combination of capital levels and reserves, those things will probably tick up. I think we can do
that in an orderly fashion. Given the makeup of our balance sheet, we don't have a lot of consumer unsecured, we
don't have cards. So it's not just the fact that we're in this new category. I think it's also the makeup of the balance
sheet. So I think going forward, it's not going to be a segment earnings, but you'll probably see us evolve from a
capital and reserve perspective as we move forward depending on the makeup of the balance sheet.

John, a question on normalized charge-offs. You've kind of been in this 25 basis point, 30 basis point range. How
do you view this environment in the context of normal?

John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I think, in the benign credit environment leading up to the pandemic, I think we were in the 20 basis
point range give or take. The last few quarters to be completely transparent. Obviously, we had a decent portion
of the charge-offs were related to proactive balance sheet management loan sales. This quarter, the vast majority
of the charge-offs were what I would call kind of liquidated charge-offs, they happened. They weren't related to

asset sales. So, I do think that there's more pressure on credit. I think anything below 40 basis points in terms of
cycle, 40, 50 basis points in commercial, it's still absolutely absorbable by our cash flows and our earnings power.
I think what I would tell you right now is we're seeing across the industry the beginning of what I believe will be a
shallow credit correction and the way we look at things going forward, Chris, I still think our provision that the
Street has for the full year, it's kind of what we're building in even looking at our risk rating migration, and our
classified assets and our non-accruals in the outcomes of the loss given defaults on loans that may be troubled.
So, this 30 basis points, I would say, is slightly higher. It doesn't portend to have a huge credit correction. Could it
go higher in any one quarter? I think you've heard a lot of people say in this earnings cycle, when you have a
large commercial loan portfolio, that thing can bounce around a little bit because you really can't control what
happens. And if you have a couple of larger charge-offs that could bounce around from that 30 basis points. But I
kind of feel like we're in heightened alert. The ultimate overall metrics still are better than pre-pandemic or around
pre-pandemic, and it's a question of whether or not this is deeper. So could you see charge-offs go higher in
certain quarters? Yes. Would I be surprised if charge-offs were lower next quarter? I wouldn't be. So I hope that
gives you just some color of the way we're thinking.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's good. Thank you for that. And I guess my follow-up would be, you guys have been early on loan sales,
didn't do anything really meaningful this quarter. To get to that CRE target that you're talking about, is there a
scenario where you would accelerate that achievement?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think, it's just an economic exercise. We've got some great partnerships. We have some interesting
agency eligible loans in our portfolio, depending on the interest rate environment and what happens, there's
opportunity to do that without taking significant hits. We're looking at everything. And obviously, we want to make
sure that our clients, the ones where we have full relationships know that they're banking with us and we can
continue to support them. With respect to non-strategic loans that may have good market value and easily
salable, we obviously have some levers to pull. We could have in this quarter done that. We just didn't think the
economics made sense because there wasn't poor credit quality. It was just a question of kind of the earnings and
the yields on those loans. So I think my short answer would be yes, as we execute that repositioning and we
move forward and we don't want to jolt the income statement either from having lower earning assets, you will see
proactive, selective and opportunistic loan sales as we move forward, particularly if the interest rate environment
moderates as we head into 2025.

Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. Good morning. And Glenn, let me echo John's congratulations on your well-deserved retirement.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Thank you, Mark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Glenn, I -- in your modeling, I guess, I'm curious, how different would your full year NII estimate be if we have no
Fed rate cuts this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Not really. So we have one cut in September and December right now. And I think the difference, Mark, if I just
kept it flat is a total of $4 million. So it's not really relevant.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. And then, secondly, on the office book, it looks like you've got about $260 million of office loan
maturities this year. I guess, I'm curious, did the borrowers have anywhere else to go or are you sort of forced to
refinance for them? And, do you have – I assume at this point, pretty good line of sight into what's happening with
those individual credits. Do you see any problems on the horizon with that book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, obviously, it's a book we're looking at significantly. It's the area where you've had the biggest
decline in valuation. We give you the stats, Mark, that say, we start out from a pretty good loan to value
perspective, pretty good debt service. You've seen a small migration in the classifieds for us. We've done a really
good job of taking the book down from $1.7 billion to $1 billion over the last six or seven quarters. I think, now
what we're doing is focusing on kind of how we deal with, we're dealing with maturities there, the way we're
dealing with maturities across the entire CRE book and consistent with what you've heard from others during this
reporting cycle. We've had opportunities. We've been able to refi some. There is – I think you probably qualify
pretty well that there's not an immediate source of refinancing away from us, quite frankly, for most of these loans
unless they have unique circumstances.
So, we had a couple of payoffs, a couple of sales. In most cases where we're doing on the maturities shorter term
extensions, obviously, you can't – people will say, is the industry kicking the can forward? I guess at some level
they are, but we can't kick the can forward as an OCC-regulated bank. So what we're doing is making sure that
there's debt service in place at market or near market rates. We're making sure that we get kind of bootstrap
collateral. We get debt service coverage reserves. We get guarantees for periods of time. So, that's basically what
we have. I think we have 75% of our loans now have some sort of credit enhancement either through a guarantee
or a debt service reserve. And so, we're just kind of working our way through that portfolio.

And I think we're fortunate that our overall portfolio is relatively small, more than half of it is Class A. It's
geographically diverse. It's not all metro. And so, so far, and I'm knocking on wood here, we've been able to kind
of work with borrowers through it. And despite the precipitous drop in valuation that you're reading about and we
see some of that, the owners of these properties, most of them feel like they still have equity in the building. And
so they're willing to work with us to make sure we have a solid performing secured loan moving forward.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
John, I want to start on the loan outlook. So, for the banks that are reported this quarter, most CEOs are sound
like a bit more optimistic, citing improved pipelines, customer sentiment, et cetera. And you guys are taking the
range down to the lower end, not a massive change, but you're pushing to the lower end. What really changed
versus last quarter? And are you not also seeing an improvement in pipelines?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Oh, a good question. So I think if you look at the first quarter, we had 1.2% loan growth, which is kind of in line
with that 5%. And you're right, first quarter's usually a seasonally low origination quarter and obviously consistent
with everyone else, loan demand was sort of muted at the beginning of the year. And then we moved some loans
off, which we can talk about later with respect to payroll finance and factoring into held-for-sale. I think as we go
forward, our Sponsor and Specialty book, Steve, which, as you know, has been kind of a crown jewel of ours and
as we've seen the beginnings of green shoots and pipeline build there, but it's been slower activity in that sponsor
space. And so I think that was one reason. We talked just a second ago with Matt about commercial real estate
and the fact that we're going to be a little bit more selective and careful as we move forward in that segment, both
with respect to the kind of inherent risks and the optics of our concentration levels there.
And what I would say is definitely things getting better. I think the second half could be good. Could we
outperform on the 5%? Yes. But as I mentioned earlier, we don't like to overpromise and under-deliver. We were
disappointed this quarter by the NII. And I think we looked at the makeup of our portfolio, went to our business
13

line leaders and thought 5% was the right guide. I'm hoping that we can outperform that. We're seeing better
pipelines. We're not seeing as robust pipelines, but I think there's reason to be optimistic for the second half.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay, thanks. And then for my follow up. So on the margin, I know it came in a little bit weaker this quarter,
a lot of moving pieces are all wholesale funding, et cetera. For you Glenn, do you think this is a bottom for the
margin this quarter? And how do you think about NIM trending before we get any rate cuts and then maybe if we
do get rate cuts? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
So I think – so, Steve, I think margin will be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Net interest income will improve
quarter-over-quarter. But I think the margin where we are right now, 3.35% will probably be relatively flat. I do on
our forecast and the assumptions that I laid out before, whether it's loan growth or the investment portfolio, the
repricing stuff, I do think that our margin will get to like the 3.45%-ish by the end of the year, somewhere around
there. Potential upside depending on how quick we can reduce deposit costs, but that's how we're thinking of it
right now. So you can think of [ph] a four year average (00:42:07) – or a full year average margin somewhere
around 3.41%, 3.42% if you just look at the full year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. And I know you said in response to Mark's question, whether the cuts happened or not very material. But in
a cut scenario, given interLINK some of the higher cost deposits you have, would that benefit the margin
incrementally towards the end of the year if we get rate cuts, is that we should think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, it would. I mean, I think right now we see deposit costs, like I said, peaking in the second quarter between
the second and third quarter and then coming down. A big driver that, I talked about this on the last call, is of our
$60 billion in deposits, about 20% are sort of had the same characteristic of interLINK. So, they reprice pretty
quickly. So those are things like public funds. Those are things like interLINK. And there's some other products
there. So you can think about $12 billion that I would consider sort of high data products right now, but then they
reprice down pretty quickly. So, that would be the first tranche to go when the Fed cuts. We think that the deposit
beta on the way down is say, 20-plus percent on the way down. So I think – and that's reflective of like a three
month pipeline that the core deposits have to cycle through.
And so you will see that – when the Fed starts cutting, you will see that our deposit costs come down. The other
thing I'd point out is, we're starting to see the industry pull back a little and we've reduced – if I look at our CD
rates, for example, we had $2.2 billion come due in the first quarter, that repriced higher by 43 basis points. As I
look forward, there's another $2 billion in the second, another $2 billion in the third quarter, those are going to be
neutral. By the third quarter, it might even be accretive to us because one, we've reduced our rate and we've also
reduced the term. And so I think that the drag from the CDs repricing will be behind us beginning in the second
quarter.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to touch on expenses. So you guys kept the guide, which
implies a decent ramp from the current run rate. I know you guys still have to fully run rate Ametros. I'm just
wondering if that is conservative or just some color on what's the expense pressure there, if – for the midpoint of
the guide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Casey. I think you're right. We got a full year of – the full quarter of Ametros moving forward. So it
just annualized. I think we're keeping – I guess, to answer your question upfront, it's a conservative number, but
it's a conservative number based on the fact that we're building out our program and our work streams to make
sure as we move towards $100 million that we continue to invest in areas where we think it's important to make
sure that we're beefing up our control functions and compliance and others. We're also continuing to invest in
Treasury payment capabilities, digital channels to make sure that we're giving our clients all of the experiences
that they deserve. We've talked often about the fact that we're starting from a mid-40s efficiency ratio, a full 10%
lower than most of our peers. And I think a lot of folks will need to continue to invest, particularly the ones in the
$50 billion to $100 billion category, and we think that low starting point of efficiency gives us some flexibility.
Do we have opportunities to either switch up timing of expenses? We do. Do we have opportunities to continue to
look at the makeup of our business? We talked incessantly over eight quarters about while we've liked all of the
various business lines we had, that there were some that had – maybe were too small to really help us, and we
would reposition capital and you saw us do that with mortgage warehouse and you saw what Glenn talked about
moving the payroll finance and factoring balances to held for sale and us moving away from that business.
We do have other opportunities to continue to refine our business and reallocate capital that would also give us
some relief on cost pressures. So I think it's a realistic number given our plan as we move forward. I would say it's
conservative in that we do have levers to pull, should the top line not play out the way we think it will.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Thanks. And then just wanted to circle back on the loan growth. So if I'm understanding you correctly, CRE
is kind of run in place. The loan pipeline is – sounds okay. But CRE drove a ton of growth this quarter. It's 42% of
the loans. So that means to hit 5% for the rest of the year, the rest of the portfolio is going to have to average high
single-digit pace of growth. It just doesn't seem like that the pipeline supports that. And just some color there on
what buckets you're looking to grow to pick up the slack for CRE?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, fair question, Casey. So obviously, as you know, in these businesses, it's an aircraft carrier, right? So you'll
probably see healthy CRE originations in 2Q as well as we sort of work through the pipeline, and we continue to
kind of position ourselves and that's why we said kind of over the next six quarters, you'd see that change in the
balance sheet.
So I don't think you'll see a complete [ph] hole (00:48:26), if you will, from a commercial real estate perspective.
We do have increasing activity in our Sponsor & Specialty business, which has been historically a high-growth,
10% CAGR growth business over time, and you're starting to read about more private equity activity and we're
starting to see people gear up.
We have fund banking, which is a lever we can pull and that we're really doing well there from a strategic
perspective, not only growing high-quality, nice yielding assets, but getting deposits and other elements there. We
have a pipeline in the middle market. We've got our ABL and equipment finance businesses. And so we've got, I
think, enough levers to pull that when we sit there and look at the profile, we think that to the extent CRE slows in
the second half of the year, that we have plenty of levers to pull.
You've heard me say over and over again, in a normalized environment, we're a 10% commercial growth, and
we've done it over eight years consistently from a CAGR perspective. This is a unique environment. We've seen
fits and starts in overall loan demand. And now we are layering on top of that kind of a desire to mute CRE growth
compared to the rest. But as you said, that high single-digit loan growth in the other categories doesn't scare us a
ton as long as the market cooperates.
And by the way, you know that we're risk managers first, right? We really feel good about this bank. We're a bank
that has – even with the NIM compression, but really helping NIM at 3.35%. We've got a 45% efficiency ratio, a
[ph] 1.25% ROA and a 18% ROE (00:50:12). And so we're going to make sure that we're making the right short-
term moves, even if it means there's a quarter where we fall short. And I think our long-term growth targets and
objectives are completely attainable.
So our plan – we're not being blind, Casey, going into saying, hey, we're going to freeze CRE and we're going to
still have 5% loan growth. I think you're going to see CRE kind of taper with respect to its growth trajectory, and
we feel pretty confident about the other asset classes and our ability to grow those loans.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
Hey. Good morning. Maybe just switching over to deposits with DDA balances declining this quarter. Do you think
that we're near the bottom here? Or is there still some more diminishment you expect out of the base? And where
do you think deposit growth comes from to hit those targets going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So let me – so hi, Jared, it's Glenn. So I think we did see an acceleration in the first quarter of customers
sweeping excess cash into money market deposit accounts. But we do – if I look at my forecast, my forecast is –
has basically flattened that out. So I think I would think of the second quarter, a $10.5 billion on DDA that's
basically flattened out for the year.
As far as growth, the drivers and the guidance suggests $3 billion to $4 billion in deposit growth at the low and the
high range. So some of the key drivers are going to be in Ametros, obviously. So say, $100 million on the low
end, $150 million on high end. HAS, between $200 million and $500 million over – on the course of the year;
interLINK, I'd probably say about $1.4 billion, will grow between now and the end of the year. We still continue to
see CD growth. We saw $300 million in the quarter. I think for the full year, we're thinking it's probably about $500
million. And then the rest of that would be probably in wholesale funding or wholesale – the wholesale channels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. That's good color. Thanks. And then could you just give a little more color on the credit valuation moves
that we saw this quarter and what drove that? And how you guys could try to plan that going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So that's driven by – primarily by rates. So that – you saw the reduction last quarter as rates from the third
to the fourth quarter came down and then you see it from the fourth quarter to first quarter, sort of a snapback on
that. So that's – it's pretty much driven by rates. These are – this is the valuation part of our customer derivative
book, right? And so there's been some noise back and forth over the last couple of quarters.
It's hard to forecast. You can tie it to rates. And I would say if rates are stable right now, you'd probably expect it
to be relatively stable. As rates go down, it could – we could have a little bit of a hit, but not – nothing like we saw
from the third to the fourth quarter where it was $4.3 million [ph] from memory (00:53:49).

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Given the comments on capital and eventually moving that CRE to Tier 1 plus reserve number lower than even
250%. Does that mean that buybacks are off the table for the foreseeable future? Or do you think you could
restart once you get to that 11% CET1 level? And as we think about that 11% level as well, should we think about
that as a more permanent target now given that you want to eventually get to that 200% number? Or is it just a
function of moving up reserves, slowing the CRE loan growth and then you can bring that CET1 number back
down to 10.5%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think for the foreseeable future, 11% is the target, just given the overall dynamics of us and the
marketplace and some of the uncertainty from a credit perspective. So I think we're unlikely to buy back shares
during 2024 unless there's some other specific change.
We generate a lot of capital every year given our profitability metrics. So I do think, as we did from the closing of
the MOE 2.5 years ago or just over 2 years ago for that 11% level and we're moving forward and we're generating
capital, and we don't have a good internal use of that capital. We will return it to shareholders in the form of
dividends or more likely buyback given the fact that we feel comfortable with our dividend level.
So I think you could see that restart as we get into 2025 and as our capital level gets to 11%. So that's kind of our
view right now. Obviously, we've talked that from M&A perspective, we're not really focused at all on inorganic
growth right now. We would love to do more transactions like the Ametros transactions, which brings low-cost
deposits and fees. But right now, our focus is on working through – generating and delivering on our guidance,
taking care of our customers, making sure we work through credit, building capital back up to 11% and then we'll
be back to our normal kind of capital management plan in 2025.

Manan Gosalia Q

Very helpful. And then thanks for the detail on the rent-regulated multifamily exposure. I see that most balances
were originated post 2019. But can you talk about your comfort level with the credits and the level of reserving for
the 35% or so that was originated pre-2019? And are there any details that you can share on that portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Those are really small – generally, as we said, granular small balance accounts, average $3.5 million in
exposure. We're seeing kind of the metrics. We actually did a deep dive and try to look at the credit metrics, the

performance, the debt service and the LTV comparatively between the ones that were underwritten before and
after, and we're not seeing any differentiation in performance.
So the entirety of the book is kind of performing with very low levels of classified and criticized assets. I think one
of the key points to make, not only on our rent-regulated multifamily but on our multifamily book in general is that
we underwrite to in-place market rents. So we're not counting on there being rent increases at the end of the day
to ultimately service the debt and that has set us well. It doesn't mean that higher NOI – I mean, higher operating
costs can't impact NOI, but we haven't seen any degradation in the portfolio. So we're looking right now at a
similar portfolio construct and performance between pre- and post-2019 underwrites.

Thank you. Good morning, guys. Maybe first, just changing gears here, looking at the fee income guide. Just
curious if there's something in the $97.5 million core number that you did in the first quarter that you expect to
moderate? Or you think that that's a decent number to grow off of in 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So I think on that, we were – I think we still feel good, like I said in the guidance, the $375 million to $400
million. We did have a strong quarter. I think the guidance implies a range of $92 million to $100 million. And
some of the tailwinds, if I just sort of break it out, we still will get the benefit – the full year benefit of Ametros,
which will add, say, $1.5 million, $2 million beginning in the second quarter. And then we'll see increases in loan-
related fees, deposit servicing fees and stuff like that throughout the year.
Some of the headwinds that we'll see are – we'll see probably lower HSA interchange, which sort of peaks in the
first quarter. But I think all in all, we still feel good about the guide. And I would expect that you would expect that
it would be in the $98 million, $99 million range.

Daniel Tamayo Q

Okay. Great. Thanks, Glenn. Understood. And then maybe just a follow-up on the conversation on deposits. You
mentioned you're budgeting for non-interest-bearing to stay relatively flat for the rest of the year. If that were not to

be the case, if we did see some kind of decline in those balances as the year progressed, how would you expect
to go out and would you go out and fill the void with additional funding via wholesale channels? Or would you –
just curious how you would approach that scenario. And if there's a...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, I think...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
...kind of some kind of [indiscernible] (01:00:31).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. From a funding gap, the answer is yes. I mean, you – it's depending on new loan growth. Probably you get
some additional mix. And you'd probably see a move, as we've seen in the past, like money market deposits. So it
definitely increases your cost.
The other thing I'll point out, [ph] John (01:00:50), is that with Ametros and HSA, Ametros is at 7 or 8 basis points.
And we've come out of the box – they've come out of the box pretty strong on that. We closed at $800 million.
We're already at $871 million and it's just basically two months. And so we expect – we think that's going to grow
pretty good as well. And likewise, with HSA.
So I think there's a lot of – as John pointed out in the opening comments, when you look at our diverse funding
profile, there's a lot of levers we can pull. Short answer is if we saw some more pressure on DDA, we probably
use wholesale funding.
The last thing I'd point out on Ametros, by the way, and it is in this slide is that in that business, we have about
$3.5 billion of committed funds in the future. So those are contractual settlements. So if you think of that business,
there's $3.5 billion in a pipeline that's over years and years, but it's – that's the committed funds to that business.
And I think that represents a pretty significant opportunity for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. And I would just – again, I think I'm probably saying the same thing Glenn said. But what we saw in the first
quarter was less DDAs out creating funding [ph] holes (01:02:09), but DDAs to higher-yielding accounts internally.
So we didn't really – it didn't create a funding [ph] hole (01:02:15). It was just unfortunately higher cost deposits.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, guys. Good morning. John, in the beginning of the call, you noted you expect an ROA of 1.3% and a
ROATCE of 18% in 2024 and beyond. It's similar to the adjusted results this quarter. Is that how we should also
think about this as a through-the-cycle return target? And if you can elaborate on any underlying macro
assumptions behind that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean I think if you just take kind of where our guidance is right now, kind of that's the output, right? And
the reason we talk about those return metrics is that when we announced the merger with Sterling three years
ago, we thought that structurally, this is what this company can generate with respect to returns.
And interestingly, nothing in our original assumptions about the macro environment when we did the deal has
come true. We've seen a precipitous change in Fed funds, unprecedented. We've seen banking crises, we've
seen pressures on liquidity, we've seen outflows of deposits. And through that all, we've continued to post those
kind of high teens ROATC (sic) [ROATCE] (01:03:44) and kind of a 1.2% to 1.4% ROA. Obviously, this quarter, it
was down a little.
But if we look at our modeling and we sensitize to credit performance, given our efficient operating model and our
funding sources, like those are our targets. And we've been able to post those targets for the last nine quarters
since the merger closed and those remain our targets. And what could hurt that would be things like a more
significant credit crisis, something unexpected in deposit prices and other inflows and outflows. But if you look at
our modeling and you look at our history, we think that kind of we're geared up to be able to deliver those returns
through cycles.

Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And just separately, I appreciate the additional CRE slides in the deck this
quarter. In your latest 10-Q, I believe you disclosed the CRE office reserves of nearly $36 million. Just wondering
how is that tracking as of [ph] 3/31 (01:04:47)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
[ph] We disclosed it first where we – (01:04:51) those reserves have moved up their 5% of the traditional office
portfolio now. I think last quarter, they were...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

3.5%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Good morning. And Glenn, I just...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
... [ph] wanted to say congrats to you (01:05:30). Just if we could jump back to C&I, that's where you had a big
jump in non-performers. Can you help us think about going from $135 million to $204 million in non-performers in
the quarter, where we're seeing that jump? Where – any details? Is it Sponsor & Specialty Finance? Is it ABL?
How much is mixed? Any color you can share with us there? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Laurie, I will try. We – at a company our size, we certainly don't talk about specific credits, but there were,
say, four credits in the C&I. We had a contractor, healthcare services, a food and restaurant company, one retail
CRE. That's sort of the representation across it. Again, I think I try and look at the macro picture. Obviously, [ph]
Jason (01:06:23) is looking at the micro picture to see whether there's any correlated risk.
So if I told you they were five sponsor deals in a particular segment, I would be transparent and tell you that and
say we're concerned about it and give you more portfolio detail, but these were really idiosyncratic across five
different categories across our C&I and one CRE deal. And again, I think the critical element is that our
nonaccrual loans, if you look at peers that have reported so far or you look at Webster's nonaccrual levels pre-
pandemic, [ph] where we still haven't approached (01:06:56) the benign credit environment level there.
And I'm not portending that we won't because I said we'll continue to have pressure, but nothing we've seen has
suggested that there's a pocket of weakness, poor underwriting, asset class, business line or geography that has
us particularly concerned. We're really reviewing the whole portfolio. So I would say it's idiosyncratic across
industries, across sectors and business lines in the quarter and a move back to a more normal level of non-
performers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Got it. And then just especially the Sponsor & Specialty book, how much is that non-performing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Wait. Can you repeat the question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Yeah, the Sponsor & Specialty book, what is the non-performing rate there or dollar amount there, the $6.7 billion
book?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
About 2% – about 2%. About 2%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. Great. And then just going back to margin here. Do you have the spot margin? And then can you just
comment a little bit in terms of FHLB borrowings? I was thinking that the Ametros acquisition, you would probably
be paying that down, that's costing 5.5%. Can you just share with us...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
...I guess, what you're thinking there? Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
So the spot NIM at the end of the quarter was exactly where we were for the full quarter, so say, 3.35%. Spot
deposit costs, I said on the call, 224 basis points, so up 1 basis point from where we were for the quarter and
loans down 2 basis points, so [ph] 622 basis points (01:08:39).
And then with respect to FHLB, I mean part of the dynamic there, Laurie, is that we've paid down or we've let
expire brokered CDs. And so the FHLB borrowings allow us to be a little more flexible than winding up broker
CDs, returns and stuff like that. And so we can tap that resource in order to fund any shortfalls and things like
that. So I think that's the way I would think about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to John Ciulla for
closing remarks. Please go ahead.
