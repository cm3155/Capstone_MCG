Margaret M. Keane
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 2019 marked another year of significant
transformation for Synchrony. Across all of our sales platforms, we renewed more than 50 existing partnerships,
while also signing 30 new business deals. We expanded our CareCredit card network and our Auto and Home
networks. We significantly enhanced the digital experience for cardholders, and substantially grew our direct-to-
consumer deposit platform.
During our five years as a public company, we have made significant investments in people and technology, and
that has propelled the company forward and enabled the development of innovative offerings for our partners and
enhanced our capabilities and user experiences for our cardholders.
In the fourth quarter, earnings were $731 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, which included the remaining
reduction in the reserve related to the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio in October. The reduction totaled
$38 million or $28 million after-tax, and provided an EPS benefit of $0.05 to the quarter as outlined in slide 3 of
the presentation.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Loan receivables were down 6%. However, on a core basis, which excludes Walmart and the Yamaha portfolio
that we moved to loans held for sale in the fourth quarter, loan receivables were up 5%. On a core basis, the loan
receivable growth drove 5% growth in interest and fees.
Purchase volume was up 7% and average active accounts increased 3%. The efficiency ratio was 34.8%,
including a restructuring charge of $21 million for employee costs, which had a 60 basis point impact on the
efficiency ratio this quarter, as we continue to drive cost efficiency for the company.
We grew deposits $1.1 billion, or 2% over last year, and much of this growth has come through direct deposits,
which grew 10%. Our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source for our growth and we continue
to invest in our bank to help attract new deposits and retain existing customers. While organic growth continues to
present the largest opportunity for us and we have demonstrated our ability to not only grow our existing
programs, but also launched new programs with fast-growing partners in new markets.
In our Retail Card sales platform, we announced a new partnership with Verizon, where we will be the exclusive
issuer of Verizon's co-branded consumer credit card. Together, we are launching the first credit card designed
specifically for Verizon's customers. We are thrilled to be working with Verizon as they continue to bring
innovation to their customers, and this is a great growth opportunity for us as we continue to diversify our portfolio.
The new Verizon credit card is expected to launch during the first half of this year.
We established new Payment Solutions relationships with Mor Furniture for Less, Grand Home Furnishings,
Travis Industries, and Leisure Pro, and renewed key relationships with Rooms To Go, BuyMax Alliance,
CFMOTO, and Continental Tires.
We remain focused on growing our network to create broader acceptance and utility for our cards, and we have
had many recent successes on that front in our CareCredit network. In the fourth quarter, CareCredit established
a new relationship with Kaiser Permanente. We've been focused on adding health systems to our CareCredit
network, and with the addition of Kaiser Permanente, we now have five health systems under contract. During the
quarter, we also renewed a key CareCredit relationship with Demant, a global market leader in hearing health.
We continue to remain highly focused on digital innovation, accelerating our data analytics capabilities and
creating frictionless customer experiences, which are key to the success of our programs and winning new
partnerships. Driving digital sales penetration is key to our success. In Retail Card, digital sales penetration was
39% in the fourth quarter.
We are happy to report that we have reached a new high on digital applications, which were 52% of our total
applications in the fourth quarter. The mobile channel alone grew over 40% compared to the same quarter last
year, excluding Walmart.
Our capital allocation strategy drives strong growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns, while maintaining a strong
balance sheet and the ability to return capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.4 billion of
Synchrony Financial common stock and paid $141 million in dividends.
We concluded 2019 having made significant advances in our capabilities and winning key partnerships that will
generate long-term value for the company. We have a clear vision for our future and what we need to do to get
there. Later in the call, Brian Doubles will outline our strategic priorities as we move into 2020.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
I will take a moment to highlight our platform results on slide 4. In Retail Card, loans were down 12%, but
increased 4% on a core basis, with solid growth driven by our digital partners. Other metrics were down, driven by
the sale of the Walmart portfolio. We are excited about our new partnership with Verizon, in addition to the other
partnerships we announced in 2019 and look forward to launching these new programs this year.
Payment Solutions delivered a strong quarter with broad-based growth across the sales platform, and particular
strength in home furnishings and home specialty that resulted in loan receivable growth of 4% or 7% on a core
basis. Interest and fees on loans increased 4%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume
was up 6% and average active accounts increased 3%.
We signed a number of new programs and renewed key partnerships this quarter. We continued to drive growth
organically through our partnerships and card networks. These networks along with other initiatives, such as
driving higher card reuse, which now stands at approximately 31% of purchase volume, excluding oil and gas,
have helped to drive solid results and position the Payment Solutions platform for future growth.
CareCredit also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 8% was led by our dental and veterinary
specialties. Interest and fees on loans increased 9%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase
volume was up 12% and average active accounts increased 5%.
We continue to expand our network and the utility of our card, most recently through our partnership with Kaiser
Permanente, which helped to drive the reuse rate to 54% of purchase volume in the fourth quarter. Throughout
the year, we drove strong growth across our sales platforms.
We extended and expanded relationships, signed exciting new partnerships, launched new programs, increased
the utility of our cards and networks, and grew our Payment Solutions platform to over $20 billion and our
CareCredit network to over $10 billion in receivables. Our efforts and achievements provide a strong foundation
for the future.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Wenzel to review our financial performance for the quarter and year, and
our outlook for 2020.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Margaret, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 5 of the presentation. This morning, we reported
fourth quarter earnings of $731 million, or $1.15 per diluted share. This include the remaining reduction in the
reserve related to the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio in October. As Margaret noted earlier, the reduction
totaled $38 million, or $28 million after-tax, and provided an EPS benefit of $0.05 to the quarter.
We generated solid year-over-year growth in several areas as noted on slide 6. Excluding Walmart and the
Yamaha portfolio, which was moved to loans held for sale in the fourth quarter, loan receivables were up 5% on a
core basis. Interest and fees on loan receivables were also up 5% on a core basis over last year, driven by the
growth in receivables.
On a core basis, purchase volume growth was 7% and average active accounts increased 3% over last year.
Overall, we're pleased with the underlying growth we generated across the business, as well as the risk-adjusted
returns on this growth.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
RSAs increased $174 million or 20% from last year. Improved program performance and growth primarily drove
the increase. The increase also included the RSA impact resulting from the $17 million release of reserves due to
the reclassification of loan receivables to held for sale for Yamaha.
RSAs as a percent of average receivables was 4.8% for the quarter. The RSA percent was impacted by the sale
of the Walmart portfolio, which operated at an RSA percent below the company average, in addition to the factors
driving the increase in RSAs.
The provision for loan losses decreased $348 million or 24% from last year. The reduction was mainly driven by
the lower core reserve build and a reduction in net charge-offs. The core reserve build for the fourth quarter was
$50 million.
Other income increased $40 million over last year, mainly due to lower loyalty cost as a result of the Walmart
program conversion. Other expenses were basically flat to last year but included a restructuring charge of $21
million included in employee costs. So overall, the company continued to generate solid results in the fourth
quarter.
I'll move to slide 7 to cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income decreased 7% from
last year, primarily driven by a 6% decrease in interest and fees on loan receivables due to the sale of the
Walmart portfolio. On a core basis, interest and fees on loan receivables increased 5%.
The net interest margin was 15.01% compared to last year's margin of 16.06%. The main factors driving the
margin performance were a decline in loan receivables mix as a percent of total earning assets. The mix declined
from 83.5% to 80.2%, driven by holding excess liquidity of approximately $3 billion resulting from the proceeds of
the sale of the Walmart portfolio; a 33 basis point decrease in the loan receivables yield to 20.87%, primarily
driven by the sale of the Walmart portfolio; and a 10 basis point increase in total interest-bearing liabilities cost to
2.58%, primarily due to the higher benchmark rates. Later in the call, I'll provide more insight on the direction of
the net interest margin for 2020, including the impact from the sale of the Walmart portfolio.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 8. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with our
delinquency trends. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.44% compared to 4.76% last year and the 90-plus
delinquency rate was 2.15% compared to 2.29% last year. If you exclude the impact of the PayPal Credit program
and the Walmart portfolio, the 30-plus delinquency rate and the 90-plus delinquency rate were flat compared to
last year, reflecting continued stable credit trends.
Focusing on net charge-off trends, the net charge-off rate was 5.15% compared to 5.54% last year. The reduction
in the net charge-off rate was primarily driven by Walmart and improving credit trends. This was partially offset by
the purchase accounting impact in 2018 related to the PayPal Credit program. Excluding the impact of the PayPal
Credit program and the Walmart portfolio, the net charge-off rate was approximately 15 basis points lower than
last year.
The allowance for loan losses as a percent of loan receivables was 6.42%. The core reserve build in the fourth
quarter was $50 million, excluding the impact of the final reduction in the reserve related to the Walmart portfolio,
which was $38 million, and a release of the reserves of $17 million for the Yamaha portfolio, which was
reclassified to held for sale in the fourth quarter. The Yamaha release had no impact on net earnings due to the
RSA offset I discussed earlier.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
In summary, the core credit trends have leveled off and are slightly better than our expectations. We expect the
core trends to show stability as we move forward, assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good
opportunities for growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Later, I'll provide an outlook on credit expectations for
the year, including the impact of adopting CECL.
Moving to slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $1.1 billion, basically flat
compared to last year. This includes a restructuring charge of $21 million included in employee costs in the fourth
quarter. While we did see an increase in expenses driven by growth, this was offset by cost reductions from
Walmart. We achieved our cost reductions goal for Walmart, and those cost reductions will be in the expense run
rate for 2020.
The efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter increased to 34.8%. The increase was primarily driven by Walmart,
which operated at a lower efficiency ratio than the company average, higher RSAs, including the impact from the
Yamaha portfolio, and also included the restructuring charge.
Moving to slide 10, over the last year, we've grown our deposits $1.1 billion or 2%. This puts deposits at 77% of
our funding, compared to 73% last year. While we slowed overall deposit growth in the second half of 2019 in
anticipation of the proceeds from the Walmart sale, we did continue to grow lower cost direct deposits at a strong
10% pace in the fourth quarter.
Focusing on capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 14.1% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules, a
slight increase over last year. In November, we completed our first preferred stock issuance totaling $750 million
at a fixed rate of 5.625%. The issuance had strong demand and was significantly oversubscribed.
During the quarter, we continued to execute on our capital plan we announced in May. We paid a common stock
dividend of $0.22 per share and repurchased $1.4 billion or 38.4 million shares of common stock during the fourth
quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, we have approximately $1.3 billion of remaining share repurchase
capacity of the $4 billion board authorized plan which runs through June 30 2020.
Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $23.4 billion, which equated to 22.3% of our total assets.
This is up from 18% last year, reflecting the approximate $3 billion of excess liquidity we're holding from the
proceeds from the sale of the Walmart portfolio.
Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We're committed to maintaining a
very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources, and strong capital and liquidity levels. We expect to
continue deploying capital through growth, and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and
share repurchases.
Next on slide 11, I'll recap our 2019 performance compared to the outlook we provided last January. Starting with
loan receivables, our core growth of 5% was in line with our outlook range of 5% to 7%. Organic growth remained
the primary driver of the solid results. Strong value props on our cards, effective marketing strategies, continued
investments in technology, digital assets and data analytic capabilities are enhancing our ability to drive organic
growth as well as win new programs. We continue to see strong growth of 7% to 8% in our Payment Solutions
and CareCredit sales platforms.
Net interest margin was 15.78% for the year, in line with the 15.75% to 16% range we expected. We did see the
margin impact resulting from the sale of the Walmart portfolio in the fourth quarter, and the impact will continue
into 2020, which I will cover in our 2020 outlook.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
RSAs as a percent of average receivables came in higher than our outlook last January. RSAs were 4.4% for the
year compared to our outlook of 4.0% to 4.2%. The higher RSA percent was mainly driven by improved program
and credit performance in 2019, and included the RSA impact resulting from the release of reserves related to
Yamaha.
Our net charge-off rate of 5.6% was below our 5.7% to 5.9% outlook range for the year. Credit trends moderately
improved in 2019, slightly better than our expectations. The sale of the Walmart portfolio also had a positive
impact on the net charge-off rate in the fourth quarter and that will continue into 2020.
The efficiency ratio for the year was 31.9%, slightly above our expectations. This was mainly due to higher RSAs
that resulted from improved program and credit performance during 2019 and also included the restructuring
charge we recognized during the fourth quarter.
Finally, excluding the impact of the reductions in the Walmart reserve, we generated a return on assets of 2.7%
versus our expectations of approximately 2.5%.
On slide 12, I'll recap the estimated impact of adopting CECL. The adoption of CECL was effective on January
1st, so no impact on 2019. The initial adjustment is recorded to retain earnings and does not impact net earnings
or EPS.
The initial impact on the allowance for loan losses from the adoption of CECL on January 1st was an increase of
approximately $3 billion or 54% of the year-end balance, in line with our expectations. The reduction to retained
earnings from the after-tax impact is approximately $2.3 billion, as well as creating a deferred tax asset of
approximately $700 million.
On a regulatory basis, we elected to phase in the approximate $2.3 billion impact on capital at 25% per year in
each year from 2020 to 2023. On a CET1 transition basis, this will impact the ratio by approximately 60 basis
points per year during the phase in period.
We want to continue to emphasize our view that CECL is an accounting versus an economic change. CECL does
not affect the cash flows generated by the company, how we view the lifetime value of an account or the IRR of
marketing investments.
We are providing the 2020 outlook which includes the anticipated impact of CECL and have highlighted those
specific measures where we expect to see the impact from CECL to provide comparability on how our
expectations align with 2019. Beginning with the first quarter, we expect to provide similar visibility to help with the
comparison to the prior year where the historical loss method was utilized.
Moving on to our 2020 outlook on slide 13, our macro assumptions for 2020 includes stable key benchmark and
unemployment rates throughout the year. Our outlook for receivable growth is in the 5% to 7% range.
As Margaret noted, we have new programs such as Venmo and Verizon that we'll be launching throughout the
year. As a result, we expect receivables growth to accelerate in the second half of the year. We expect the
purchase volume will run at our historical rate of 2 to 3 times broader retail sales and for online and mobile to
continue its strong growth.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
We believe our net interest margin will run in the 15.25% to 15.50% range for the year, lower than where margin
has run historically and with normal seasonality we see quarter-to-quarter. One factor driving lower margin
expectation is the excess liquidity of approximately $3 billion that we will be carrying on our balance sheet from
the proceeds of the Walmart sale.
We expect the excess liquidity will be deployed through growth as the year progresses. However, it will impact our
margin by an estimated 20 basis points in 2020. The other factor is the impact of not having the higher yields the
Walmart portfolio contributed.
Regarding the net interest margin performance throughout the year, we expect it to run closer to 15% in the first
half of the year, then trend back closer to the 15.50% during the second half of the year as we deploy the excess
liquidity.
We expect that RSAs as a percent of average receivables will be in the 4.3% to 4.5% range for 2020. The single
largest driver of the expected increase in the RSA outlook is the sale of the Walmart portfolio, which operated at a
lower RSA percent than our overall rate. The outlook is more in line with our historical run rate and reflects
continued strong performance of our programs.
While there will be no RSA offset on the initial CECL adjustment to reserves, the ongoing impact of CECL will be
included in the RSA which will provide a partial offset to the reserve increase. That offset is muted in the first half
of 2020 and then more fully realized in the second half of the year in accordance with the calculations of the RSA
and our program agreements.
In terms of credit, we expect the net charge-off rate for 2020 will be in the 5.4% to 5.6% range versus the 5.6% in
2019. The sale of the Walmart portfolio has a positive impact on the net charge-off rate.
Regarding loan loss reserve builds, we expect the total reserve build for the year under CECL will be in the $800
million to $900 million range versus $500 million to $600 million if we continue reserving under the same
methodology as 2019. This represents approximately a $300 million increase in reserve provisioning due to the
implementation of CECL. There are factors that can impact these ranges such as changes in economic trends,
consumer behavior, portfolio and product mix and the underlying assumptions used in determining the allowance
for loan losses.
We expect to operate the business with an efficiency ratio of approximately 32%, in line with 2019. Also impacting
the efficiency ratio will be the technology and people investments necessary to launch the new programs we have
noted. These are upfront investments we must make to broaden our capabilities and build the infrastructure
around the programs ahead of the actual launch.
The total estimated impact on 2020 EPS from launching these programs is approximately $0.20 of EPS dilution,
which includes investments ahead of the launch, operating costs and reserves related to the growth of these new
programs. While starting up these programs has a dilutive effect on EPS in 2020, we're excited about the future
potential they provide.
The preferred stock dividends will start this year and will be paid quarterly beginning in mid-February. The
dividends for the full year will amount to $42 million or a $0.07 reduction in EPS.
Finally, consistent with our track record, excluding the impact of CECL, we expect to generate a return on assets
of approximately 2.5% in 2020, which includes the dilution related to launching the new programs.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
As part of this outlook, I want to provide a view on certain key earnings drivers for the first quarter. We expect the
net interest margin to remain near 15% in the first quarter due to the factors I noted previously. Typically, we see
the net charge-off rate trend seasonally higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter due to the
seasonal decline in receivables. The increase has historically been in the range of 50 basis points and we expect
the trend in the first quarter to be similar. We expect that RSAs as a percent of average receivables will be in the
4.4% to 4.6% range with and without CECL impact.
Regarding reserve builds, we expect the build to be $75 million to $100 million with CECL and $50 million to $75
million excluding the impact of CECL. We expect the efficiency ratio to be approximately 33% for the first quarter,
then the ratio to trend down as the year progresses.
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian Doubles to highlight the strategies that will help drive future results.

Brian D. Doubles
President, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Brian. I'll close with a recap of our strategic priorities which are focused on driving long-term value
creation, while diversifying for the future. A top priority, as always, is the growth of our core partnerships.
Opportunities to grow will continue to be evaluated through the lens of the risk-adjusted returns they produce.
To strengthen our relationships, we will seek to continue to deliver innovative new products and capabilities that
add value to cardholders and the programs, and drive card usage and brand loyalty. We will also continue to
launch new programs, where we believe the partnership can deliver the opportunity for growth at attractive risk-
adjusted returns.
We will also seek to diversify through targeted strategies in Payment Solutions, CareCredit and our Synchrony-
branded products. This will help us to achieve a more diverse revenue base through the acceleration of growth in
small programs and new products. We will focus on growing Payment Solutions through enhanced point-of-sale
capabilities and innovative product offerings.
In CareCredit, we will continue to work on broader acceptance and further expansion of the network, with an
emphasis on health systems like our recently announced partnership with Kaiser Permanente. This is an area
where we see a significant opportunity.
We will also continue to invest in our Synchrony-branded products, the Auto and Home networks and the
Synchrony Mastercard. Lastly, we will leverage our recent acquisitions to develop and grow new revenue sources
in e-gifting and pets.
Technology and data analytics remain a key focus as we strive to provide best-in-class customer experiences.
We believe this customer-first approach will be an increasingly important growth driver. We will continue the
expansion of advanced data analytics, leveraging customer-level performance dynamics and further develop
capabilities to deliver frictionless customer experiences.
We're also focused on alternative data and machine learning to further drive innovation, advanced underwriting
and authentication. These investments are critical to driving growth in our existing programs, as well as securing
renewals and winning new programs like Venmo and Verizon.

It remains a key priority to operate our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile. We have proven
our ability to do this, and it will remain a top priority for us in the future. We expect to maintain strong capital and
liquidity to support our operations, business growth, credit ratings and regulatory targets.
Finally, we will continue to utilize our strong capital position to support growth, launch new programs, invest in
products and capabilities, and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We
believe we are well positioned for long-term growth, and we look forward to driving results for our partners,
cardholders and shareholders in 2020 and beyond.

So I wanted to start off with a question on the net interest margin. So, it had been running in the, call it, 15.75% to
16% range since you went public and deployed all your liquidity. Now, just to think about the moving pieces,
you're saying 15% for the first quarter, which means you need to be 15.5%-plus for the rest of the year to reach
the middle of the guide.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
So, I know it's hard to forecast very far out given all the moving pieces, but should we think about 15.50%-plus as
a more normal margin range once we get beyond this liquidity impact? And then second, are there any other
levers, particularly on the funding side, you could have to drive this back closer to that historical range? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, thanks, Ryan. So, yes, we're trending towards the 15% in the front half of the year. Really as we work
through the $3 billion of excess liquidity we have from Walmart coming off the fourth quarter, we obviously are
trying to work the funding profile and manage that to deploy that liquidity as fast as possible, including through
organic growth really in the first couple of quarters of 2020.
As we guided, the back half of the year should trend towards that 15.5%. So when you think about it year-over-
year, there's really the two major impacts, right? The first one is burning off this excess liquidity. The second is the
impact of the Walmart portfolio which operated at a higher margin than the company average and other portfolios.
So, obviously, Walmart was out for a part of the fourth quarter. So when you add those events, we should trend
back towards that 15.5% in the back part of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Okay. Got it. And maybe just to squeeze in a question on costs. So, I thought I heard you say that you achieved
all of the Walmart cost savings in the run rate. I just wanted to double check if that was the case. And can you
maybe just help us understand the moving pieces on the expense growth going forward? I know Brian Doubles
talked about some of them. But Margaret, maybe you could expand on what are some of the big strategic
investments that you're making. And would you view this as a year of accelerating cost growth and we could
potentially get back to something lower beyond this year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So I'll handle the first part and then give it over to Margaret. So, as you think about the cost, again, we're
guiding to approximately 32%, which is just 20 basis points higher than the full year average of 31.8%. Yes, we
did get the cost reductions that we anticipated for Walmart out and they'll be fully baked into the run rate as we
move forward. The impact slightly on the efficiency ratio again is Walmart-related. Because of the high revenue
that came off with that portfolio and what it generated, it ran at a much lower efficiency ratio as a portfolio than the
company average. So that's the slight tick up that you'll see there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Margaret M. Keane A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. And I think, Ryan, on investments, it's really a couple of things. So first is really the investment we're
making in Venmo and Verizon. Both of these programs are going to really be fully digitized in-app experiences.
And so we've added a number of agile teams to really develop a number of APIs to really deliver for those
partners. We have [ph] the launch fund (34:43). We have people that we need to add. So those are really a big
part of the strategic initiative in terms of those two programs.
More broadly, we're continuing to invest in a couple of key areas. We talked a little bit about CareCredit. We're
adding resources and technology enhancements there, particularly as we go into health systems, which we
believe is a really great investment and one where we'll get a great return over time.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
And just broadly, I would say, from a technology perspective, we continue on this journey of really driving
digitization and frictionless customer experiences. I'd say the other area we're very focused on is really what I
would call the customer journey. So, I think we've done a really good job on the front end, meaning how you apply
and buy and using your mobile capabilities, but we're really looking at how do we get more efficiency out of our
back office in terms of using digitization to really excel that experience for the customer. So it is a bit of
investment.
I think the biggest kind of add to the year is really, though, the Verizon and Venmo investment we're making. And
in our mind, those are two great opportunities for us for future growth. And we think that that investment is really
going to be the right investment to make for the company.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe A. Q
Orenbuch
Analyst, Credit Suisse
Securities (USA) LLC
Great. I was hoping that, and I kind of hate to ask a question like this kind of precise, but you did $4.03 billion of
net interest income in the fourth quarter. And usually you have a little bit of a seasonal decline in Q1 and then
start growing. Given that you do expect the margin to be higher and assets to grow and Walmart was almost
entirely out of Q4, is it reasonable that other than normal seasonal impacts that we should expect to see growth in
NII from the Q4 level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Moshe. Yes. As you think about the fourth quarter, Walmart was in for approximately, call it, 15, 20
days. So that impact when you think about the quarter, there will be a slight dilution as it relates to that. And then
really it's the excess liquidity that we're carrying that's impacting along with normal seasonality [ph] when you
think (37:12) sequentially quarter-over-quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe A. Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Right. But that excess liquidity isn't impacting dollars of net interest income in a material way, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, it's also impact – yes, it is impacting on dollars.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Moshe A. Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Okay. Second question just on the expenses. You talked about the charge and then – that was in the Q4 and then
some investments. Maybe just because you did say that you're going to have an improvement over time kind of
back on the efficiency side, maybe just can you talk a little bit about the approach that you're taking to those
investments, how you would see them paying back over what period of time and how we should think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So if you think about the investments, Margaret highlighted it, so you think about the investments in Verizon
and Venmo, there's different pieces of it, right? We have to pre-stage people, right? So we have teams been up
and standing up here to get these programs ready. We'll have certain launch costs as you think about research
that's done on the consumer, the value proposition, et cetera, that phases in.
As Margaret talked about, we're then standing up the IT and infrastructure. These are sizable opportunities and
we need to be at full-scale relative to the launches both Verizon in the first half and Venmo in the second half.
And given the nature of these two opportunities, there are specific things around data lake around how we're
doing digital servicing as Margaret talked about API. So that cost builds up, right, as we move through the year.
So that piece is the incremental.
We run with hopefully a very good cost discipline in the business. We got the cost reduction we wanted from
Walmart. We're continuing to try to drive out and drive efficiencies in the business and the processes whether it
sits in the enterprise operations side or across all our core functions. And we look at the business from multiple
different lenses and how we manage expenses and we'll be fairly disciplined as we move through 2020.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette &
Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. And appreciate all the CECL commentary. Thank you. So when we think about the loan
growth expectations that we have in 2020 and the growth that we saw this year, correct me if I'm wrong, but it
seems like the core portfolio is growing mid single-digits, which is lower than what we have seen in the past. Can
you guys talk about sort of how that will migrate over time, because you do have a set of more higher-growth
merchants now in the portfolio? And then maybe how – yeah, I guess, how it would migrate higher over the next
several years would be the question there.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. So as you think about growth, we're projecting 5% to 7% this year. We're coming off of 5%
last year. If you think about from the 17% to 19% range, our average growth was 4% to 7% ex the PayPal
acquisition. So we're growing in line with that.
Again, Verizon and Venmo will come in, they'll phase in. Again, they're de novo programs with one launch in the
first half, one launch in the second half. We're not providing long-term guidance relative to the growth rate, but
obviously they are start-up programs and that trajectory, we'll obviously provide guidance as we move into 2021.
So we're inside historical norms.
If you look inside the portfolio, there are moving pieces. Yes, we have some fast-growing portfolios, but we also
have some pockets that are not growing as fast that I'm sure you can recognize and they work in concert. So,
again, we're comfortable with the 5% to 7% range we have this year. It's within guidance. And then clearly, we'll
look at the trajectory of the new programs that we're launching this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And I guess two sort of data point-related follow-ups. The preferred stock issuance, what drove that? Was it
just diversifying funding sources? And then the charge-off rate, the relative charge-off rate to this year's guidance,
if we were to take out Walmart in 2019, do we have the metric around that like what that charge-off rate would
have been? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. With regard to your first question, we have talked long-term about our capital strategy and really moving
our capital levels, CET1, et cetera in line with peers. Along this journey, we started out with an 18% CET1, we're
down to 14% now. Part of that long-term capital strategy has been diversification to match our peers. So it was
always part of the strategy, it was included in our capital plan that we filed with the regulators and was approved
by our board earlier this year. So it was part of our diversification efforts really to lower the overall cost of equity.
So it was important for us to get it done, the timing of which – the market was very attractive. We got our 5.625%
rate for the preferred, a significant amount of institutional and retail investors. So it was significantly
oversubscribed. We obviously wanted access to the market and wanted to do it before 2020 and any potential
disruptions that may come to the market from unforeseen events. So that's really the rationale behind why we did
it.
And your second question was on – just remind me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, the charge-off rate, like, do we have the equivalent of that charge-off rate ex Walmart for 2019?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. We're not going to provide it, Sanjay, ex Walmart. But what I'd say is, this is – we gave you an indication
probably 18 months ago about what that rate was. What's happened since then, obviously, the portfolio has

deteriorated from $10 billion to the roughly $8.2 billion that we sold it at, as well as the fact that the credit
refinements that we put in place several years ago really helped to start reducing that. So the impact this year
was not as significant, right, as what we'd indicated 18 months ago.

Operator: Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit more about the interplay of CECL and the RSA? I mean, just on the
surface, the increase in provision seems like a pretty sizable amount, but I guess there's an offset. Can you just
talk more about that? I know you touched on it earlier.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Don. Yeah. So, as you think about the RSA, obviously, we've been talking to our partners for
several months about the change and how it impacts the RSAs. I just want to be clear, we are passing – for those
RSAs that participate in reserves, the RSA – the full amount of CECL will be reflected in the RSA. We did not
amend any of our agreements to either exclude or reduce the amount of reserve provisioning that those
agreements associated with. So I just want to be clear on that.
As you think about CECL and the impact to the RSA, I think it needs to be important to ground things. The
primary platform that uses RSAs is the Retail Card platform. That platform actually has a lower provisioning
relative to CECL, given its products and how it interacts. The Payment Solutions and CareCredit business, given
the longer duration promotional activity that happens there, actually attracts a larger CECL increase as you move
through. Also impacting that there's a slight lag that happens the way with which the calculations work as it
passes through. So again, you'll see that in the full run rate in the year, particularly in the back half of the year as
we move forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, thank you. And then, just quickly on underwriting, are you making any changes to your underwriting right
now, or are you sort of in a steady state? Are you seeing any competitors loosen up, just given the sort of better
economic outlook?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Yeah. We have not loosened up. What I would say is we've been pretty consistent in our underwriting. Obviously,
we're always making slight changes. I think one of the things we've talked about in the past is we've done a lot of
investing, in how we're creating our models and the data that we're using both externally and internally.
And so I think we're much more strategic in how we look at underwriting. And that's really helped us I think
continue to see the good performance we're seeing in delinquencies and charge-offs. So, we're being pretty
consistent. I think this is the time where you want to just continue to be very consistent and thoughtful as you think
about where we are in the cycle.

Ryan Cary Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Margaret M. Keane A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Cary Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I think most of the discussion around loan growth acceleration in 2020 is resulting from the new program launches
like Venmo and Verizon. But could there be any benefit from PayPal as the conversion is now behind you? And
has there been discussion about moving out to more of an integration phase, or is this more likely to benefit – is
longer – more likely to take a little bit longer term to ramp?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Margaret M. Keane A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
No. I think – look, I think PayPal is a fast-growing portfolio for us. It's performing the way we thought it would
perform. I think what we talked about last year was getting the portfolio converted which happened in June. It was
a fairly big and sophisticated conversion. What we're really focused on now with the PayPal team is really looking
at how we accelerate growth.
I think Venmo's a little different in the sense that it's a start-up. So it will take us a little longer to get that growth
going. But I'd say overall, we're pretty pleased about the growth that we're seeing. It's the kind of growth we want
to see. And I think as we add some of these new more digitally-driven partners, that will continue to play into our
portfolio.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
I do want to make one point that despite maybe some of the retailers struggling a little more, one of the things I
think we're definitely winning on is on the mobile side and we're definitely seeing growth in mobile. And I think as
we went through holiday, that was a big part of our win I think with our partners and our partners are continuing to
depend on us to really deliver capability to them to really drive growth digitally. So, I think that's something that
we're going to continue to focus on as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Let me just add one point of clarity. As you think about the primary amount of the growth for the year, when
you think about the 5% to 7%, is coming off the existing book. So while we're launching Verizon and Venmo,
given the timing of it during first half and second half, when you're thinking about that growth on end of period, it's
not going to be a big movement this year. It's something as we think about in future years, that's going to be an
accelerator. So just to make sure we're clear that the existing portfolio is driving that growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Cary Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, okay. And just wanted to ask one on the GPR card. I think you'd said there are number of direct mailings in
the quarter. I'm just curious about the resulting adoption and uptake and how that compared to your expectations.
Do you expect to accelerate direct marketing on the GPR card for next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So, look, we continue to see really good trends on the card. I'd say they're generally better than our
expectations on both of the campaigns that we've done. We're seeing good activation, good usage, nice retention
of the balances. But as I said last quarter, we're being very disciplined around profitability and returns, so – and
then short term, we've got modest growth expectations. We're being very thoughtful. Look, we realize it's a very
competitive market and we're trying to target profitable accounts. So, we really – we like this space. We like what
we're seeing so far, but we're going to be disciplined on how we approach this.

the range for the full year, 4.3% to 4.5%, but then you talked about how beginning of the year it will be lower and

end of the year will be higher. Is that within the range that you're identifying, or is this range the average for the
full year and the quarterlies could be beyond the range? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. The 4.3% to 4.5% is the average for the full year, Betsy. So again, we've given you some projections in the
first half. The real moving piece here, obviously, is the CECL impact, which is a little bit more muted the way the
contractual calculations work. That then normalizes in the back half of the year. But the 4.3% to 4.5% is the full
year estimate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So we could see the quarterlies be either side of that, or within – you're not really telling us, right? I just
want to make sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Again, it's going to average out to 4.3% to 4.5%. It could be at the lower end or it could be the higher end.
Obviously, it's going to vary relative to the program performance and the credit performance of the portfolio. So it
could vary. But again, I think...

Margaret M. Keane A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So, first, we're going to be doing their co-brand card. It will be branded Verizon. We're working very closely
with them to really make sure this is a state-of-the-art, digitally-driven card. We're pretty excited about some of the
things we're working on. We're not going to communicate the value prop and things like that, because that's going
to happen when we do the launch.
Look, they have about 119 retail phone connections. So this is a pretty big opportunity for us and we're excited
about the partnership. They're highly engaged. I'd say we won the deal because of some of the investments we've
been making. I think we turned the corner on the question mark in my mind of are we digitally savvy. And I think
based on the winners that we – the programs we won this year, I think we're winning because of these
investments that we've made and the investments that we're going to continue to make. So, very excited about
Verizon.

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
No, I don't think we – our underwriting standards are based on the consumer's capability to pay for the credit card.
So that's core to how we underwrite. I think the things that we're looking to further enhance is leveraging data
from our partners. For instance, I'd say more in how we set a credit line upfront. So if the partner shares with us
that this particular consumer shops very heavily, we might give a higher credit line than we normally would based
on that data. I think one of the important aspects of our business different than maybe the general purpose credit
card space is you can apply and buy right away. So we've got to be very disciplined from a line size perspective
when we give an initial line. And that's where I think we're really learning and really driving some good customer
experience, because we're sharing the data between us and the partner.
I think the other area is helping us on fraud and true name and using identity and things like that that are really
helping us. So, for instance, we've leveraged Payfone as an example where now on our mobile app you only have
to fill out three lines. And that's really helping us do a better job at identifying that customer. And again, a lot of
this has to do with because we're an apply-and-buy company, we have to be very diligent in identifying that if the
right customer that's applying.

Brian D. Doubles A
President, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Rick, maybe one thing just to add to that. I think it's – what we've seen so far is now that our partners are
sharing things like spend levels, number of visits to the store, average basket size, payment behavior, those
metrics which result in what we call an engagement index really cuts across income levels. And so we're finding
that to be a very powerful predictor in terms of how those accounts are going to perform, how they're going to
behave from a spend perspective, but also a loss perspective and fraud as well. So it's benefiting us in a number
of different areas.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Operator: And we have our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Carcache Q
Analyst, Nomura Instinet
Thanks. Good morning. Margaret and Brian Doubles, I wanted to ask you a question about whether you could
give us a sense of your interest level in Synchrony's exposure to potentially merchant receivables and essentially
making loans to merchants backed by their sales. Is there any potential growth opportunity there that you see for
Synchrony? Is it something you haven't given much thought to, but would consider, any color you can give us on
that would be great?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Margaret M. Keane A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. That's not a space that we're – I would say we are considering. I think we have laid out our strategy as
being focused on I think we're going to stick to the things we really know and grow that way. I don't if you...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Synchrony Financial
No. Yeah. I mean, look, we're a consumer lender, that's what we're good at, we're going to stick to our knitting
there. And we see a ton of great growth opportunities in our existing business which we outlined. So I think, never
say never, but it's not on the strategic map right now. I think we've got a ton of great growth opportunity in all three
of our platforms. We like what we're seeing in the direct-to-consumer space, so we're going full throttle in those
areas and we'll revisit at some point in the future, but right now, a lot of growth opportunity in the core.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Carcache Q
Analyst, Nomura Instinet
Understood. And so, then perhaps sticking with the consumer, is there any interest level and perhaps taking a
look at international consumer at some point or again is the growth opportunity enough in the US that you see,
that's probably not something that you would consider near-term, again, any color you can give on that would be
helpful as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, Bill, look, it's something we've considered, we've talked about it, the leadership team and with the board.
Again, I think we see enough opportunity right now in our current market and in the US that we don't feel the need
to go international, but never say never. The business does work in certain markets overseas, we've seen that,
we'll continue to assess it, but nothing in the short term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Carcache Q
Analyst, Nomura Instinet
Understood. Thank you for taking my questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Synchrony Financial
Sure.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Margaret M. Keane A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Wade Ketron A
Senior Vice President - Managing Director of Investor Relations, Synchrony Financial
Vanessa, we have time for one more question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our final question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John, your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Sorry, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, final question here is, maybe talk about the pipeline of
different opportunities. And then I guess from a broad perspective, it seems like the more recent partner wins
have been more technologically based with Verizon, PayPal, Venmo and so forth. And is there any changing
dynamics with who you're going after and is there any changing dynamics with respect to the competitive
environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Margaret M. Keane A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yes. I'll start with the second part. I think the competitive environment is pretty – has been pretty consistent. I
don't think anyone's doing anything too crazy out there. So I think we feel pretty good about where we're placed in
the competitive environment.
I think, look, we still want to win core retail deals, so this – and if you look at our Payment Solutions business, a lot
of what we won was the core of that business. I think these opportunities have come along or have been, I think,
somewhat unique in terms of them coming to the marketplace. There's just not a lot of big retail deals that are out
there right now in terms of existing portfolios.
We can – we continue to see a number of smaller mid-sized deals that we have in our pipeline. I would say, all
three platforms have a pretty good pipeline of opportunity and we're very focused on that. So, I think you'll see us,
down the road, you'll see more retail deals. It's not like we're walking away from that space. I just think this is what
was in the market and opportunity for us to – in some cases differentiate our portfolio a little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
