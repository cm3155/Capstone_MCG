Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Begoña, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for attending to this conference. So, as you say to
start this presentation that, well, we've been developing our activity in a unusual highly uncertain macro
environment. In this environment, we've been able to keep growing our customer base and translating this into
volumes growth and revenue growth. So the most remarkable change in the quarter probably has been the
acceleration – starting the acceleration of NII with a growth of 5% quarter-on-quarter. Probably, this is the main

event on the back of activity levels, and just starting to raise interest rates, particularly in the Eurozone where our
exposure to [indiscernible] (00:01:31) is high.
Our profitability improved significantly. Our return on tangible equity stays in 13.6%, EPS has grown at 31% on
the back of the profits we got in the quarter, €2.4 billion. After absorbing €181 million charge net of tax and
minorities in Poland, the growth number was north of €300 million related to the new payment holiday regulations.
Excluding it, profit grew 11% in the quarter, 10% in constant euros. In the nine months, our attributable profit, we
got €7.3 billion, increasing 25% with positive impact of the currencies being plus 14% in constant euros.
The credit quality on our balance sheet show no signs of duration so far in the quarter; overall, because of
[indiscernible] (00:02:39) below 1%, and we continue to generate capital at good pace. Finally, as you already
know, we continue to create value to our shareholders, both in terms of shareholder remuneration with the cash
dividend we announced, the board approved last month, and the growth in tangible net asset value per share that
provides a combined TNAV plus cash dividend per share of 11%.
Going into more details into the regions, you see the growth is well spread across the board. Both loans and
deposits is fairly balanced growth. We cannot say that we are growing just in one part of the business. We are
growing well across the board. In constant euros, loans increased 2% quarter-on-quarter, €17 billion, with
increases in almost all countries. Deposits were up 2% also in the quarter with some shift towards time deposits,
given the current interest rate environment. In the last 12 months, loans and deposits grew 7% and 6% in
constant euros.
Regarding our loan portfolio, naturally, this doesn't change quarter-on-quarter. [ph] Just to remind (00:03:52) that
our portfolio is fairly balanced. One-third is individual mortgages, mainly UK and Spain by this order, being UK by
far the largest, more than 50% of the total portfolio. The other [indiscernible] (00:04:07) consumer lending. The
majority is auto lending in Europe and in the US. And finally, we have an exposure north of [ph] €400 billion, close
to 14% of (00:04:19) our loan book, the majority in SMEs and corporates and in CIB. You see that all the main
portfolios are growing; so 7%, individual mortgages; 7%, consumer; 6%, companies. So, as I said, balanced
growth across the board.
Looking at the income statement, you have – we provide you growth rates both in euros and constant euros for
you to analyze in the best way you – in the way you can analyze. As you can see, there was a positive impact
from same rates of around 5 percentage points, 7 percentage points, partially offset by the FX hedge in the
Corporate Centre that is including gains on financial transactions. In constant euros, revenue grew at faster pace
than in Q1 and Q2 and cost faced inflationary pressures, but continued to grow below inflation.
Trends to this performance. Net operating income reached €21 billion, a record for the first nine months of the
year. In loan loss provisions that is one of the current topics in this particular environment, there were [ph] two
acquisition forces (00:05:41) impacting the year-on-year performance. On the other hand, in 2021, there were
COVID-19-related loan loss provision released in Q2 and Q4 of 2021 due to better-than-expected credit
performance. On the other hand, in 2022, loan loss provisions include an additional circa €1 billion in provision
related to [ph] updated (00:06:05) macro assumptions, mainly in the US, Spain and UK.
So, the macro provision, roughly speaking, was €1.1 billion; Spain represents €200 million; UK, €300 million; and
US, €500 million; and Digital, €100 million, of which €500 million [indiscernible] (00:06:23) funds, mainly coming
from COVID provisions that were initiated in the balance sheet. So, we are seeing this as an important
development in the quarter, some normalization in the US as we anticipate [indiscernible] (00:06:48-00:06:55).
José will elaborate [indiscernible] (00:06:57).

Additionally, this year, we recorded higher charges related to fund contributions and new resolution schemes, plus
lower minorities and tax borrowing, in our results, as you can see, €7.3 billion. Elaborating a little bit on the P&L
trends, [indiscernible] (00:07:14) to say, well, positive trends in customer revenue, especially NII in the last quarter
which we expect to continue as the positive impact of internal rate hikes [indiscernible] (00:07:25). The positive
impact is just starting in Europe and somehow more advanced in countries like UK and US, more so in Poland
and in Mexico. The opposite half is the negative impact, has happened in Brazil and Chile, as you know,
[indiscernible] (00:07:46) rates.
Secondly, our cost grew below inflation over the years in most countries. Our efficiency improved slightly to 45.5%
compared with full-year 2021. But this is being eroded by inflationary pressures in some regions by the lag
between the almost immediate impact on cost and the revenue benefit from higher rates coming late. Thirdly, in
general, we did not see any deterioration in the cost of risk or in the credit quality variable such as [indiscernible]
(00:08:18). We have very good cost of risk in Europe on the ECB and also in North America where both the US in
process of normalization and Mexico are performing better than expected.
In South America, the cost of risk, in general, was stable. You know that Brazil went up this year. For now – for
two quarters in a row, we've – it has been stable. We believe that we already reached the peak and some
indicators more [indiscernible] (00:08:48) more constructive on this going forward. All in all, we are confident for
the whole group to achieve our cost of risk target.
In relation with the profitability, I mentioned our ROTE stood at 15.6%. Earnings per share grew 31% [ph] and
backed by (00:09:12) higher profit and share buybacks, we bought back 3.2% and we amortized 3.2% of our
group's capital. Finally, regarding shareholder remuneration policy for 2022, our intention -the board already
approved 40% payout and half of this in cash by €5.83 in cash and €979 million in buybacks that we expect to be
approved by the ECB soon and we start to execute as soon as this is approved.
As a result, the total remuneration in this cash dividend is going to be €1.9 billion. Positive TNAV performance, I
mentioned before, that is increasing for several quarters in a row on given the performance that the profitability of
the group, a more constructive exchange rate combined.
Finally, on capital, we are very comfortable with our tier 1 – core equity tier 1 ratio remaining above 12%, a level
that we consider to be very appropriate for our business. In the quarter, net organic capital generation 26 basis
points after the 8 basis points accrual for the future cash dividend. The increase was partly offset by negative
impacts for markets available for sale portfolios, some for models – mainly model – markets and models.
At the same time, we continue to deliver our commitment of disciplined net capital allocation. As you can see on
the slide, risk-weighted asset grew well below loan growth, higher book from book profitability, and lower [ph]
wage (00:10:57) of risk weighted assets with return on equity below the cost of equity.
Now, our CFO, José García Cantera, will take you through the results in more detail.

Thank you, José Antonio, and good morning, everyone. After the CEO presentation, I will go through our
performance in more detail – in the quarter in more detail, and we'll look at the progress in terms of country and
the business.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
Starting with profit, on the right-hand side, you can see the upward trend in profitability, driven mainly by revenue,
which increased 5% in the quarter. This increase was supported by NII, which also increased 5% and which, as
we can see, has accelerated in the last two quarters, primarily as Spain and Portugal are beginning to benefit
from interest rate increases. In addition to the growth that we have already seen in countries like UK, Poland, US,
etcetera.
In North America, NII grew 6% with both countries growing more or less at the same pace. And in South America,
it was up 5%, supported by strong growth in Argentina, while Chile and Brazil showed negative sensitivity to rates,
especially Chile where we had lower inflation in the quarter. In Brazil, NII remained stable following declines in
previous quarters. I will explain this in a bit more detail when we go through Brazil.
The Digital Consumer Bank was practically flat due to the – although we have neutral position into rates in DCB,
it's slightly negative in the first quarter – couple of quarters. And [ph] then neutralize on that (00:12:42) what
explains this behavior. Net income was flat in the quarter, mostly due to weak performance in Europe due to
seasonality. We had lower fees charged on deposits from CIB large corporate clients and one-off in credit cards in
the second quarter in the UK. On the other hand, South America increased 5% with an excellent performance in
Chile and Argentina. Gains on financial transactions were higher, driven by CIB. Obviously, quarter-on-quarter
comparison in other income was affected by the contribution to the Single Resolution Fund in the second quarter.
This is our net interest income sensitivity to rates. This is consistent what we have shown in previous quarters.
This time around, we thought it would be better to look at forward rates rather than sensitivity to 100-basis point
change. So this is the sensitivity of forward rates relative to rates remaining stable over the next 12 months.
Obviously, the [ph] 80 bps (00:13:51) is fully comparable because now forward rates are almost 200 basis points
and the sensitivity we showed in the previous quarter was 100 basis points for the Eurozone for instance.
So, this is the sensitivity again of forward rates relative to rates remaining stable. As expected, obviously we have
very high sensitivity in euros. In sterling, we have some additional sensitivity from [ph] current (00:14:16) levels.
But obviously, the higher the rates, the higher the beta as well. So, the beta we have here is around 50% to 60%
in this exercise.
And in Brazil, as interest rates remain flat, asset repricing should gradually compensate the increase in the cost of
deposits, which as you know, is almost automatically repriced. It's important to note that this sensitivity is based
on the maintenance of the TLTRO-III conditions that exist at the moment and we all know that they will change
tomorrow. We don't know what the change will be. So, we'll adjust that accordingly in the next presentation.
Looking at cost, the CEO has already mentioned that costs are growing below inflation, which as you know, is one
of our targets. And as you can see on the slide, we are achieving – thanks to the transformation plans underway
in all countries particularly in Europe, a very good performance. We had in Europe, a 4 percentage point
improvement in the cost to income at the same time. As costs automatically adjust with inflation in emerging
markets, it takes a bit longer in Europe for that to happen.
So, I said in South America, the rising cost is explained by the automatic adjustment of cost to inflation particularly
in salaries in Brazil, Chile or Argentina. Even so, costs in the region fell a little bit in real terms and efficiency
remained excellent despite a slight increase. In North America, it's worth mentioning the investments that we
continue to make in Mexico to modernize our infrastructure.

In terms of credit quality, we are not seeing any significant deterioration. The NPL and coverage ratios have been
stable in recent quarters, as has the cost of risk. Stage 3 exposures increased in line with the credit portfolio. As
previously mentioned by our CEO, you can see the COVID-19-related provision releases in the second quarter
and fourth quarter of 2021, and the additional over €1 billion of macro provisions in 2022. José Antonio already
mentioned half of which came through the P&L and half where reclassifications of previously created COVID-
related provisions. Compared to 2021, there were loans provisions increases in the UK, in the US, Brazil and
Poland, but very much in line with what we expected.
Going into a bit more detail about the quality of our portfolio, we maintain a low risk profile balance sheet. It's
mostly concentrated in mature markets, 80% of the total exposure with approximately 65% in secured lending,
mostly by real estate collateral. Additionally, the main macroeconomic variables that affect our businesses,
particularly unemployment, are expected to remain resilient across our footprint.
Looking at the main countries, in Spain, 75% of our mortgage portfolio is floating. We have significantly reduced
the average loan to value and the percentage of mortgages with loan to values over 80% and our corporate
portfolio improved its rating. And as you know, the ICO portfolio is performing very well and better than expected.
Unemployment is low and stable and is expected to remain so. Housing affordability has improved significantly in
recent years. House prices are on average 30% lower in real terms than in 2008.
In the UK, 12% of the portfolio is floating. The simple average loan to value of mortgages is 40%, and less than
5% have loan to values over 80% versus 12% in 2015. In terms of macro, the UK has a very low unemployment
rate, which we believe will help avoid a sharp fall in prices. Moreover, affordability is currently at 34%, 10
percentage points lower than in 2008.
In the US, we changed the mix recently towards more prime, which currently represents 80% of the total auto
portfolio, and therefore is a better quality portfolio. Used car prices are clearly above historical levels. They should
gradually normalize, but this normalization should take place gradually, as I said, because of the scarcity of new
vehicles. And also, US unemployment is at very low levels, is expected to go up a bit but by no means reaching
the levels of previous crises.
Lastly, in Brazil, activity is gradually recovering. We are growing in low risk products. 65% of individuals' portfolio
is secure. The average maturity of our balance sheet in Brazil is a bit less than one-and-a-half years, which
means that asset quality deterioration surfaces very quickly. In summary, we remain constructive on the future of
our asset quality.
Now, let me go in a bit more detail through the main countries. Starting with Spain, we continue to see a very
dynamic market. In net customer, we have had positive net customer growth every month since December 2021.
We have increased transactionality and we've seen robust volumes growth. Year-on-year profit was reported by
our efficiency plans. Cost to income is down 2.4 percentage points and a reduction in loan loss provisions. The
nine-month annualized cost of risk is 62 basis points, including €200 million from macro adjustments. In revenue,
NII was under pressure in the first half, but it started to ease in the third quarter, growing 10% quarter-on-quarter,
starting to reflect hike in interest rates. Looking forward, for the next few months, we continue to see positive
trends in NII, lower cost base in absolute terms and controlled cost of risk.
In the UK, we continue to have positive new lending trends, and interest rate – higher interest rates obviously are
supporting NII growth. We had double-digit growth in revenue together with strong cost control. Costs were down
6% in real terms, which resulted in over 4% improvement in the cost to income and drove the strong operating
performance which was up 20%. Underlying profit was flat due to higher loan loss provisions versus releases in

2021. We are comfortable we will reach our targets both for return on tangible equity and cost to income with
double digit growth in NII and a year-on-year flat costs.
Turning to the US, again, also very solid business dynamics, both in loans and deposits. Underlying profit
remained high at €1.5 billion, well above average pre-pandemic levels, despite falling year-on-year following a
record nine months of 2021 affected by competitive pricing and obviously the normalization of the cost of risk. We
continue working on normalizing our capital levels in the US. So far, this year, over $3 billion have been
upstreamed to the corporate center. So, gradually we will show a more sort of transparent profitability levels in the
US, which, as you know, our objective for the long term is to keep returns on equity at around 15%. We maintain
our outlook for the year of 2022. Lower revenue impacted by leasing, flat costs and better than initially anticipated
cost of risk well below normalized levels.
In Mexico, another excellent quarter. Profit increased quarter-on-quarter driven by strong upturn in NII and lower
loan loss provisions. Costs were affected by the salary revisions that took place in July. We also delivered
[indiscernible] (00:22:31) profitability year-on-year supported by volumes growth, interest rate management,
higher fees and excellent risk behavior. For 2022, again, we maintain our expectations of double digit growth in
NII and fee income, higher growth in costs, affected by our investments in digitalization and obviously inflation and
a cost of risk of around 2%. The performance of asset quality in Mexico is excellent.
In Brazil, we continue to grow our customer base and volumes, dealing obviously with the pressure on margins
coming from repricing. As you know, we tightened our [ph] operational (00:23:17) standards in the high-risk
portfolios, particularly unsecured individual lending last September and that still continues. We are growing in low-
margin businesses, more particularly CIB and mortgages, and that change in mix is obviously affecting NII. But
NII, our repricing of assets, it is such out-weighting the repricing of liabilities is flattening. The quarter-on-quarter
NII is basically flat already in the third quarter and we would expect to see a very gradual improvement until more
or less in the first half, second quarter and it's starting to grow more after the third quarter of next year. Interest
rates have already peaked. We have a 12-month repricing gap. So, we would expect to see a gradually
increasing NII in the second half of next year.
Costs rose because of the automatic pass-through of inflation to costs in the country. Salary agreement in
September for 2023 was 8% relative to the 11% of last year. So, we have some positive news for cost in 2023.
Now, cost of risk around 4.5%, very much in line with our guidance. We would expect these to remain more or
less at these levels in the fourth quarter, maybe a touch higher, but around 4.5%, 4.6%, and gradually starting to
come down next year.
If we turn to the Digital Consumer Bank, here, the activity remains strong despite continuing market contraction.
We are gaining market share, particularly in used cars. We had double-digit profit growth supported by fees
leasing, and very good cost of risk performance. We expect a challenging environment for new cars, but we think
we will be able to continue to gain market share and we should be able to maintain high returns on equity in the
coming quarters.
In the global businesses, CIB reported its best quarter in its history, gaining market share in all businesses and
products. We expanded in the US. And we maintain our leading positions in the different countries in Latin
America. We are leaders in sustainability, ranking number one in Latin America, Europe, and globally, in
structured finance in the renewable sector. In terms of results, underlying profits grew 36% year-on-year, with
double-digit growth in all core businesses. Underlying attributable profit represented 27% of the group's total
operating profit.

In Wealth Management & Insurance, the contribution of this unit to the bank was 17% on a like-for-like basis, so
very good performance. Private banking is attracting new customers, up 6%. Also new money up €10 billion and
profits grew 30% year-on-year. In Santander Asset Management, the asset management business was affected
by market volatility, but it increased its contribution to group profits to 8%. Finally, in insurance, we have sustained
growth in gross written premiums and the total contribution to profit increased 15%. We expect to maintain
double-digit growth in profit contribution in this unit in the coming quarters.
In PagoNxt, total revenue increased 75% year-on-year in constant euros, almost 100% in euros fueled by all four
main businesses, especially merchants and trade. So we are doing better than our guidance of 50% revenue
target for the year. Activity is really going very well here.
And finally, in Cards, I would like to highlight the efforts that we are making to improve our credit card business.
We currently manage almost 100 million cards across the group and thanks to active customer management, nine
month revenue was 25% higher year-on-year in constant euros, 36% in euros with very positive performance in
both credit and debit cards across the regions, particularly in South America.
Let me now turn it back to José Antonio for his final comments. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Yes. A few words in relation with the outlook, so I should say that, we expect significant revenue growth on the
back of activity levels that will remain healthy, particularly in our global business with the capacity to generate
additional net fee income, and while the additional NII growth that benefiting from activity and interest rate hikes.
So, fairly constructive on our capacity to keep growing our revenues in the coming quarters.
On the costs side, well, we face inflation pressures, you're seeing it through the P&L. But I'm confident that we'll
continue to improve in our productivity and efficiency, not only on the back of expansion of revenues that for sure
is going to happen, also for our capacity, demonstrated capacity, to run the costs well below inflation.
On credit quality, I recognize the environment is highly uncertain, but when I look at the balance sheet and the
loan book, well, I feel comfortable that we are ready and prepared to face a more difficult environment with
particularly the one in the consensus – as the consensus is today for the market. It doesn't worry that much, even
in harder scenarios, we are in good position to manage this, given the very nature of the portfolio.
On capital, well, we [ph] may not be (00:30:00) above 12%. I feel that we have [indiscernible] (00:30:06) better
than the average. The impact of the portfolios, the value of our sales portfolios, that has affected the capital
across [indiscernible] (00:30:17) competitors. And at the same time, we continue to be [indiscernible] (00:30:26)
disciplined in our capital allocation.
So, all in all, we expect revenue growth to more than offset cost inflation pressures and the potential increase of
cost of risk and on the back of these improve our profitability and value creation for shareholders. That's all on our
side. So, we remain at your disposal for the questions you may have. Thank you.
I forgot to mention [indiscernible] (00:30:54) have an Investor Day on the very last page on the – probably I forget
because I'm not going to be there. So, on the 28th of February in London, we will have an Investor Day where we
update you on the prospects for the group.
Back to you, Begoña.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We already have some questions in the queue, and the first one is
coming from Ignacio Ulargui Lopez from BNP. Ignacio, please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Ulargui Q
Analyst, BNP Paribas SA
Thanks very much. Thanks for taking my question. José Antonio, not sure if this will be your last results call, but I
wanted to wish you all the best and thank you for the support all these years.
I have two questions on the numbers. One is, on the European loan book, how big has been the repricing of the
asset side so far? Just wanted to get a bit of a sense of where are we standing in terms of the NII uplift that could
come in coming quarters. And also linked to the NII, wanted to understand a bit better what has been the
contribution of the TLTRO in the quarter.
The second question is basically linked to the cost-to-income ratio. You have flagged in your final remarks that
you aim to keep on improving the cost-to-income ratio target, it's going to be a bit high probably for 2022. What
can you do to keep on improving [ph] those (00:32:33), which looks to be, to me, very sticky in terms of growth,
particularly in Latin America? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. In the first question, I mentioned a little bit European loan book. I said that NII expansion is just starting in
Europe, particularly in the [ph] Eurozone (00:32:56). I mentioned that we have, as you know, the Central Banks
have reacted. The [ph] financial (00:33:04) reaction has not been the same across the board in this particular
cycle. Latin American Central Banks reacted first and we saw Brazil going from 2% to 14%, Chile going from 1%
to more than 10%, Mexico reacting along with the Fed, but starting higher levels and UK and US came later, the
European Central – the ECB, being the last one. I forgot to mention Poland that the reaction was one of the first
also.
So, when you go through the different books, I mentioned in the presentation that you've been seeing the impact
of high rates for a while in Brazil and the particular case was negative. And in Chile, that is more complex
because this is a play between inflation and nominal rates, as you know. We saw some reaction coming from UK,
US and Mexico that are not just midway, but somehow midway. Poland is advanced, just like Latin America, you
see the margin expansion and Europe is just starting the loan book, specifically, in the loan book.
Remember, in the quarter, we barely [indiscernible] (00:34:23) other than the new origination and the – some
loans related to [indiscernible] (00:34:33). The mortgage book that everybody follows [indiscernible] (00:34:36) in
September. When the book that repriced in September was repriced with the Euribor in July, that was not that
high compared with the one we have right now. I should say that the big appreciation is going to go along the next
12, 13 months, yeah, so and it's going to be pretty significant, yeah.

So, you asked the TLTRO in the quarter. The number I have in mind is [ph] €60 million, €69 million (00:35:10) or
something like that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
For Spain, yes. For the whole, that's [ph] €216 million to €291 million (00:35:15). For Spain, it's [ph] €160 million
to €170 million (00:35:17).

Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. Okay. So, this is the impact of the TLTRO.
The cost-to-income keep improving. Well, I said in my final remark that naturally the cost-to-income with the
revenue expansion we expect and keeping the cost growing below inflation, naturally this leads to a improvement
in cost-to-income. I do recognize that to reduce nominal costs as we are doing in Europe but CIB is difficult in the
current inflation environment, and probably it's impossible. We need to renew some agreement with the unions
and this is going to put pressure on this cost-to-income, for sure, on the back of higher incomes improve.
But also remember that, well, in South America, some point, with the outlook that we have for Brazil becoming
more constructive on the trends at some point. And in Chile at some point we will start to recover. Overall, I'm
thoroughly, thoroughly confident that the cost-to-income should go down, but you're going to have specific details
on the Investor Day on the relation with the specific targets for this.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Francisco Riquel from Alantra. Francisco, please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about Brazil in particular, first of all, about the NII. You
mentioned in the past presentation that there was two quarter lag between the peak in the SELIC rates and the
trough in NII. Now, I hear from your comments that the NII in Brazil would not grow fast until the third quarter
2023. So, if you can please update the NII dynamics in Brazil and if you can please update on your NII guidance
here as well.

And second in Brazil, it's about asset quality. If you can comment on the unsecured lending for individual. So,
what is – that is still driving NPLs up this quarter. And if you can update on the 4.5% cost of risk guidance for
2022, how much of a deviation, and then what do you see cost of risk normalizing from here and going? Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Let me to give you the big picture on Brazil, and specifically to the question you raised. So, we've been in a
situation in which we've been softening a margin compression off the back of two things, high interest rates that
the balance sheet is [indiscernible] (00:38:23) lower rates. And second, we changed our underwriting standards
back last year in September last year that leads to a change in mix with loan origination in the back end, in the
lower end of the mass market. And these naturally impact the yield of our new origination and the yield of the
portfolio. That's the impact on the NII.
Where are we right now? So, we are now more constructive for two quarters. We've seen the cost of risk in line
with our expectations. So, that means that we are in a position to start to be – to grow a little bit more, little by
little, checking this and start to offset, as José said, to pass through the growth in activity to some growth in NII.
Still, volumes cannot grow faster than NII for a while, but this gap is going to get reduced over time as we reprice
assets in the book, and maybe, at some point, we have confidence in the mix becoming more normalized like –
compared with the one we have today and the one in the past. So, that's the expectation for NII. So, more
constructive, little by little, more activity, more pass-through to NII in December.
The asset quality, José mentioned the 4.5%, 4.6% like at the end of the year, we were guiding you between 4.2%,
4.5%. We are growing particularly in non-individual sector less than expected. Growth has been limited in
corporate sector, I mean, CIB and SMEs where credit quality is good and the denominator push us up a little bit
our expectation on the asset quality, but nothing that we see fundamentally wrong in the vintage as we are
analyzing on the generation in the mass market, in the lowering of the mass market is where we got the problem.
So, all in all, I feel I'm more constructive on the outlook for Brazil. Yeah. So, I think that little by little, we're going
to show these trends, I hope, and show to you in the coming quarters.

Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Good morning. A couple of questions from me. I won't touch on Brazil because I think you've been pretty clear.
But one question on UK, another one on the US. In the UK, you've now raised your [indiscernible] (00:41:40), and
you've got pretty competitive remuneration on – deposit remuneration. When we think about the next few quarters
going forward and considering what's going on in the mortgage market, do you still have capacity to grow the NII?
I'm just thinking the – your overall ability to grow profits in the region given the NII potential headwinds from
11


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
repricing of mortgages, minimum deposit be – sort of minimum deposit sensitivity and obviously the economic
outlook sort of deteriorating. So, maybe an update on the outlook on the UK more thinking about next year?
And the second question on the US, I think you called out – José I think called out the gradual normalization.
Some of your peers have profit warned – some of your competitors in the auto space have profit warned during
the results season. Could you update us as how sort of delinquencies are performing, are we back to normalized
levels and it's just about normalizing secondhand prices? And in that context of normalization, is the 300 basis
points provision charge for 2019 – that you posted in 2019, a reasonable sort of fully normalized provision charge
or what's the fully normalized look like for you? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Alvaro, for your questions. In the UK, you mentioned like 1|2|3. Well, overall in UK, as you know
there is a fairly dynamic and competitive deposit market, yeah. So, we have a large loan book. It's only
mortgages, but mainly mortgages. And while we plan to keep the retail funding in line with the loan book that we
have, for that reason we need to react.
This is – your question goes straight, can you grow the NII having to react to the more dynamic and competitive
deposit market? Yes, I think, we can. José mentioned about the beta. So within that, we still enjoy margin
expansion, understanding that we need to react as we reacted in 1|2|3. But taking into account all of this, I do
expect NII to keep very constructed in the UK and growing nicely in the UK in the coming years.
The market is complex. You know you reprice – you remortgage basically one-third of the mortgage book. In our
case, roughly speaking, €60 billion along the year and while this is going to – may raise some questions, because
all in all it's going to go from 2%, 2.5%, 3% to double of this as of today. And this increase should be more than
enough to – along with the corporate book that reprice faster, should be more than enough to offset the increase
in deposits [indiscernible] (00:45:03) going to happen and is happening, okay. But I see margin expansion next
year in the UK holding out.
In the US, well, your question goes in our P&L in the US, particularly you're referring to the auto sector, what is
happening there is margin expansion on the back of the deposit base of the bank. Fairly competitive market in
prices in the auto space, fairly, fairly competitive, more than I was expecting. And what we are seeing in the cost
of risk, José mentioned that the cost of risk is increasing less than expected.
We have several factors there. One factor that is fairly negative is the leasing, because on the back of the very
high second – used car prices we are not having gains on the disposal of the cars that we have leases as we had
the previous year. And on the other side, because – you mentioned 300 basis points up probably is not going to
be the same than previously. Our book is more prime than used to be. And so, as José said, 80% of the book in
the US is prime, only 20% is subprime. And we do not expect to go back exactly to the levels we had in 2019,
because the mix. It's true that some of our competitors show some increase in rates. I haven't go through the
numbers and knowing – and I don't know if they changed the mix [indiscernible] (00:46:55), but we are not seeing
this. And on the back of this, we are – I feel comfortable. We're fairly, fairly well [indiscernible] (00:47:04) in the
US, yeah. In fact, we reassigned €500 million of provisions that we build for COVID to the new macro scenario.
So, in that regard, normalization will happen. I don't expect to go back to the levels of 2019 just because the mix
overall. But for on a like-for-like basis, it makes sense that at some point we get there. Overall, not due to the mix
but this is going to happen little by little. Now, it is taking longer than we were expecting, yeah.

Sofie Peterzens Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah, Hi. Here is Sofie from JPMorgan. So, my first question would be if you could just repeat the TLTRO NII
benefit. Sorry, I couldn't quite hear that. But then I got a more broadly the question. Sorry, the first one is on
[indiscernible] (00:48:18) growth in Europe. You said you have very strong cost performance in Europe. But how
should we think about the wage agreements coming off also higher investments, higher IT costs, higher general
expenses. So, how should we think about kind of cost growth in Europe going forward?
And then my second question would be, when would you expect cost of risk for Santander to peak? It sounds like
Brazil will still be relatively high cost of risk. US cost of risk is going up. UK cost of risk is trending up. So, how
should we think about the cost of risk to be for Santander and at what level [indiscernible] (00:49:06). Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Begoña Morenés A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. So, let me give you the figures. The group has €88 billion in TLTRO, €60 billion in Spain, €20 billion in
Santander Consumer Finance and €7 billion in Portugal. So you can do the math very easily. Thank you, Sofie.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Cost growth in Europe, the wage agreements. So where are we in different jurisdictions? I should say in Poland
and UK, we've been updating salaries along with inflation. So, I should say BAU, business as usual in Spain and
Portugal where we had agreements for several years. In Spain that is the most important one due to salaries till
the end of 2023 and we are starting to negotiate a new agreement with the union probably mid-2023, okay?
Before that, maybe some minor adjustments, but [indiscernible] (00:50:25) but we expect these unions to be quite
demanding, naturally. And we – difficult to forecast the final agreement, but, well, looking into what has happening
in Spain, wages in 2022 are growing at 2.6%. We are growing wages north of [indiscernible] (00:50:50). And
naturally I do expect the wages in Spain to accelerate a little bit. We've seen the agreement of the government
with the civil servants, roughly speaking 9% for three years. This is a – that – this establishes a kind of benchmark
because it is an agreement for 3 million people or 4 million people. Along these lines I do see having a negotiation
with the unions. So, this is my expectation.
It's going to be possible to match – keep the cost below inflation, I think so, with this kind of agreement, this will be
below inflation and probably growing the cost in the region of 3-percentage-something before efficiencies should
be something – 3% to 4% will be something doable. Overall, in some countries less. In CIB, probably as we are
gaining share and we are expanding the business, probably we're going to grow the costs faster than that,
probably as I mentioned in the presentation or José mentioned in the presentation CIB as the main driver of
13


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
positive cost growth in Europe while the units, the retail units, Spain and Portugal are deeply in nominal negative
growth. So, CIB, I expect to continue to grow faster than the retail units where the transformation is going to go
on. I know [indiscernible] (00:52:24) in the 3%, 4% region for the next couple of years.
Cost of risk peak, difficult to say, yeah. So, the macro, as you know, we are providing due to the macro right now.
We had €1.1 billion due to the macro. Probably overall in the year if the macro remains the same or the scenario
we have remains the same, we're [indiscernible] (00:52:51) this year €1.4 billion. Having this €1.4 billion for this
year because of [indiscernible] (00:52:57) below 1%. If the macro deteriorates further, naturally – if the expected
macro deteriorates further, we may need to increase the cost of risk next year. When it's going to be? Basing on
the consensus should be next year, yeah. So – but naturally difficult to say, yeah. So based on current
expectations, the end of 2023, 2024 is going to be the worst period of – with a significant economic slowdown
being predicted.
Having said that, this is based on the scenario, yeah, the peak. But in any case, our expectation on the cost of
risk is not to have anything close to what we had in the COVID, yeah, so well below this, yeah. So, going up but
not that much. That's our expectation. And with the current scenario going up, but are very much for levels. And
for sure, we are including what I said before, revenues, increasing revenues will offset, more on offsetting
potential increase in ordinary costs and cost of risk.

Carlos Cobo Catena Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (Spain)
Hi. Thank you. Thank you for the presentation. A quick question on the NII sensitivity, please. For Spain and
Europe, you mentioned and you've updated the way you calculate the sensitivities. But could you touch quickly on
where do you see the mix of deposits between, [ph] say it, on (00:54:56) term evolving? And what is the term
deposit beta that you think is reasonable to assume going forward?
And the same thing for Brazil. You've already explained how do you expect the NII to evolve over the following
quarters, but how that compares with the slide, would you show that NII upside – and NII in Brazil is only €100
million. If you can explain or reconcile those two guidance will be helpful. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. NII, since given in Spain – well, currently, almost 100% of deposits are current account, isn't 100% but is
90% something. Yeah. So, gradually, this is going to go from current accounts towards, well, a combination
probably of money market funds, term deposits, some kind of life insurance products. Overall, what this means is,
well, based on the past, this used to have a beta that was between 60% and 80%, yeah, so in relation with the
official rates, and which is the percentage that is going to go to term deposit.
It's difficult to say at this stage. What I said I can say to you in the past, it was a long time ago, yeah, so we have
had negative rates for so long that probably we almost forgot this. We used to have a kind of 30% to 40% current
14


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
accounts with no remuneration. We used to have another 20% to 30% what we call median remuneration that
was kind of a lower sensitivity, and another 30% kind of high sensitivity. Overall, the beta you are using is 25%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
25%, correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
25% for the whole deposit book. This is what we are using, and this is what's embedded in what, José said in
relation with expansion of NII. Naturally, you may see that there are some new factors here, difficult to measure.
So, online deposits is somehow new or the expansion of potential players in online deposit is there. Now, they are
playing. They are the only ones that are offering high rates. I don't know how important is going to be this. If the
rates remain in the 2% or 3% [indiscernible] (00:57:36), it's now going to be the big, if the rates naturally the
higher, the rates go the more impact of this.
You mentioned NII in Brazil, the plus €100 million, the €100 million is a [indiscernible] (00:57:50) like-for-like
taking into the forward rate. The forward rates means for one year. So and what we guide to you is being
constructed every quarter, they pass through from volume growth to NII is going to be highest. That's what we're
telling you. In the overall one year using the forward rates and no volume growth is plus €100 million. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Basically because interest rates just stopped increasing. So obviously, because you have a 12-month lag, it will
be, as we said, we are using end of September figures, 12 months is end of September next year, and you would
only have three months of full repricing of assets and abilities. So, when we look 12 months in advance, the
sensitivities [ph] remain same (00:58:45). If you look beyond the 12 months, obviously, the sensitivity is greater.

Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. The first one is a follow-up on the US, just a
clarification on the cost of risk. Because Antonio mentioned that we won't go to 2019 levels which, if I'm right, is
roughly 310 bps. I think in the past, you've guided for – through the cycle level of 250 bps. Are we going to be
somewhere in between for next year? How do you see that? And also in the US, if you could elaborate as well on
the loan growth expectations, your risk appetite generally for the auto lending business?
15


Banco Santander SA

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
And the second question is on deposits in Europe. You have a loan-to-deposit ratio about 200% in the digital
bank, 115% in the UK. It's true that you've got excess deposits in the Spanish balance sheet, but what are you
going to be doing strategically in terms of deposits? Are you going to be chasing deposits to balance the books in
the digital banks or are you going to be setting the price and are you going to be potentially pushing prices
higher? I think you've already launched a new platform in Germany to gather deposits. So, where do you see the
cost of deposits? If you can give us a little bit more clarity on betas across the different businesses for the next 12
to 18 months.
And just – sorry – very quickly, if the ECB changes the terms of the TLTRO tomorrow, would you be repaying all
your TLTRO funds or you would be holding onto them? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. The last question is the easiest one, depends on the terms. Yeah, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
We are prepared. We were, as you know, planning to repay the full amounts next year. If the terms change and it
no longer makes sense to hold on to those funds, we will repay. We could immediately repay almost in full the
excess liquidity we have today. The liquidity that we've been building to repay next year would let us pay almost in
full that. But again, we need – as José Antonio said, we need to look at the terms.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Marta, going to the other questions, US cost of risk. In 2019, our cost of risk was close to 3%, it was 2.80%
or something like that. Yeah. So, normalization should be lower than that. Yeah. So, on the back of the [ph] miss
(01:01:32). Yeah. The growth in prime and – prime and the Bluestem sale, yeah, so we sold Bluestem where the
cost of risk was extremely high.
And this – we think that this is going to be below the levels on 2019 for these two reasons, yeah. So, you asked
the loan growth. Yeah. Well, loan growth, that we have two sources of origination – two main sources of
origination, and others that are work in progress, yeah. As you say, Stellantis, we are being – I think last month,
our penetration last month, meaning September was our best month ever in penetration in Stellantis, so that
means that we continue our good pace naturally they sell these cars, and this is affecting – the new car sales is
affecting this.
On the traditional subprime space, our appetite, while we went a little bit – we increased a little bit of [ph] FICOs
(01:02:37) and this affects the loan growth, but largely, this is going to depend on the car market. We are trying to
up, and we have some agreements with our OEMs. We already signed Mitsubishi, and we are working with
dealers association in order to sign agreements with them in order to diversify our loan growth. We have appetite
for this type of loans at the right price. Naturally, there are some, as I mentioned, the market is fairly competitive
now and – but we want to grow this provide that we can obtain the profitability we are targeting for this business.
You mentioned – the [ph] buses (01:03:25) in Europe. You rightly said that our loan to deposits is higher than
100% in UK and consumer finance – significantly lower in Spain and somehow in Portugal. What we plan to do in
the consumer finance and the retail consumer bank, we expect to grow significantly. And now, the figures are the
16


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
following. We have a book of roughly speaking, €120 billion loan with a deposit book in the region of €50 billion to
€60 billion. Yeah.
So in the next couple of years, we do expect to add a couple of billions in deposits maybe in the region €20 billion
to €30 billion. These are figures to think about in order to close the gap, not as much, but close the gap between
deposits and – sorry, loans and deposits. We are in a position to do that. As you know, this is a business that we
have more or less advanced deposit platforms in several countries, in Germany, Netherlands, also some in
Belgium.
And in the past, we were active in deposits also in the Nordic countries, and we are reactivating this in order to
increase the percentage of funding coming from deposits in this business. We are in a good position to do that
and we think we're going to be successful on this.
In the other markets, I already elaborated in UK where we plan to keep grow in line assets and liabilities and
wealth. And that's the reason we think our beta is higher in the UK than it is in the Spain because [ph] this position
(01:05:20). Basically that's it.

Analyst, CaixaBank BPI
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. And [indiscernible] (01:05:46) to José for his last
presentation. It was a pleasure throughout these years. So my question was actually on NII in Spain. So, my
question would actually be on NII in Spain. So, you gave the sensitivity to a stable interest rate scenarios, but I
was wondering if you could complement that with the sensitivity to further hikes, considering that [ph] next
provision (01:06:06) is that we will get some additional hikes this week and possibly before year-end?
And then, finally, on NII in Poland, I was wondering what type of evolution do you expect going forward and
whether you think there could be some margin compression, given the higher deposit costs, as the political
pressure on that front seems to be mounting? Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Carlos, as I said, these analyses that we showed here is consistent with a previous one, in which we showed that
the sensitivity in Spain to 100 basis points is €750 million, so that sensitivity to additional increases over the
forward rates; in Spain only, not in the Eurozone, which obviously is higher.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Well, NII in Poland, you've seen a – I will say, a very significant margin expansion on the back of increasing rates
[indiscernible] (01:07:11) we enjoyed the cheapest funding cost in Poland. Naturally, additional margin expansion
probably is going to be difficult, but I remain comfortable that we can keep the NIM, the net interest margin going
17


Banco Santander SA

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
around the levels we are having on the back of repricing assets, although we do recognize that the liabilities cost,
we should pay more for deposits, given our position being the less – having the lower funding costs in the market.
So – but, probably, working with an assumption of NIM being around where it is, is a fair assumption to me. Yeah.

Pamela Zuluaga Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Hello. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. The first one is on the provisioning outlook.
You've now built a €1.1 billion overlay, yet you've been mentioning that you have not seen a significant
deterioration in credit quality across the majority of your footprints. You've flagged also that consensus sees cost
of risk peaking next year. However, how are you thinking then about the timing to either use or release these
provisions? Are you expecting to allocate some of these provisions to keep some stability in cost of risk in 2023?
Then, a question on capital optionality. You have managed to build capital above your target, now to 12.10%
CET1. Would you be open to increasing your current 40% payout, or is there a particular headwind that you're
foreseeing and, therefore, you're deciding to be more cautious?
And then, if I may, one follow-up. Can you give us some color on specifically the ABs negotiations with the trade
unions to address the loss of purchasing power in Spain? I understand the last meeting was on Friday. Have we
heard anything about the proposals from the unions, and what would this mean specifically for the cost inflation in
Spain? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Pamela. [indiscernible] (01:09:43) we are providing based on expected losses, and you are asking me
about the use of this overlay. Naturally, we are providing with a scenario. This scenario we are providing is a
scenario that sees some mild recession in some countries in 2023, more towards the end of 2023. So, if this
materializes and our models are right, in theory, we will use this provision. Okay. If we are wrong one way or
another, we may be in a situation, if the scenario deteriorates further, and in 2024 the scenario is worse than the
one we are expecting, we keep building, the other way around is releasing.
So, everything is based on, is our scenario is right? Our scenario is not far away from that, just to understand
among us, yeah, not far from away from that that says that, second part of 2022, you'll see some recession. And
in that case, we will use the €1.1 billion we already build and the extra €300 million we expect to build from now till
the end of the year. But this is – again, this is based on the materialization of this scenario [indiscernible]
(01:11:04) scenario goes into 2024.
Capital optionality. Well, we stated clear that the board – when the board approved 40%, expressed the idea of
going to 50% at some point. So, is a decision that the board is going – is up to the board and is not a decision
taking. Having said that, I said in the presentation that, within that, the 12% is an appropriate level for us and we'll
keep building capital.

AB negotiations. Yeah. While there have been some negotiations about kind of one-off for the employees or some
employees or the employees this year, aside from the negotiation from the unions in the future. Yeah. So, this is
not going to be a – this is not going to substitute the big negotiation that is the one who matters in terms of cost.
This one is more about some compensation, but small one. And this is not a negotiation of the full agreement with
the unions that will come, as I said before, start in 2023 – mid-2023.

Thank you. And thank you, Pamela. Can we have the last question, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Yes. The last question is coming from Fernando Gil de Santivañes from Bestinver. Fernando, please
go ahead.

Fernando Gil de Santivañes d´Ornellas Q
Analyst, Bestinver Securities
Thank you for taking my questions. Couple of questions, please. First one on Spain. What is your view on the
potential impact that you may have if there's a change [indiscernible] (01:12:52) good practices on those
vulnerable, the families that might be implemented? This is one.
Second, on Poland and the payment holidays provision that you have done, are you forecasting or seeing any
more coming in the next quarter?
And finally, if you can comment a little bit on the ALCO strategy and the mix that you have in the Spanish
portfolio, that will be great. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. In Spain, well, I should say that this agreement, the way we match vulnerable customers that have a
mortgage with us is – I should say, is business as usual. The agreement we try to reach is, which are the ways
[indiscernible] (01:13:45) match this. Yeah. So – and the ways, I should say, we are discussing is, business as
usual. And naturally, the extra provisions, if any, are embedded in our macro scenario. Naturally, the macro
scenario when it comes to mortgages contemplate that we are a mortgage book and the capacity of the
customers to repay, the affordability, the loan-to-value, and all these things.
If these deteriorate as a result of the higher inflation and lower disposable income, this is already included debt.
So, I do not need to change anything, because we change this, because it's supposed to be included in our
expected scenario. Naturally, if the expected scenario is worse, the most sensitive issue here is unemployment.
Yeah. So, unemployment is the key. Because when I look at the real estate market in Spain, it's not, in any
dimension, overvalued. Yeah. So it's not the case that we had, I don't know, 14 or 15 years ago. It's more a
question of affordability ratios for those customers in the low end, with low income or medium to low income, with
high affordability ratios that suffered in the disposable income, it's more of this. But is included, as I said, in our
macro scenario.
Poland. On payment holidays, we need to see, yeah, what's going on. Yeah. So, we think we've done, I don't
know, all, or at least the majority of the provisions. In any case, well, if we're going to assess how many
customers come to claim the payment holidays and we adjust accordingly to this. It's not – I expect not to be

significant, but maybe we need to add more. We will see quarter-on-quarter, if we need to add more. Having said
that, the revenue generation of the bank and operating profit that the banks generate, and as I said before to a
question of one of your colleagues, I feel very constructive that we want to keep relatively, or very high NII that
allow us to face potential higher requirements from the payment holidays.
ALCO strategy, I don't know if I should pass while we start to build our portfolio little by little. So, it's more to do.
José, do you want to elaborate on this?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. As we mentioned in the first half results presentation, we didn't have an ALCO portfolio at the time in euros
which, obviously, was a conscious decision that cost us some net interest income compared to our competitors
but, obviously, put us in a much better position in terms of balance sheet value and the opportunity to read the
ALCO portfolio going forward. We have today €6.5 billion already. In the Eurozone, we are building the portfolio
through a diversified [indiscernible] (01:16:58) through diversified countries, not only Spain. We have France, we
have Italy. And we would gradually continue building the portfolio over the next, probably, two years. We don't
have a figure in mind, but clearly, we have an opportunity to rebuild the portfolio earning more than 3% yield,
which is what we have so far in the €6.5 billion. We will make purchases again depending on the opportunities
that we see. But again, from €6.5 billion today, gradually growing to a much larger figure over the next couple of
years.

José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, guys. Thank you for all these years following this results presentation. I tried yesterday to count
the number of times [indiscernible] (01:17:52) and I got a number of 72 times in the last 19 years. Yeah. So, good
luck, guys, and keep following Santander. There is always an interest in equity story and we see improving
profitability going forward. Thank you. This is my last message to you. And good luck, guys. Bye.
