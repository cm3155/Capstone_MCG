Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to
announce our first quarter results, which Zach will detail later. Huntington is very well positioned. We operate a
diversified franchise with disciplined risk management. Our approach to both our colleagues and customers is
grounded in our purpose to make people's lives better, help businesses thrive, and strengthen the communities
we serve. And during times like these, Huntington's purpose is evident in how we look out for each other and
serve as a source of strength for our customers and communities.
Now on to slide 4. These are the key messages I want to highlight to you. First, we have one of the strongest
deposit franchises of any regional bank. We have a diversified base of primary bank customer relationships,
which has been built over many years, supported by our Fair Play philosophy. We also have the leading
percentage of insured deposits as of year-end.
Second, we maintain a robust liquidity position consistent with our long-standing approach to conservative risk
management practices. Third, our capital base is solid and building, common equity Tier 1 has increased for three
quarters in a row, and we intend to continue to build to the high-end of our range. Fourth, our credit reserves are
top tier. Credit quality continues to perform exceptionally well and remains a hallmark of our disciplined credit
management.
Fifth, we are dynamically managing through the current environment, bolstering capital and liquidity. We're also
incrementally optimizing the balance sheet and loan growth while continuing to proactively manage the expense
base. Finally, we are well-positioned to operate through uncertainty with a focus on our long-term strategy and our
commitment to top quartile returns. I believe Huntington is built to thrive during times like this, and ultimately to
benefit and to capture opportunities as they arise. Moments of market disruption present opportunities to take
market share, to win new customers, and to hire great talent. We are confident in our strategy and strong position.
Moving on to slide 5, we enter this period of disruption in the best position the company has been since I've joined
over a dozen years ago. The reputation our colleagues have created of best-in-class customer service results in
customer confidence and trust in us. The 2023 J.D. Power Award for Customer Satisfaction reflects our
colleagues' efforts.
Grounded in our Fair Play philosophy, we continue to acquire and deepen primary bank relationships, resulting in
our granular and diversified deposit base.
For many years, we focused on gathering deposits that are sticky operating accounts and proactively placed
larger deposits off balance sheet. We continue to invest across the franchise to drive deposit growth. We are also
incrementally optimizing loan growth to generate the highest returns and ensure the capital we deploy is put to the
highest and best use, and we remain focused on delivering the revenue synergies we previously shared,
accelerating the growth of our fee businesses and deepening our customer relationships.
In regards to capital, CET1 increased 19 basis points from the prior quarter to 9.55%, and we plan to build capital
to the high end of our range over the course of 2023. Our credit reserves are top tier in the peer group at 1.9%.
We will continue to be proactive in our expense management. In the first quarter, we completed a number of
actions to support our ongoing efficiency programs, such as the 31 branch consolidations, the voluntary
retirement program, and our organizational realignment with reductions in personnel. And in addition to Operation
Accelerate, we have a roadmap to deliver continued efficiencies going forward. Importantly, risk management is

embedded within all our business lines. At Huntington everyone owns risk and we continue to operate within our
aggregate moderate to low risk appetite.
Finally, I want to reiterate, Huntington is built for times like this. We have a strong, well-diversified franchise with a
distinctive brand and loyal customers. Our high quality deposit base, robust liquidity, and solid credit metrics, are
the direct result of focused and disciplined execution over many years. We have an experienced management
team supported by highly engaged colleagues executing on our strategy. And as you know, management is
collectively a top 10 shareholder, and we are fully committed to driving top tier performance and growing
shareholder value.
Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.

Zachary J. Wasserman
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our first quarter results. We reported
GAAP earnings per common share of $0.39 and adjusted EPS of $0.38. Return on tangible common equity, or
ROTCE, came in at 23.1% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 22.7%. Further adjusting for
AOCI, ROTCE was 17.8%. Pre-provision net revenue expanded 41% year-over-year to $844 million. Loan
balances continued to grow as total loans increased by $1.5 billion from the prior quarter. Liquidity coverage
remains robust, with over $60 billion of available liquidity, representing a peer leading coverage of uninsured
deposits of 136%. Credit quality remains strong, with net charge-offs of 19 basis points and allowance for credit
losses of 1.9%.
Turning to slide 7, average loan balances increased 1.3% quarter-over-quarter, driven by commercial loans,
which increased by $1.5 billion or 2.2% from the prior quarter. Primary components of this commercial growth
included distribution finance, which increased $800 million, tied to continued normalization of dealer inventory
levels, as well as seasonality with shipments of spring equipment arriving to dealers. Corporate and specialty
banking increased $242 million, primarily driven by growth in Mid-Corp. healthcare and tech and telecom.
Other asset finance businesses contributed growth of $216 million. Auto floorplan continued normalization, with
balances higher by $214 million. Business banking also increased $92 million. In consumer, growth continued to
be led by residential mortgage, which increased by $316 million. Partially offsetting this growth were home equity
balances, which declined by $159 million. All other categories, including RV/marine and auto, declined by a
collective $123 million.
Turning to slide 8, we continued to deliver average deposit growth in the first quarter. Balances were higher by
$472 million, primarily driven by consumer, which more than offset lower commercial balances. On a year-over-
year basis average deposits increased by $3.2 billion or 2.3%.
Turning to slide 9, I want to share more details behind Huntington's deposit franchise. Our deposit base
represents a leading percentage of insured deposits at 69% as of Q1. Our deposit base is highly diversified, with
consumer deposits representing over half of our total deposits and the average consumer balance being $11,000.
Turning to slide 10, complementing our diversified deposit base is the stability and growth of our deposits over
time. During last year, we consistently delivered deposit growth well above peer levels despite the backdrop of
rising rates and quantitative tightening. Through year-end 2022, cumulative deposit growth was 2.4%, nearly 6
percentage points better than the peer median.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Over the course of Q1, monthly average deposit balances were stable at approximately $146 billion. Within
consumer deposits, balances have increased for four months in a row. Total commercial balances were modestly
lower, consistent with expected seasonality. During March, in addition to seasonality, commercial customers also
incrementally utilized our off balance sheet liquidity solutions.
Turning to slide 11, we have a sophisticated approach to customer liquidity management that comprises both on-
balance sheet deposit products as well as off-balance sheet alternatives. Over the past four years, we have
invested substantially to build out these solutions to ensure we're managing our customers' overall liquidity needs.
The enhanced liquidity solutions allow us to manage the full customer relationship with primary bank and
operating deposits on-balance sheet and utilizing our off-balance sheet solutions for investments or non-
operational funds.
Over the course of 2020 and 2021, we intentionally leveraged these off balance sheet solutions in order to
support our customers' excess liquidity. This resulted in fewer surge deposits coming on sheet, as well as less
commercial deposit runoff during 2022 compared to the industry. On a year-over-year basis, our commercial
banking segment on-balance sheet deposits increased 11%, and our off-balance sheet liquidity balances
increased 54%.
During March, this approach yet again showed its value for both Huntington and our customers. We saw
customers moving a modest amount of deposit balances into treasuries and other products, while we were able to
maintain those primary operating accounts on our balance sheet. Of the total change in commercial segment
deposit balances between March 6 and the end of Q1, we estimate that approximately half the delta was
attributable to normal seasonality and the remainder was mainly the result of shifts into our off-balance sheet
solutions. The bottom table highlights these movements as well as trends in the first two weeks of April. On-
balance sheet deposits have returned to the March 6 level and off-balance sheet continues to grow.
Turning to slide 12, our liquidity capacity is robust. Our two primary sources of liquidity, cash and borrowing
capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve represented $10 billion and $51 billion, respectively, at the end of Q1.
As part of our ongoing liquidity management, we continually seek to maximize contingent borrowing capacity. And
as of April 14, our total cash and available borrowing capacity increased to $65 billion. At quarter end, this pool of
available liquidity represented 136% of total uninsured deposits, a pure leading coverage.
On to slide 13. For the quarter, net interest income decreased by $53 million or 4% to $1.418 billion, driven by
lower day count and lower net interest margin. Year-over-year NII increased $264 million or 23%. Net interest
margin decreased 12 basis points on a GAAP basis from the prior quarter and decreased 11 basis points on a
core basis excluding accretion. The reduction in GAAP NIM included 5 basis points from lower spreads net of free
funds due to funding mix and marginally accelerated interest costs. It also included 5 basis points from the first
substantive negative carry impact from our long-term down rate NIM hedging program, and 3 basis points from
higher cash levels.
Slide 14 highlights our ongoing disciplined management of deposit costs and funding. For the current cycle to
date, our beta on total cost of deposits was 25%. As we've noted, we expect deposit rates to continue to trend
higher from here over the course of the rate cycle. Given the recent market environment, at the margin, we do
expect a steeper near-term trajectory.
Turning to slide 15, our hedging program is dynamic, continually optimized, and well-diversified. Our objectives
are to protect capital in up rate scenarios and to protect NIM in down rate scenarios. During the first quarter, we
5


Huntington Bancshares, Inc.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
added to the hedge portfolio with both of these objectives in mind. On the capital protection front, we added $1.6
billion in additional pay fixed swaps and $1.5 billion in forward starting pay fixed swaptions.
Throughout the quarter, we were deliberate in managing the balance sheet to benefit from asset sensitivity. We
also incrementally added to our hedge position, to manage possible downside rate risks over the longer term, as
well as took actions to optimize the near-term cost of the program. During the quarter, we executed a net $400
million of receive-fixed swaps, terminated $4.9 billion of swaps, and entered into $5 billion of floor spreads. As
we've noted before, our intention is to manage NIM in a tighter corridor as possible, as we protect the downside
and maintain upside potential if rates stay higher for longer.
Turning to slide 16, on our securities portfolio we saw another step up in reported yields quarter-over-quarter. We
benefited from higher reinvestment yields as well as our hedges to protect capital. From a portfolio strategy
perspective, we expect to continue to add to the allocation of shorter duration exposures to benefit from the
inverted yield curve and further enhance the liquidity profile of the portfolio. You will note that fair value marks at
the end of March were lower than year-end, both in the AFS and HTM portfolios as market interest rates moved
lower sequentially. Importantly, we have also shown a $700 million total positive, fair value mark from our pay
fixed hedges, which are intended to protect capital.
Moving on to slide 17, non-interest income was $512 million, up $13 million from last quarter. These results
include the $57 million gain on the sale of our retirement plan services business during the quarter. Excluding that
gain, adjusted non-interest income was $455 million. This result was somewhat lower than the guidance we
provided in early March, driven by lower capital markets revenues given the disruptions at the end of Q1. The first
quarter is generally a seasonal low for fee revenues. As we've noted previously, we see Q1, excluding the RPS
sale, being the low point and for fees to grow over the course of the year, driven by solid underlying performance
in our key areas of strategic focus, capital markets, payments and wealth management.
Moving on to slide 18, GAAP non-interest expense increased by $9 million. Adjusted for notable items, core
expenses decreased by $18 million, driven by lower personnel expense, primarily as a result of reduced
incentives and revenue driven compensation. We're proactively managing expenses and have taken actions over
the last several quarters to orient to a low level of expense growth in order to deliver positive operating leverage
and self-fund strategic investments.
Slide 19 recaps our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 increased to 9.55% and has increased sequentially for
three quarters. OCI impacts to Common Equity Tier 1 resulted in an adjusted CET1 ratio of 7.6%. As a reminder,
the reported regulatory capital framework does not include OCI impacts in the capital calculation. Our tangible
Common Equity Ratio, or TCE, increased 22 basis points to 5.77%. Note that we were holding higher cash
balances at the end of Q1 which reduced the TCE ratio by 13 basis points. Adjusting for AOCI, our TCE ratio was
7.27%. Tangible book value per share increased by 7% from the prior quarter to $7.32. Adjusting for AOCI,
tangible book value increased to $9.23 and has increased for the past four quarters.
Our capital management strategy for the balance of 2023 will result in expanding capital over the course of the
year, while maintaining our top priority to fund high return loan growth. We intend to grow CET1 to the top end of
our 9% to 10% operating range by the end of the year. We believe this is a prudent approach given the dynamic
environment. Based on our expectation for continued loan growth, we do not expect to utilize the share
repurchase program during 2023.
Turning to slide 20, our capital plus reserve is top quartile in the peer group and gives us substantial total loss
absorption capacity. On slide 21, credit quality continues to perform very well. As mentioned, net charge-offs were
6


Huntington Bancshares, Inc.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
19 basis points for the quarter. This was higher than last quarter by 2 basis points and up 12 basis points from the
prior year as charge-offs continued to normalize. Non-performing assets declined from the previous quarter and
have reduced for seven consecutive quarters. Allowance for credit losses was flat at 1.9% of total loans.
Turning to slide 22, we have provided incremental disclosures on our commercial real estate balances. This
portfolio is well-diversified and at 14% of total loans is in line with the peer group with no outsized exposures. The
majority of the property types are multifamily and industrial. Over the last two years, we have grown our CRE
book at a slower pace relative to the industry and peers. We remain conservative in our credit approach to CRE,
with rigorous client selection. Total office CRE comprises less than 2% of total loans and the majority are
suburban and multi-tenant properties. Reserve coverage on our total CRE portfolio is 3% and the office portfolio is
8%.
Let's turn to our 2023 outlook on slide 23. As we have discussed, we analyzed multiple potential economic
scenarios to project financial performance and develop management action plans. We also remain dynamic in the
current environment as we execute on our strategies. Our guidance is anchored on a baseline scenario that is
informed by the consensus economic outlook. We have also based our guidance on a range of interest rate
scenarios, bounded on the low end using the forward curve as of the end of March, to one at the higher end
where rates are higher for longer, with Fed funds remaining at approximately today's level over the rest of the
year.
On loans, our outlook range continues to be growth between 5% and 7% on an average basis. And as before, we
expect this growth to be led by commercial, with more modest growth in consumer. As we entered the year, we
were trending to the middle, to higher portion of that growth range. Given the market disruption and our
incremental focus on optimizing loan growth for the highest returns on capital, we now expect to be in the lower
half to midpoint of this range.
On deposits, we are guided by our core strategy of acquiring and deepening primary bank relationships. We're
narrowing our outlook with a slightly lower top end of the range and still expect to grow average deposits between
1% and 3%. However, the composition of deposit growth from here, we now expect to be primarily consumer led,
with relatively less commercial growth. Net interest income is now expected to increase between 6% and 9%.
This is driven by slightly lower loan growth and marginally higher funding costs. Non-interest income on a core full
year basis is expected to be flat to down 2%. The updated guidance reflects modestly lower expected growth in
capital markets fees and includes the go-forward impact of the RPS business sale. As noted, we expect Q1 to be
the low point for fees growing over the course of the year, led by capital markets payments and wealth
management.
On expenses, we are proactively managing with a posture to keep underlying core expense growth at a very low
level. We're benefiting from our ongoing efficiency initiatives, such as Operation Accelerate, branch optimization,
the voluntary retirement program, and the organizational realignment, providing the capacity to self-fund
sustained investment in our key growth initiatives. Given a somewhat lower revenue outlook, we are taking
actions to incrementally reduce the expense growth in 2023.
For the full year, we now expect core expense growth between 1% and 3%, plus the incremental expenses from
the full year run rate of Capstone and Torana and the increased FDIC insurance expense. Overall, our low
expense growth, coupled with expanded revenues, is expected to support another year of positive operating
leverage. We continue to expect net charge-offs will be on the low end of our long-term through the cycle range of
25 to 45 basis points.

Finally, turning to slide 24, as you heard from Steve, the foundation we have built at Huntington over the last
decade has created an institution that is well-prepared for this environment. We will leverage the strength of our
deposit base. We're focused on growing capital and maintaining robust liquidity. We remain disciplined in our
credit posture, and we're executing our core strategy. The work we have done to build the franchise positions
Huntington to outperform and be ready to opportunistically seize on pockets of growth. We will remain disciplined
and dynamic in our management approach as we continue to generate long-term value for our shareholders.
With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to Q&A. Tim, over to you.

As I look through your deposit flows for the quarter, you've clearly done better than peers, whether it's on total
deposits or even just non-interest bearing deposits. Can you break out what you saw in the background? Was
there a lot of movement with new accounts coming in and some of those existing commercial clients moving off-
balance sheet? And if so, can you talk about how sticky you think some of those new account openings are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Manan. This is Zach. I'll take that question, and it's a good one. Overall, what we saw in our deposit base
during the quarter was tremendous stability. And that continued not only through the month of March but into early
April. And we've tried to provide some incremental disclosures about that so we could get the visibility.
And for us, it's not surprising, as we've noted quite a bit. It's very granular, very diversified, and overall, it didn't
happen by accident, it's a function of a really long strategy we have to focus on primary bank relationships as you
know, and to develop this commercial off-balance sheet capability that we described in the prepared remarks.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
To get to your question in particular, what we saw generally – I would note, by the way, that when you're looking
at balances on a day-by-day basis as we've provided them in that disclosure, you have to take them with a note of
caution. It really matters what day of the week, what week of the month, etcetera, with payroll days and tax
payments, etcetera. Generally, we expect the end of March to be a seasonal low for commercial. And so most of
the movement, around half of the movement we saw in commercial from let's say the average of March down to
the end of March was really just BAU movements of commercial clients largely paying out payroll.
The other half was largely movements of deposits off balance sheet as very marginal amount of customers use
those off-balance sheet solutions to leverage that product set. Interestingly, what you can see is, by this
disclosure out into the first two weeks of April is that essentially it came back in terms of the overall balance of
commercial deposits. So it's very stable, virtually no movement.
On the question of what we saw ins and out, we of course saw some acquisition and we continue to acquire in
every segment that we're operating in, consumer [indiscernible] (00:28:46), business banking and commercial as
well. And so, we feel good about that kind of long-term program, which is one of the things that underlies our
continued expectation for deposits growth throughout the rest of this year, just continuing to stay on a strategy of
acquiring and deepening our primary bank relationships.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. And then, just separately, can you talk about the funding and liquidity side of the balance sheet? So,
despite the low level of deposit outflow, I think you built up some cash and liquidity levels by taking on more
wholesale funding. So how should we think about that as we get through the rest of this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. In terms of overall funding mix, we've talked about this a number of times in prior quarters, we really like
where we're coming to this rate cycle from a perspective of lots of balance options to fund the business. We're
growing loans at this point between 5% and 7%, and deposits were between 1% and 3%, around 2%, call it, the
midpoint of that range. So that allows us to also leverage other sources of funding to overall fund the balance
sheet and we're in a great position to be able to do that.
I will tell you, internally we really like that. It creates quite a bit of tension in the system of where the next unit of
funding is coming, and really it is optimized from the economic perspective. And so, our expectation is to continue
to essentially add to each of those funding categories over the foreseeable future, while still maintaining a level
that's comparatively quite good relative to history for us. So, that's the overall plan.
On the topic of liquidity, I would just note a couple of things. This is a key risk that the company has been focused
on managing for more than a decade. We purposely create exceptionally robust pools of contingent liquidity to
cover any potential issue. I think we noted in the deck some of the key sources of liquidity, and also whether that
we continue to over time add to them.
I will tell you that one of the statistics that's in the document today highlights $65 billion of contingent cash and
borrowing capacity as of last Friday. I'm pleased to report that as of this morning, there's an incremental effort
we've done now $84 billion, which in total represents 187% relative to our insured deposits. So exceptionally
strong liquidity profile and, as I said, kind of very balanced funding base.

You mentioned the actions you've taken incrementally to lower expense growth across the firm. Are those actions
factored into your 1% to 3% expense guidance? And also what are those actions involved? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. It's a great question, John. This is Zach. I'll elaborate on that. So the short answer to your question is, yes.
Our guidance of 1% to 3% underlying core growth includes those actions. And I think, just back to the sort of
strategic intent of it, as we've said, for a while we are very intent on driving a low level of overall expense growth
and really leveraging our ongoing program of efficiency initiatives to do that, even while we continue to drive
outsized growth and self-fund investments within that overall low growth framework.
And so, as we came into this updated guidance period where we saw somewhat lower revenue trajectory, for us it
was important kind of continue to execute on the discipline of driving the positive operating leverage, but also
ratchet down expenses. I think the kind of things that we do, we always enter the year with a contingent set of
expense management options, a menu you could think about it, of different kind of options we could undertake if
we needed to. And that's essentially what we're going to go through now.
We'll modulate the pace of hiring. We'll be very judicious in the discretionary expense categories, and we will look
at sort of every possible area of expense control to ratchet back expenses and offset a good amount of what was
otherwise profit revenue pressures. So, that's the playbook and something we've done numerous times over the
course of years. And so, we feel really good about it and we're executing it now.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Okay. Great. All right. Thanks. And then on the – back to the balance sheet, can you just give us your expectation
in terms of an updated through cycle deposit beta? I believe you had expected 35% previously. But if you can
update us there on what you're thinking and also what net interest margin outlook is baked into your up 6% to 9%
net interest income projection. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
You got it, John. Let me elaborate more on that. Overall – pulling back, overall, the strategy we have is to
continue to drive sustained growth in net interest income in dollar basis and to do that driving continual growth
and high return in all categories, coupling that with the management of NIM around a tighter corridor as we can,
with the top end benefits from our continued asset sensitivity. And we said that's really benefited [indiscernible]
(00:34:58) a lot higher for longer, but also at the lower end protected with our hedge portfolio. All that adds up to
the 6% to 9% NII growth that we've guided to.
On beta, and particularly to answer your question, it clearly is a more competitive environment, and hence it's
realistic to expect some higher beta, and slightly an earlier impact than we had previously seen. I do expect now a
few percentage points higher than the original – than the prior guidance of 35% beta.
I will note that we provide prior guidance on beta, because we want to give you an indication of where we think
that's going. But for us, the most important thing is the execution day to day of driving the deposit growth and
staying incredibly disciplined in terms of the overall funding mix, as I noted in my prior response. How beta
ultimately plays out here over the end game is going to be clearly a function of where this yield curve goes. But I
do think that a few percent higher than 35% is a reasonable range based on the two scenarios I laid out.
In terms of overall spread, as we noted, we've moved the guidance range from – it was previously 8% to 11% to
6% to 9%, so down about 2% in terms of that guidance range. About 40% of that is just slightly lower loan growth
and the rest is spread. As I think about the kind of the way the year plays out, I would expect that a more
frontloaded impact of spreads than we were previously expecting, so we would expect to see $1 decline in NII in
Q2, about the same as we saw in Q1, but then growing from there. And I think the NIM range that we have there
is sort of consistent with that dollar trend.

Good morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Two questions. One, in terms of the deposit growth outlook, I think you mentioned it's expected to be more
consumer-led. Just give us a sense of strategically how either the interest rate environment or the events of the
last month have changed? How you are thinking about deposit acquisition and has it materially changed the
pricing on a new deposit growth relative to how we thought about it back in January?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Ebrahim. Overall, I would say, as we noted, we've tightened the range with a kind of a lower top
end, but still expect growth pretty consistent with what we have thought before in terms of the overall
[indiscernible] (00:38:01) growth, so we still see nice traction and I think you'd see that a little bit in some of the
disclosures we've given just in the first weeks of April, for example.
With that being said, I think the mix will be different and we now expect commercial to be largely flat from here,
and really the growth to be consumer-led. Frankly, from our perspective, it's a great highlight of the strength of the
consumer franchise that we've got that we can lean in down and continue to support high profit loan growth with
that consumer funding.
I think the dust has not settled in terms of all of the competitive and customer behavioral impacts of the last
month, but I think one of them will prove to be more moderated commercial growth and we'll just be deleveraging
the off-balance sheet structures that much more to ensure that what we do have on sheet is incredibly stable.
And on the consumer side, just running the same playbook that we have. We have invested so much over the last
few years in capabilities to build our marketing technology and customer targeting capability within the consumer
that we really have the opportunity now to optimize and to drive incremental consumer-oriented acquisition
[indiscernible] (00:39:17) but just fundamentally we're growing – we noted a 2% growth in very, very big
relationships on the consumer side, 4% growth in business banking. And so it's a very balanced source of growth
and we're just going to lean into [indiscernible] (00:39:34) overall fund the balances.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just as a follow-up, I guess, on the lending side, so appreciate your comments in terms of where the
growth has been and the outlook. But if you could give us a sense of just customer sentiment given your business
mix, some of the legacy TCF businesses, just the health of the economy in terms of when you speak to your
customers, are you seeing a slowdown in demand also occurring at the same time which increases the likelihood
of a potential downturn and a recession based on what you're seeing?

Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Ebrahim, this is Steve. And thank you for the question. We are seeing customers become more cautious, in some
cases deferring investments and/or postponing acquisitions or other transactions. And this has increased during
the quarter. It's one of the reasons we've sort of guided without changing the loan range to the lower end of that
loan range from where we would've been at the upper end of that loan range at the end of 2022. There's clearly
more angst about, is there a recession and what will 2024 look. Having said that, many of these customers are
doing quite well in 2023 thus far and remain optimistic. But again, there's been a lot of media, a lot of headline
noise, and it's having an impact in addition to what the Fed's doing.

Hi, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Zach, I was hoping you could – hey. Zach, I was hoping you could expand upon some of the NII comments from a
question or so ago. So, I think if I interpreted you correctly, I guess NII will take a step down in the second quarter.
What would cause the margin or NII to start expanding from there in light of, I guess, fairly limited overall balance
sheet growth through the remainder of the year? Just curious about the nuances as you see them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I think mainly it's going to be volume from there, Scott. Just continue to sequentially grow loans from
second into third and third into fourth quarter is the primary driver that we see spreads much more flat in the back
half and then kind of accelerated in fact. What I just maybe elaborating a little bit on the NIM trajectory that we
13


Huntington Bancshares, Inc.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
see, nothing overly precise. We walked into the year, we were expecting, frankly, a pretty ratable trend in NIM
over the course of the year.
I think at that time we provided some guidance around single-digit basis points to kind of trajectory throughout the
course of the year, but most of that we now see kind of frontloaded just based on the shape of the curve and kind
of how the outlook has shaped up at this point. So that's really the driver. Overall, my outlook for NIM is maybe 5
or 6 basis points lower on a full year basis to give you a sense, a portion of which is yield, but most of which is just
funding costs being slightly higher.

Scott, so remember, we are a large equipment finance lender and that generally has much more activity in the
fourth quarter. That's part of this second half build that Zach referenced.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then can you guys speak broadly to some of the trends you're seeing in the auto
portfolio? I mean, I know your portfolio, just given the quality and tenure of it, it tends to be a lot different than the
industry as a whole. But at least in the media, you would think that the industry is sort of collapsing, I guess. Just
curious that top level trends or appetite from you guys and then what you're seeing at sort of overall?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, Scott. This is Rich, I'll take that and then Zach or Steve can tack on to it. So from my standpoint on the
current side, as we showcased during Investor Day, I mean, this is really a business we like through all sorts of
cycles. I mean, it has become truly a core competency of the bank. If you look at what we saw in the first quarter,
it was a continued gradual normalization in both delinquencies and charge-offs, but it's still trending well below the
historic losses that we would normally see. It was 14 basis points in the first quarter, up from 12 in the fourth
quarter.
From my standpoint, I looked really closely at the origination metrics that we've got, we're still originating at FICOs
north of 780 and the longer values are remaining relatively constant reflecting a little bit more mix in new versus
new. So from my standpoint, we're going to expect this portfolio to continue to showcase our best loss
performance. And unemployment rates are still low, which is certainly going to help the credit metrics here. That's
the big driver of losses. So I'm feeling good about it. And maybe Zach can talk about the optimization that we've
got from a return on capital standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. I'll just tack onto that. I've said in the comments that [indiscernible] (00:45:02) feel great about the trajectory
of the portfolio. We still see sustained demand and great relationships by way of our dealers. So I think we're a
core digital funding partner for the deals which really gives us great access.

In terms of our position, that is one of the other loan categories that we are actively modulating. We had detailed
this in Investor Day last November, I'm sure you remember, but that's the business that is so effectively managed
with respect to pricing and volume trade-offs so we can really pull those levers quite effectively to drive higher
returns and higher yields at times that we need to, this is certainly one of them. And so we're bringing back
production of it and seeing really strong returns as a result of it. So we'll see some of that [indiscernible]
(00:45:55) as we go forward for the rest of the year. But net-net, it's totally an important business for us and we're
pleased with the trends that we see.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I just had one follow-up question for Steve. So Steve, your starting point of CET1 is 9.5%, you accrete about 20
basis points of capital or more in a quarter. And like you said, your allowance already account for a tougher
economic environment. I think your shareholders absolutely appreciate the focus on returns. But do you see an
opportunity for Huntington if perhaps as we have a little bit more clarity on the downside to the macro backdrop to
take advantage of that capital and reserve resilience, so to speak, and perhaps start thinking about being more
opportunistic in market share taking?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for the question. We do – we have focused on and we'll continue throughout the year to building
the capital, position the company, strengthening it. We're quite pleased with the results delivered in the first
quarter and look for comparable results as we go through the year where we're intending to be at or near the
high-end of our CET1 range. And we're doing that with a view that this threat of a recession is increasing. And
there's also a backdrop that there's going to be some kind of regulatory actions at some point in the foreseeable
future around capital requirements. So, with that in mind, that's the purpose of it.
Having said that, we intend to be opportunistic. We've got a lot of organic growth potential in the business lines.
We're very focused on our execution and as you saw last year with the acquisition of Capstone and Torana, we're
15

always looking to build up ancillary fee businesses within the company. Beyond that, in times of disruptions, there
tend to be people or teams that might be available and we'll again look to be opportunistic there.
And we see this in aggregate as a moment to take market share and that's where we're driving towards. We're
investing in the businesses. The outlook that Zach has shared with you, we'll have continued investment in
businesses, all of which is designed to enhance our – grow our earnings and enhance our returns.

question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I'm glad you clarified. I thought you might be going in a different direction.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Absolutely. And just as a follow-up to that, Zach, heard you loud and clear in terms of continuing to
optimize the right-hand side of your balance sheet. As you think about senior debt issuance, I suspect that
everything that you may be doing in the future would have a [ph] land (00:49:31) towards the potential for TLAC
eligibility?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
It's certainly on the thought process, Erika. Yes. We're watching that development carefully. Still pretty early days,
clearly, to see where that might land, but it's part of the thought process.

Just one follow-up on the capital front. Zach, you show on that slide 19 where the current potential impact of AFS
would be on CET1. I'm just wondering, do you have a rule of thumb if we kept all rates equal on just how fast that
would pull to par, either on a sequential basis or maybe by the end of 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yes. Yes. It's a great question, and considerable analysis around it. It's around 5% to 10% a year, depending on
what year it is [indiscernible] (00:50:30) totally flat curve basis. I'll give you a sense. We've just run this analysis
on the forward curve, as of March. It'll be 42% recapture by the end of 2024 in a forward curve scenario. I was just
[indiscernible] (00:50:47) in that one of interest rates declining relative to kind of flat scenario.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thank you. And just one question on the assets repricing side. You guys have some fixed rate assets that
are still repricing, even though I understand how you're slowing production. Just can you give us a sense on just
what your front book, back book benefits are in some of your fixed rate portfolios? And have we even really
started to see some of those benefits come through, given where rates have moved to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. It's a great question. We look at that very carefully, and we're seeing really nice step-up in loan yields.
[indiscernible] (00:51:24) new volume rates up almost 50 basis points – sorry, new volume up almost 70 basis
points, back book up almost 50 basis points in Q1. We estimate that our loan beta at this point through Q1 is
37%, and that could easily be over in the next couple of years approaching 60%. So you just sort of model the
yield curve.
So, we're a little further through the loan beta than we are with the deposit beta, but not much. And there's
certainly much more room to go in terms of loan yields from here, just given kind of about – just over 10% of the
portfolio is in auto, that the churn is pretty quick, just over two years. So kind of get the benefit of that repricing in
a somewhat delayed, but impactful beta there and then obviously the sort of the longer dated loan book likewise
is seeing a nice reset in terms of rates. And so, that'll benefit us over the coming quarters as well.

Good morning, Jon.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Few questions here, Zach. On slide 14, that green line on the bottom, the last time you said, it took a couple
of quarters for deposit cost to roll over after the Fed stopped. If were done in May, do you think that relationship
holds? Is it two quarters and deposit costs stopped going up, is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Generally, the expectation is up, Jon, yes, based on just the prior [indiscernible] (00:53:09) kind of function of the
pace with which rates might begin to decline and also what the kind of economic environment hence, the kind of
loan growth environment across the industry that would affect the competitive environment of deposit. So, that will
clearly play into it. But generally, our planning assumption is, as you noted, which is very much in keeping with
what we've seen not only in the last Fed cycle, but in multiple Fed cycles [ph] for that (00:53:37).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Fair enough. Steve or Rich, maybe for one of you, you used the term in the deck rigorous client selection

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
I really can't speak to what our peers are doing, but I can tell you that we, for years now, have developed a
process of really fine tuning who we do business with in the States. As you know, real estate cycles and you have
to be able to depend on who you're doing business with to support their projects. And so, we have really narrowed
the funnel around the types of sponsors that we work with. And we said, we hear them.
We look at their – just how long they've been in business. We looked at their financial wherewithal, we look at
their liquidity, and more importantly, we look at how they've behaved in past cycles, and we [ph] curate them, and
our curating (00:54:37) drives how much we'll [ph] have out (00:54:41) to any particular sponsor, how big of a
single project we will have for them and other metrics associated with that. So right now, we are focused on
serving the core and that will serve us well going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Look, Jon, we're always disciplined in our credit. I think that's going to prove to be the case as we come through
the cycle, obviously pleased with where we are at the moment. So, we'll see. But I can tell you, especially in CRE,
where we had enormous challenges in 2008-2009. We have sustained the disciplined here since that time, and
Rich has been a big part of it, along with our lending teams.

what surprised you the most over the past six weeks as you managed through some of the disruption?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
The speed of the run on the banks was a surprise, Jon, faster than anything we've seen that I can ever recall. And
I think, as a consequence of regulators and others, maybe a little behind what they – because they didn't expect it
either, and that's why I think it's a couple of weeks to get SVB resolved, and Signature as well.
Normally, there's more front end planning. They had a chance to light things up. This turned into a little bit more of
a scramble. Having said that, I thought the reaction on that Sunday night from Treasury [indiscernible] (00:56:23)

Hi Steven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I want to start, so on the net interest income outlook, which is taken down a bit, given everything Zach you
detailed on the swaps and the forward curve, as of right now, where do you see yourself trending within that? Is
there a bias either to the upside or downside within that range right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
When we set these ranges, we try to set them with our general expectations [indiscernible] (00:57:10) so that's
just kind of a baseline expectation. I think kind of what the puts and takes that would take you to the high and the
low end, including volume on one hand and just sort of the shape of the yield curve and the [indiscernible]
(00:57:23) on the other hand. So it's hard to generalize, but we feel quite good about landing in that range at this
point and that's what we're guiding for.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. And is the way we should think about it – so if we're at the low end of the NII range, should then, we should
be at the low end of the expense guidance, should we just connect those two?

Zachary J. Wasserman A

Generally speaking that is the way we think of them. We throttle the expense growth based on where the revenue
trajectory is going, and that's why we try to have a really disciplined forecasting process, because as we've said,
multiple economic scenarios and we try to do that. Obviously the expense lever takes some time to pull, and so
you need to have good line of sight to where that's going, and so it's possible [indiscernible] (00:58:08) rapid
move or surprising move but that's not possible [ph] unless you're (00:58:12) given a short time period. But over
the longer term, yes.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Thanks. So, maybe just one last one for Steve. Just following up on your response just now to Jon's
question. Given the speed at which deposits went out, Silicon Valley Bank, when you look at that, do you view
that from a distance as a unique one-off event, or are there lessons that you're now applying the way you think
about managing capital, risk, liquidity that even a stable regional bank like yourself will change potentially fairly
materially in the aftermath of what we just saw? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Steve, I think there are always lessons learned, but the business models of SVB and Signature were so different
from us and other regional banks, but particularly from us, the concentrations of the uninsured deposit were about
95%. Just in retrospect, it seems rather clear that the liquidity risk was very, very different and a huge mess,
combined with the asset liability. In terms of lessons for us, it's [indiscernible] (00:59:25) that much more aware of
liquidity. We've always seen this as a prime risk, we've always set good backup and we've been very granular, an
advantage to have that best-in-class uninsured to total deposit ratio. But we'll probably be more even more
cautious, that probably we'll be even more cautious given the speed at which things move as we go forward.
Having said all that, we're in a very strong position today. We expect to grow deposits as we continue through the
year. And so it's like extra vigilance. We may do some policy adjustments to reinforce and strengthen further, but
that will be of minor nature, I don't think it will impact our performance.
