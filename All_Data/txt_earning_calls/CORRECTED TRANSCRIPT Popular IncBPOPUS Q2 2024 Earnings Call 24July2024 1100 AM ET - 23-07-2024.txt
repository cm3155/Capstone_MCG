Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2024
Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Good morning and thank you for joining the call. Before I discuss the highlights for the second quarter, I am
pleased to report that today we announced a 13% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.62 to
$0.70 per share, commencing with the dividend payable in the first quarter of 2025 and a $500 million common
stock repurchase authorization. These actions evidenced the strength of our capital position, which allows us to
continue to invest in our franchise and serve the needs of our customers, while also returning capital to our
shareholders.
Please turn to slide 3. We are pleased to report a strong second quarter, achieving net income of $178 million.
Excluding the impact of the FDIC Special Assessment and tax withholding matter on the results for the first
quarter, net income increased by $43 million. The results in the second quarter were driven by higher net interest
income and lower provision for credit losses.
Our ending loan balances increased by $473 million during the quarter. BPPR achieved loan growth of $509
million, reflecting growth across almost all lending segments. Popular Bank saw a $36 million decrease in loan
balances, driven by $140 million commercial loan payoffs that offset growth in construction loans. Deposit
balances increased by approximately $1.7 billion, driven by higher level of Puerto Rico government deposits.
Our net interest margin increased by 6 basis points to 3.22%, mainly driven by higher average loan balances and
the repricing of loans and reinvestment of securities in a higher interest rate environment. This was partially offset
by higher deposit costs. Non-interest income increased by $2 million to $166 million. Excluding the additional
FDIC Special Assessment and the expenses associated with the prior-period tax expense, operating expenses
increased by $7 million, driven by professional fees and transaction-related costs.
Credit quality trends improved in the quarter with lower net charge-offs, NPLs and NPL inflows. The credit trends
in the Puerto Rico unsecured consumer segments have stabilized. Tangible book value per share of $62.71
increased by $2.65, driven by our quarterly net income and lower unrealized losses in our investment portfolio.
Please turn to slide 4. Consumer spending remained healthy. Combined credit and debit card sales increased by
5%, compared to the second quarter of 2023. Our auto loan and lease balances increased by $129 million,
compared to the first quarter, as demand for new cars continued to be strong in Puerto Rico.
Mortgage loan balances at BPPR increased by $107 million in the second quarter, driven primarily by home
purchase activity and our existing strategy to retain FHA loans in portfolio. Business activity in Puerto Rico
remains solid, as reflected in the positive trends in total employment, consumer spending, and other economic
data. The tourism and hospitality sector continues to be a source of strength for the local economy.
Passenger traffic at the San Juan International Airport increased by 8% in the second quarter, compared to the
second quarter of 2023. Hotel occupancy was flat year-over-year in the first half of 2024, and the average daily
rate and RevPAR were up slightly year-to-date compared to the same period a year ago. There is a significant
amount of committed federal funds that have yet to be disbursed. The pace of disbursement of these funds has
accelerated, and we anticipate that they will support economic activity for several years. We remain optimistic
about the future of our primary market and are well-positioned to support our clients during the coming years. In
short, we are pleased with our financial performance for the quarter, particularly in Puerto Rico, where continued
loan growth and improvement – improved credit metrics helped contribute to our increase in net interest income
and support our optimistic outlook for the balance of the year.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2024
On that note, I now turn the call over to Jorge for more details on our financial results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio. Good morning. And thank you all for joining the call today. As Ignacio stated, we reported net
income of $178 million in the second quarter, $43 million higher than the prior- year period's adjusted results. We
are pleased with the core results, particularly the NII growth and the expansion of the NIM. Net interest income
increased by $18 million. Our net interest margin increased by 6 basis points on a GAAP basis and 10 basis
points on a tax equivalent basis, driven by the repricing of loans and securities and higher balances.
Loan growth improved this quarter to 1.5% year-to-date, driven by BPPR, where we saw loan growth across
nearly all categories, led by commercial lending, auto and mortgage originations. The underlying economic
activity in Puerto Rico remains strong. However, the demand for credit in our US market continues to be less than
we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. As a result, we now expect consolidated loan growth to be
towards the low end of our original 3% to 6% guidance.
Consolidated customer deposit balances, excluding Puerto Rico public deposits, were flat, as increases in time
deposits at Popular Bank were offset by outflows at BPPR. However, average customer balances during the
quarter were higher, including noninterest-bearing demand deposits.
At the end of the second quarter, Puerto Rico public deposits were $19.7 billion, up $1.7 billion compared to Q1
and above the upper end of our year-end guidance range. Q2 is typically the peak in public deposit balances and
is mostly related to tax receipts. Normal annual seasonality should result in these balances trending lower for the
rest of the year. By the end of 2024, we expect public deposits to be near the upper end of our $15 billion to $18
billion guidance.
While higher balances of public deposits contribute to higher NII, approximately $800 million of low-cost
government-related accounts managed by our Fiduciary Services group were repriced during the quarter to
market-linked rates, offsetting, in part, the benefit of the higher balances. As a result of the shift of the deposit mix
toward higher cost deposits, along with a slower loan growth in the US, we now expect our year-over-year growth
in NII to be 8% to 10%.
Non-interest income was $166 million, an increase of $2 million from Q1, driven primarily by higher credit card
and debit card fees from customer transaction activity. We continue to expect non-interest income to be
approximately $160 million to $165 million per quarter. During the second quarter, we were also very pleased to
see the continued improvement in credit metrics. The provision for credit losses of $47 million was $26 million
lower than the first quarter.
Total operating expenses were $470 million or $7 million higher than last quarter's adjusted operating expense.
The increase was driven by professional fees due to advisory-related expenses and increase to reserves for
operational losses and higher transactional expenses tied to client activity. These increases were offset, in part,
by lower personnel expenses, which are traditionally higher during the first quarter of the year, due to annual
incentive awards and payroll taxes.
We continue to expect total 2024 expenses in the range of $1.89 billion to $1.95 billion. Our effective tax rate for
the quarter was 19%, compared to a 25% adjusted tax rate in the prior quarter, as we benefited from higher tax-
exempt income and certain tax credit during the quarter. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for the year
to be in the range of 21% to 23%.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2024
Please turn to slide 6. Net interest margin increased by 6 basis points. On a taxable equivalent basis, NIM was
3.48%, an increase of 10 basis points. The increase was driven by higher earning asset yields and balances. This
benefit was partially offset by higher interest expense on deposits due to increased average balances of public
deposits at BPPR and time deposits at Popular Bank.
During the quarter, we continued to see the benefits in the contribution of the investment portfolio as low-yielding
maturities are reinvested in short-term T-bills that are tax-exempt in Puerto Rico. This improved the tax effective
yield of the securities portfolio by 24 basis points to 3.47%.
In BPPR, the cost of total deposits increased by 2 basis points to 1.83%. The total deposit costs at BPPR
continue to be impacted by the proportion of public deposits to total deposits. At Popular Bank, deposit costs
increased by 3 basis points during the quarter. This change reflected a significant stabilization when compared to
an increase of 23 basis points in Q1. We expect a continued NIM expansion throughout the rest of 2024.
Please turn to slide 7. Regulatory capital levels remained strong. Our CET ratio of 16.5% increased by 12 basis
points from Q1. Tangible value per share at the end of the quarter was $62.71, an increase of $2.65 per share
from Q1. Return on tangible common equity improved by nearly 500 basis points in the quarter to 11.8%. We
continue to target a sustainable 14% return on tangible common equity by the end of 2025.
As Ignacio mentioned, we announced an increase in our quarterly common dividend of $0.08 per share to $0.70.
We expect our board to approve and declare this dividend in Q4 for payment in the first quarter of 2025, and a
$500 million common stock repurchase authorization. We expect to execute the stock repurchases in the open
market. The timing and quantity of the repurchases will be subject to various factors, including market conditions,
our capital position and financial performance. We will provide quarterly updates on our activity as part of our
earnings webcast and SEC filings.
With that, I turn over the call to Lidio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Jorge, and good morning. Credit quality metrics improved from the first quarter, with the corporation's
mortgage and commercial portfolios continue to reflect credit metrics significantly below pre-pandemic levels,
while credit quality metrics continue to normalize for Puerto Rico's consumer portfolios. We continue to closely
monitor changes in the macroeconomic environment and on borrower performance. Given higher interest rates
and inflationary pressures, we remain encouraged by the performance of our loan book.
Turning to slide number 8. Non-performing assets and non-performing loans decreased during the quarter, driven
by the BPPR segment. NPLs and BPPR decreased by $12 million, reflecting improvements across most loan
categories. NPLs in the Popular Bank segment remained flat, driven by the return to accrual of a $17 million
mortgage loan, offset by a $17 million commercial NPL inflow. OREO has decreased in BPPR by $10 million,
driven by the sale of a commercial real estate property.
Inflows of NPLs decreased by 2 million. In BPPR, total inflows increased by $8 million, driven by higher mortgage
inflows, while in Popular Bank, inflows decreased by $9 million, as last quarter activity include a single $17 million
mortgage loan that entered NPL, offset in part by higher commercial inflows by $7 million. The ratio of NPLs to
total loans held-in-portfolio remained flat at 1%.

Turning to slide number 9, net charge-off amounted to $54 million or annualized 61 basis points of average loans
held-in-portfolio, compared to $62 million or 71 basis points in the prior-year quarter. Net-charge off in BPPR
decreased by $7 million, driven by lower consumer by $5 million and lower commercial by $2 million. The
decrease in consumer net charge-off were driven by lower auto by $4 million and lower personal loans by $1
million. In Popular Bank, net charge-off decreased by $1 million due to lower consumer net charge-offs.
Given the credit performance in the first half of the year and our outlook for the second half, we now expect net
charge-offs to be near the low end of our initial full year guidance of 65 basis points to 85 basis points.
Please turn to slide number 10. The allowance for loan losses decreased by $9 million to $730 million. And BPPR
ratio remained flat. I think this is driven by higher commercial loan volumes, higher qualitative reserves and
changes in credit quality were offset by changes in the macroeconomic scenarios and net charge-offs.
In Popular Bank, the ACL decreased by $9 million, mainly driven by lower reserves for the commercial portfolio
due to risk rating improvements. The corporation ratio of ACL to loans held-in-portfolio decreased slightly from
2.11% to 2.05%, while the ratio of ACL to NPLs improved slightly from 209% in the previous quarter to 214% this
quarter. The provision for loan losses was $44 million, compared to $72 million in the prior quarter, reflecting
lower losses, changes to credit quality and improvement in macroeconomic scenarios.
In BPPR, the provision was $49 million compared to $61 million, while in Popular Bank, the provision was a
benefit of $4 billion compared to an expense of $11 million in the first quarter.
To summarize, credit quality metrics improved during the second quarter and we remain encouraged by the
performance of our loan book.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Lidio and Jorge, for your updates. Our results for the first half of 2024 were strong, driven by higher
net interest income and expanding in interest margin and improved credit quality. We are continuing to execute on
our transformation to better serve our customers and drive returns over time. We are investing in talent and
technology to deepen our relationships with clients and maximize the opportunities inherent in our unique
franchise. I am optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of the year. Business trends in Puerto Rico
continue to be positive, and we are well-positioned to participate in the economic activity that is expected to be
generated in the coming years.
We are mindful of the responsibility we have to Puerto Rico as the leading banking institution and to all the
communities that we proudly served. In June, we released our Annual Corporate Sustainability Report. We
continue to focus on providing opportunity for progress, protecting the environment and promoting trust. One of
the highlights of the report included the financing of one of the largest transactions to-date in the renewable
energy sector in Puerto Rico, a solar farm that produces enough electricity to supply the needs of approximately
7,000 homes in Puerto Rico.
Finally, providing an opportunity in our community starts with ensuring Popular remains a great place to work. I
want to thank all our colleagues for their continued dedication and commitment to serve our customers and
contribute to our success.

Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I would like to start out with the capital plan. It certainly came at least a quarter sooner than I had expected. Just
wondering, I know you guys were waiting for some clarity on the outlook before coming out with something. Has
anything changed in terms of your comfort level with where you're viewing the capital position and the outlook
ahead that allowed you to come out with this in July? And also wondering any guideposts we should be thinking
about in terms of what your constraining capital ratio is and how you're thinking about stepping in with the
buyback, especially with the run we've had in the stock? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. Obviously, we hear our investors, and our board and managers are very conscious that people wanted a
statement from us on where we were on a capital return. We worked very hard with our group. We went through
some analysis of our credit book and what we thought about the future. And we thought that the $500 million
authorization was the appropriate amount given the circumstances. We also thought, given our view, that the
dividend increase was important, I think that's an important piece of the puzzle. So obviously, that shows our
confidence in the future.
In terms of where we're going, we're going to do open market purchases, we still think that the stock is fairly
valued. So, we – I really have more insight to that, but we still believe that the stock is fairly valued, especially
relative to our peers and others in the industry.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2024
Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. And then, with the NII outlook being reduced, just a point of clarification, the 8%
to 10% growth that you're currently projecting for this year, is that on a GAAP basis or an FTE, because there are
some moving parts with the FTE adjustment this year that does make it somewhat meaningful?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you for the question, Kelly. Yeah. All of our guidance is GAAP basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. And with your outlook for government deposits to decline off of that $19.7 billion level where
we're at now, as we look ahead, should we be thinking about the balance sheet as being relatively flat from here,
given the movement in government front – funds between now and year-end?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
I mean, certainly, if – I would expect the movement – if you see a decrease in deposits, we would not be
leveraging of the balance sheet with alternative sources of liquidity. So, I think that's a fair statement in terms of
more or less around that level of decrease of public funds.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Thank you. I'll step back.

Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Timur. First, the repricing is baked into our guidelines. So our updated guidance takes into account
this repricing. It happened towards the end of the quarter and I think at the beginning of June. So, I mean, I don't
know if there's any other part of the question there, Timur. Can you – I think [indiscernible] (00:22:22).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q

No, that's helpful. And then, just what drove that businesses [ph] or that action (00:22:32)?

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, maybe just following up on Kelly's FTE question, can you just give us an update on where you
expect FTE for the year in context of the updated guide? How much of that revision was driven by [indiscernible]
(00:23:03)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. Timur, we don't usually give guidance on FTE basis. Our guidance is all GAAP basis. The tax rate, we do
provide you the tax rate. So it allows you to at least get a sense of the flow to EPS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. But should we expect further reinvestment into tax-advantaged T-bills, or has that remixing largely played
out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
No. If you probably remember, we have about $1 billion a quarter in maturities in our investment portfolio. We
currently continue to invest in T-bills or fund loan growth. So ultimately, we haven't exhausted our potential for tax
expense and security.

Okay. Got it. And then, just last for me, just around the cadence for buybacks, is the expectation that we go back

expense growth?

Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
So, let's talk about the expenses first. You know that various seasonality in expenses, for example, merit
increases, our personnel costs are a significant portion of our expenses, our merit increased schedule is in the
summer. So, that is an expense that will be accretive or an incremental expense that we'll see in the second half
of the year. We continue to have efforts around the transformation, professional fees, technology as these are not
symmetric throughout the year.
So, in terms of fee income, there is – there are a lot of components to that fee income. Some of it comes from our
equity – pick-up investment in bank that we have today in the Dominican Republic. There's transactional activity
from clients. I mean, there are a lot of variances, and frankly, $2 million or $3 million, up or down any quarter, it's
not an unusual variance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. All right. Thanks. And then, when we look at credit, good trends in credit and charge-offs, do you think that
we've seen peak consumer charge-offs here? And where should we expect to see the ACL settle out? Is this a
good rate as a ratio of loans, or is there still room for that to move lower?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
Right. A lot of that, [ph] where you asked (00:27:04), it's going to be economy dependent we feel and we're
comfortable with the state of the economy and the economy or the outlook for the economy going forward. And
so, I'll leave it at that. I mean, the rate and the charge-off on the top of the ACL will depend on the economy.

Okay. [indiscernible] (00:27:27), though, you still feel pretty confident on the general trajectory at this point, it
sounds like.

Thomas Leddy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Thomas Leddy calling on behalf of Gerard. Loan growth has remained pretty solid now
for several consecutive quarters, while some of your peers have seen negative growth in recent periods.
Acknowledging you guys have guided to the lower end of your overall loan growth range, as you look ahead,

given the remaining sort of idiosyncratic tailwinds for the island specifically, could loan growth for BPPR actually
accelerate from here as some of the construction projects you guys have referenced historically sort of come
online?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
So, this is Ignacio, I think we would reiterate the guidance we've given. I think we feel pretty good about the
economic activity in Puerto Rico. We are seeing a lot of positive economic activity, investment from outside the
island, entrepreneurs locally. So we feel pretty good. And if you saw the results, we are seeing loan growth in
Puerto Rico. What's holding us back a little bit is that the US, like many of our peers in the US, that especially they
focus a lot on commercial real estate, that loan growth has been slower and slower than we expected. So, again,
in general, we reiterate the guidance. We feel good about Puerto Rico. But we feel that the US has been a bit
slower than we actually had expected.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Leddy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, just more broadly, can you give us some color regarding your appetite for
actually growing that mainland portfolio in the face of what's expected to remain a pretty uncertain credit
environment in the back end of this year and into early next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I would say, generally, I don't really [ph] going to answer that (00:29:27). We're comfortable with the portfolio that
we have, but obviously, we've been – as most banks, we have been prudently looking at the market, and we are
being careful, especially in the commercial real estate sector. But we're very comfortable with the portfolio we
had.
So, again, there is a lot of pressure, in general, from regulators and others to sort of make sure your growth in that
area is cautious. So we'll be cautious like the rest of the market, commercial real estate. But we have other areas
that we're hopeful, the condominium association that I think is an area we're expecting to see some more growth
from. But, yeah, we'll be cautious with the commercial real estate, just like everyone else.

Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. I just wanted to turn back to those lower cost of government deposits for question. After the $1
million that's already been repriced, how much more do you have in lower cost balances? And can you give any
sense for the sort of difference between the reset yield and the original one?

Yeah. I'm not going to give specific information on the reset. I will tell you that you can see in the levels and yield,
these deposits are categorized as time deposits so you can get a sense of the increase in the cost in that
segment of our levels and yield schedule. In terms of other large low-cost, I'm not aware of any significant
amounts that would reprice or are subject to repricing.

Operator: We have a follow-up question from Kelly Motta with KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Thank you so much for letting me back in. I have two questions, if I could sneak in. The first is on – just a
clarification on the tax rate. The tax-advantaged income brought down the tax rate considerably this quarter from
last. And I think you also had some discrete items impacting last quarter. I know you guide on a full-year basis,
but would it be fair to say, within that range, 2Q is a good starting point to – for forecasting the back half of this
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
I think, as you mentioned, the quarter did have some discrete events that may not recur. So that is something that
I wouldn't certainly not multiply it times 3, I guess. So I...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
I mean, we've given the guidance. I think you can work on to – I mean, it's GAAP guidance, so you know what the
first quarter was, second quarter, and I think, you can get a sense of what the rates [indiscernible] (00:32:43).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I got it.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Fair enough. And then I was hoping if you could spend a minute talking about your insurance subsidiary, we've
seen a couple of banks sell those at a considerable gain, as well as your stake in the Dominican bank. Just

wondering if – you know how management is viewing these businesses and if there's any potential gains that
could be harvested from that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yes. Let me start by saying we don't have any current plans to sell either of those investments. Obviously, like
any business, we always – we look at every opportunity, but it is not in our current plans.
In terms of the BHD, that's been a very successful investment for us. It produces a steady amount of income
every quarter, as mentioned, or it was mentioned, the equity pick up has been very good. They also produce a
cash dividend, which brings money to the holding company. It's a well-run bank in a growing economy. So, we'd
have to have a much better use for our money. The tax implication of selling that would not be great to the
Dominican Republic. So, it wouldn't be – right now, we've looked at it, but really, I think we're going to hold that
investment.
And in insurance, it's very important for us. It's one of the things, and one of our thesis is how we can become
more embedded in the lives of our clients. And I think insurance is an area in Puerto Rico where many of our
citizens are underinsured. And we think we can add value to them by bringing a comprehensive suite of services.
So that's not something that, in my mind right now we would sell. I think it's an important part of our fee business
and we like it.

Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
