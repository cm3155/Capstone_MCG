Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Citi's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Review with the Chief Executive Officer,
Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today's call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi
Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you
have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Lynn, you may begin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Elizabeth Lynn
Managing Director-Investor Relations, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat,
will speak first. Then Mark Mason, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for
download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements,
which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in
circumstances.
Actual results, capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of
factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC
filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2019 Form 10-K.
With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.

Michael Louis Corbat
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported earnings for the second quarter of 2020, with
net income of $1.3 billion, we had earnings per share of $0.50. As in the first quarter, credit costs weighed down
our net income. However, the overall business performance was strong, which shows that we've been able to
navigate the COVID-19 pandemic reasonably well [indiscernible] (00:01:54). With solid revenue growth of 5% and
strong expense management down 1%, both on a year-on-year basis, our margin was up 13%.
We grew loans, and our deposits were up significantly. Our regulatory capital increased, and we continued to add
to our substantial levels of liquidity, and our balance sheet has more than ample capacity to continue to serve our
clients. The Institutional Clients Group had an exceptional quarter. Fixed Income was up 68%. We had our best
Investment Banking quarter in recent history, and private bank revenues approached $1 billion. And while
Treasury and Trade Solutions continued to be impacted by the lower rate environment, we did see good client
engagement and strong deposit growth in that business. Global Consumer Banking revenues were down and
spending slowed significantly due to the pandemic.
In North America, despite the decline in purchase sale activity, Branded Card (sic) [Branded Cards] (00:02:58)
revenue was up slightly due to a mix shift towards interest-earning balances. At the same time, Retail Services
saw a significant decline in consumer spending with our partners. Retail Banking saw higher mortgage revenue
from refinancing activity due to the low rate environment. In Asia, the slowdown in travel and consumer activity
again reduced revenues. And in Mexico, revenues declined as the country is struggling from the effects of the
health pandemic.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
Our capital position strengthened during the quarter, with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increasing to 11.5% on
an advanced basis. I was pleased with our results from the Federal Reserve's latest stress test, placing our stress
capital buffer at 2.5%. This leads us comfortably above our new regulatory minimum of 10%. Our tangible book
value per share of $71.15 was down only slightly from the first quarter, but still up 5% from a year ago. We plan to
keep paying our quarterly dividend, as long as macroeconomic and financial conditions permit.
During the quarter, we continued to support our clients, colleagues and communities through this pandemic.
While I'd like to see more of our people back in the office, we've been clear that we won't do anything to
jeopardize their health and safety. Most recently, we paused plans to invite a limited number of colleagues back to
sites located in areas where the health data was going in the wrong direction.
We've also remained committed to supporting communities through a variety of initiatives. These now total over
$100 million in contributions from our company and its foundation. But what I'm most proud of is the $2 million,
which my colleagues donated out of their own pockets to organizations providing COVID relief as part of our
matching program. And we recently made our first distribution to the Citi Foundation, representing $25 million in
net profits from the Payroll Protection Program to support community development financial institutions.
We're also partnering with minority-owned depository institutions to help them extend credit to businesses through
PPP by purchasing their loans through a $50 million facility. This effort is even more important as we look at the
economic disparities drawn along racial lines in our society. And of course, we continue to serve our clients,
whether it's providing consumer relief or helping companies access the capital markets to strengthen their
balance sheets.
We entered the second half in a strong position to handle what comes our way. We are in a completely
unpredictable environment [indiscernible] (00:05:57) models no cycles to point to. The pandemic has a grip on the
economy, and it doesn't seem likely to loosen until vaccines are widely available. We'll keep managing through
this with a sharp emphasis on our risk management. We continue to make investments in our infrastructure to
enhance our safety, soundness and controls to ensure that we have an indisputably strong and stable institution.
With that, Mark will go through our presentation, and then we'll be happy to answer your questions.

Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 4. Citigroup reported second quarter net income
of $1.3 billion, which included a $5.6 billion increase in credit reserves this quarter, primarily reflecting the
deterioration in the economic outlook since the end of the first quarter under CECL, and downgrade in the
corporate loan portfolio. The reserve build also includes an additional qualitative management adjustment to
reflect the potential for a higher level of stress and/or a somewhat slower recovery.
Revenues of $19.8 billion grew by 5% from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher Fixed Income and Investment
Banking revenues. Expenses were down slightly year-over-year, resulting in positive operating leverage, and a
13% improvement in operating margin.
Credit costs were $7.9 billion this quarter. Our effective tax rate was 9% for the second quarter, reflecting a higher
relative impact from tax advantage investments and other tax benefit items given the lower level of EBIT.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
Looking at results for the first half of 2020, we delivered net income of $3.8 billion even as we increased credit
reserves by $10.5 billion under the CECL framework given the current environment. We grew revenues by 8%,
predominantly reflecting continued strength in our Markets and Investment Banking businesses, while we held
expenses flat year-over-year, allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage, and a 20% increase in operating
margin.
In constant dollars, end-of-period loans grew 1% year-over-year to $685 billion, reflecting growth in our
institutional businesses, mostly offset by the impact of lower spending activity in our consumer business. Deposits
grew 20%, reflecting engagement with clients and a flight to quality, so to speak, across both the institutional and
consumer franchises, which serve to strengthen our available liquidity. And we maintained a strong capital and
liquidity position, which has been critical to our ability to support our clients as they manage through this crisis.
As of June 30, our CET1 capital ratio was 11.5%, 150 basis points above our regulatory minimum requirement.
We had close to $900 billion in available liquidity. And including the additional reserves taken this quarter, credit
reserves stand at roughly $28 billion with the reserve ratio of 3.89% of funded loans. With the level of capital,
liquidity and the reserves we hold today, plus significant pre-provision earnings power seen through the first half
of the year, we continue to operate from a position of strength. And as we discussed last quarter, we are
combining this financial strength with operational resiliency, which allows us to partner with and support our
clients as we all manage through this crisis.
Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars.
Revenues declined 7% as strong deposit growth was more than offset by lower loan volumes and lower interest
rates across all regions. And expenses decreased 8% as lower volume-related expenses, reduction in marketing
and other discretionary spending and efficiency savings were partially offset by increases in COVID-19-related
expenses. Total credit cost of $3.9 billion were up significantly from last year including a reserve build of
approximately $2 billion, driven by the deterioration in the economic outlook.
Slide 6 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. Second quarter revenues of $4.7 billion
were down 5% from last year. During the quarter, we continued to focus on providing assistance to help
customers impacted by COVID-19. Since the crisis began, we have provided relief to more than 2 million
accounts, representing roughly 6% of our aggregate balances across cards and mortgages.
In a hopeful sign, many of those same customers have continued to make their regular payments during the
second quarter, although we realized [audio gap] (00:11:01) and to-date, over half of our card enrollees have
rolled off the program with more than 80% of these customers remaining current, while reenrollment rates remain
below expectations in about the mid-teens.
Turning now to the businesses, starting with cards. Branded Cards revenues of $2.2 billion were up 1% year-
over-year as lower purchase sales and lower average loans were offset by a favorable mix shift towards interest-
earning balances, which supported net interest revenues. As seen across the industry, purchase sales declined
significantly, down 21% in the second quarter. However, in recent weeks, we have seen signs of improvement
with purchase sales down in the low-double digits year-over-year in June, compared to a 30% decline in April.
Average loans declined 7%, reflecting lower sales activity.
We also took credit actions during the quarter, including a pause in proactive marketing, and a reduction in credit
line increases in Balcon activity as examples. We believe these risk actions are prudent given the current
environment, but they are likely to result in more pressure on interest-earning balances in the second half of the
year.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
Retail Services revenues of $1.4 billion were down 13% year-over-year, reflecting lower average loans as well as
higher partner payments. Net interest revenues were down 7% as average loans declined by 6% on lower
purchase sale activity. Purchase sales were down 25% year-over-year in the second quarter, but similar to
Branded Cards, we saw improvement in the month of June, with the pace of sales decline slowing to the mid-
teens.
Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year. As we have discussed in
the past, Retail Services revenues are shown net of payments related to income-sharing arrangements with our
retail partners, which can vary quarter to quarter based on the overall mix and profit outlook for our portfolios.
Retail Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 3% year-over-year as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes
and an improvement in mortgage revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spreads. Our deposit
momentum continued to improve, with average deposits up 14% driven by a combination of environmental
factors, including the delay of tax payments, stimulus payments and a reduction in overall spending as well as our
continued strategic efforts to drive organic growth.
Digital deposit sales accelerated even as we continued to adjust pricing given the current rate environment, with
digital deposits growing by $3 billion this quarter to a total of nearly $12 billion. We also saw a strong engagement
with existing clients, driving balanced growth across deposit products, including check-ins, which grew 13% year-
over-year.
Total expenses for North America consumer were down 10% year-over-year as reductions in marketing and other
discretionary expenses, along with efficiency savings and lower volume-related costs, more than offset
incremental COVID-19-related expenses.
Turning to credit. Total credit cost of $3 billion increased significantly from last year as we built roughly $1.5 billion
in reserve this quarter, reflecting the impact of changes in our economic outlook, partially offset by the impact of a
change in accounting for third-party collection fees.
On slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined
15% year-over-year in the second quarter. Cards revenues declined by 22%, reflecting lower activity levels with
purchase sales down 29% year-over-year.
We're seeing a disproportionate impact on Asia card revenues from lower travel spend in the region, given our
affluent client base and a greater proportion of fee revenues coming from travel-related interchange and foreign
transaction fees. We also saw an impact on customer acquisition in products like insurance, which rely more
heavily on face-to-face engagement.
However, average deposit growth remained strong at 10% this quarter, albeit at lower deposit spreads, reflecting
a flight-to-quality, as well as continued client engagement across the franchise. While investment revenues were
down this quarter, we saw continued underlying growth in our wealth management drivers, with 6% growth in
Citigold clients and 10% growth in net new money versus last year.
Today, we're seeing some early signs of a pickup in activity, with purchase sales declines moderating, and net
new money and investment sales showing material improvement in June versus prior months, but the shape of
the recovery remains fluid.

Turning to Latin America. Total consumer revenues declined 7% year-over-year year. Similar to other regions, we
saw good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter, with average balances up 9%. However, revenues were
impacted by lower purchase sales and loan volumes, as well as lower deposit spreads in the current environment.
In total, operating expenses for our international business were down 4% in the second quarter, reflecting
efficiency savings and lower volume-related expenses, and cost of credit increased to $883 million.
Slide 8 provides additional detail on Global Consumer credit trends. Credit loss rates generally trended upward
this quarter as a result of the macroeconomic slowdown, although this was much more a function of the lower
loan balances, as it is still too early to see a pronounced impact from COVID-19 on our net credit losses.
90-plus day delinquency rates improved in the US despite the lower balances, as reduced spending, combined
with the benefit of significant government stimulus and our own customer relief efforts, has generated liquidity,
which has been used to pay down debt even into the later delinquency buckets.
Earlier-stage delinquencies are also improving, given the additional liquidity and the impact of relief efforts,
although it is still early and there is still significant uncertainty around the timing of the economic recovery and
how customers will perform once these relief and stimulus programs start to roll off.
Delinquency rates were up slightly in Asia, although still at modest absolute levels. And in Mexico, we saw a more
significant impact as COVID-19 is still peaking in that market and customers are not benefiting from the same
level of government stimulus.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide 9. Revenues of $12.1 billion increased 21% in second
quarter and were up 25% excluding a roughly $350 million pre-tax gain around investment in Tradeweb in the
prior year, as strong performance in Fixed Income, Investment Banking, and the Private Bank was partially offset
by lower revenues in TTS, Corporate Lending, and Securities Services. The quarter was also impacted by $431
million of mark-to-market losses on loan hedges, as credit spreads tightened during the quarter.
During the quarter, we continued to see strong client engagement across all of our institutional businesses, and
we have been actively helping our clients navigate through this uncertain environment. In TTS, we continue to
work with our clients to sustain their operations, manage their supply chains, and optimize their working capital
and liquidity. We're continuing to see momentum in our digital efforts, as evidenced by strong growth in CitiDirect
users and digital account openings, which further deepen our relationships with our clients.
In Markets, we saw record volumes as we supported our clients, leveraging our Citi Velocity platform and
electronic execution capability. And similar to the first quarter, we actively made markets for both our corporate
and investor clients as we helped them navigate through volatile macroeconomic conditions.
In Investment Banking, clients remain focused on both sources and uses of short-term and long-term liquidity. We
continue to provide new loans and facilitate additional draws for clients looking to bolster liquidity. However, we
also saw significant repayments, which led to the sequential decline in end-of-period loans in corporate lending.
And we'll continue to help our clients access capital markets, which drove further share gains. I would note that
investment-grade debt underwriting was up 131% year-over-year as we continue to help our clients source
liquidity in this evolving environment.
Turning now to the results for the businesses, starting with Banking. Total Banking revenues of $5.7 billion
increased 4%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were down 11% as reported and 7% in

constant dollars, as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of
lower interest rates and lower commercial cards revenues.
Our average deposits were up 30% in constant dollars. We had strong growth in our instant payments and API
volume, and our cross-border flows were resilient despite the significant macro slowdown, all of which give us
confidence in the underlying health of the franchise.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.8 billion were up 37% from last year, outperforming the market wallet and
delivering the highest revenue quarter since the financial crisis. Results reflected strong growth in both debt and
equity underwriting, partially offset by M&A. Private Bank revenues of $956 million grew 10%, driven by increased
capital markets activity, as well as higher lending and deposit volumes, partially offset by lower deposit spreads.
Corporate Lending revenues of $646 million were down 11%, as higher volumes were more than offset by lower
spreads. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $6.9 billion increased 48% year-over-year. Fixed
Income revenues of $5.6 billion grew 68%, reflecting strong performance across rates and currencies, spread
products, and commodities.
Equities revenues of $770 million were down 3% versus last year, as solid performance in cash equities was
more than offset by lower revenues in derivatives and prime finance, reflecting a more challenging environment.
And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were down 9% on a reported basis and 5% in constant dollars, as
higher deposit volumes were more than offset by lower spreads.
Total operating expenses of $5.9 billion increased 7% year-over-year, as efficiency savings were more than offset
by higher compensation costs, continued investment, and volume-driven growth. Total credit costs of $3.9 billion
were up significantly from last year.
We built roughly $3.5 billion in reserves this quarter. The increase in reserves reflected the impact of changes in
the economic outlook, as well as downgrades in the corporate loan portfolio during the quarter. As of quarter end,
our overall funded reserve ratio was 1.71%, including 4.9% on the noninvestment-grade portion. We provide more
detail on the corporate portfolio in the Appendix of our earnings presentation.
Total non-accrual loans increased $1.5 billion sequentially this quarter, reflecting the current environment, with
roughly half of the increase coming from smaller-sized exposure. Overall, we remain vigilant in managing the
portfolio and reserve levels relative to the stresses we see out there today.
Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of $290 million declined significantly from last year,
reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets and the impact of lower rates, partially offset by AFS gain, as well as
positive marks on legacy securities, as spreads tightened during the quarter.
Expenses were down slightly as the wind-down of legacy assets was partially offset by higher infrastructure costs,
as well as incremental costs associated with COVID-19, and a pre-tax loss of $343 million this quarter, reflecting
loan loss reserves on our legacy portfolio, as well as lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses.
Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trend. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.1
billion this quarter declined $580 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan
balances, partially offset by higher trading-related NIR and the improved mix in Branded Cards that I mentioned
earlier.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
On a sequential basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $250 million, mainly reflecting the lower rate
environment, partially offset by higher trading-related NIR and the absence of an episodic onetime item. And net
interest margin declined 31 basis points sequentially, with lower net interest revenues driving roughly one-third of
the decline and the remainder representing balance sheet growth, reflecting an increase in liquid assets, driven by
higher deposits as we accommodated the needs of our clients, while also strengthening our own liquidity in the
current environment.
Turning to noninterest revenue. In the second quarter, a strong performance in trading and Investment Banking
drove a significant increase year-over-year. As we look to the third quarter, we expect both, net interest revenues
and noninterest revenues, to decline year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower levels of
activity related to COVID-19, as well as a normalization in Investment Banking activity.
On slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio improved to 11.5%, primarily reflecting the
decline in risk-weighted assets. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 6.7%, primarily reflecting the
benefit of the temporary relief granted by the FRB. And our tangible book value per share declined slightly to
$71.15, reflecting the debt valuation adjustment, DVA, impact to OCI, as Citi's credit spreads tightened during the
quarter.
During the quarter, we also received our stress test results, including our preliminary stress capital buffer, SCB,
requirement of 2.5%. Incorporating this SCB and a GSIB surcharge of 3% results in a minimum regulatory
requirement of 10%.
In summary, the environment remained challenging this quarter, but we continued to perform well. We ended the
period with a strong capital and liquidity position. The underlying business performance this quarter remained
solid, and we were able to absorb the significant reserve build with strong results in our Markets and Investment
Banking businesses.
Overall, client engagement remains strong, bolstered by increased digital acquisition and engagement. And while
our Consumer business has been impacted by COVID-19-related lower levels of activity, we have seen a pickup
through the quarter. That said, we did see a significant headwind from the full quarter impact of the lower rate
environment.
Looking to the third quarter and the rest of 2020, we expect the environment to continue to remain challenging
and uncertain. On the top line, we expect to see continued pressure in Consumer, reflecting the impact of rates
and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19. And we would also expect the low rate environment to continue
to weigh on our accrual businesses in ICG.
Our Markets and Investment Banking businesses should reflect broader industry trends. That said, we would
expect a normalization relative to the first half. Based on our best estimate, we would expect these headwinds in
the back half of the year to result in full year revenues that are flat to down slightly, with the decline in net interest
revenues more or less offset by noninterest revenues on a full year basis.
On the expense side, we remain focused on protecting our employees and supporting our customers. And we
continue to feel good about the investments we are making, particularly in our digital capabilities and
infrastructure and control. That said, we continue to explore all opportunities to operate more efficiently to fund
these investments and offset headwinds created by COVID-19. And overall, we still expect expenses to be flattish
to down slightly for the full year.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
Turning to credit, we do expect a higher level of losses going forward, given our current outlook. However, this
should be offset by the release of existing reserves. Of course, the overall level of reserves in the back half of the
year remains dependent on the environment relative to our current outlook.
So to wrap up, we're preparing for a range of outcomes and remain confident in our ability to maintain our overall
strength and stability, as well as continue to support our customers.
With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Glenn Schorr with

Yeah, we can hear you loud and clear.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Sorry about that. My apologies. A quick question on Cards. In your comments you mentioned doing less balance
transfer and tighter credit box, impacting revenues. Could you dimensionalize maybe what portion of the book or
remind us what portion of the book is promotional, where this might take it to, and how much pressure we're
talking about on the card side? Appreciate it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. This is Mark. Good morning, Glenn. Look, I'd say a couple of things we're seeing take place. We're,
obviously, managing through a crisis here. And what we've seen is we've seen less purchase sale activity, less
loan volume take place, and frankly, less new card acquisitions, both on the Branded side as well as the Retail
side.
And in light of that, in light of the environment that we're in, we've dialed back the marketing spend, we've dialed
back Balcon and the like. And what happens, as you know, is that as you dial back that level of spending, in the
future you don't get the increase in average interest-earning balances, loan balances that ultimately drive forward-
looking revenues.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
And so, the comment there is simply meant to suggest, as we prudently manage through this crisis, we've needed
to dial back. We've decided to dial back that spend, and I think what's critically important is that we turn that back
on as this crisis turns around. And that's the way we're kind of planning, so that we start to get those promotional
balances picking back up as the economy turns, as GDP turns, as unemployment falls, and we can start growing
those balances again.
So that mix, as you know, is very important. It will be pressured as we manage through this, but then we want to
be very responsive to the economy as it changes, which is, frankly, different from the way it was handled in the
past.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
All fair. All prudent. I get it. And apologies if I missed it in the prepared remarks, related to the reserve build, I get
that there's multiple scenarios, a lot of variables. But can you talk about where we were at the end of the first
quarter versus where we're at the end of the second quarter, and the economic backdrop that you wrote reserves
to? Just so we can do the compare and contrast. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. Let me try and dimension that a little, because I think it's important, first, to kind of understand how we
approach the CECL modeling. And then I'll share with you the variables, the key variables that we used in the
second quarter here, specifically.
So, remember, as we approach CECL, we've got to take a view on the forward look of the economic environment.
And the way we've approached that is we've established models in order to forecast those reserve levels. And we
use one scenario for that. We use a base scenario for the modeling of that.
In addition to that base scenario, which drives the quantitative output in the way of the level of reserves, we have
a quantitative approach that drives a management adjustment. And that management adjustment is designed to
account for the economic uncertainty and the prospect of a more severe stress or a slower recovery. And so
those two components become important to how we've established the reserve both in the first quarter and in the
second quarter.
In the first quarter, more [indiscernible] (00:34:33) second quarter to more specifically answer your question, the
base economic forecast called for US unemployment peaking at roughly 15% or so in the second quarter and
GDP falling 35%-plus quarter-over-quarter.
Now, what's important is the shape and the pace of the recovery, including whether we see a significant second
wave of the virus or what impact the crisis has on broader employment, et cetera, and our base scenario as GDP
recovering sequentially in the third quarter and beyond and hovering, call it, under 10% by the end of the fourth
quarter of 2020, and then trending down from that through the fourth quarter of 2021.
And these assumptions kind of assume a potential second wave, but one that is controlled. It assumes
appropriate fiscal response, if needed, to maintain that pace of recovery, but there's a lot of uncertainty there. And
that kind of drives the quantitative approach. And then, we consider the probability of an alternative downside
scenario, and we build additional reserves as appropriate to that.

And so, if you think about our total reserves, which show up on page 20, I think, which stand at about $28.5 billion
in terms of the ACL reserves, that includes roughly a $2.2 billion or so, $2.3 billion or so additional management
adjustment to account for the possibility of a more adverse outcome.
And so hopefully that helps. We've got a very specific base scenario; then we look at a more stressed scenario,
severely more stressed scenario; and we put a probability to that in order to establish what our management
adjustments should be. And that's what's in the $28.5 billion that sits today.

Could you talk a bit about the timing of when you think the charge-offs will actually start to go up? And, obviously,
you've alluded to the large reserves, and that may or may not hit earnings entirely. But just as we think about the
loss recognition, maybe you can speak to when you think we might start seeing that and what peak levels and
when. And, obviously, it might vary by region, so any thoughts on those topics would be helpful. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. So we are – if you kind of look at the information that we've reported, we aren't yet seeing significant NCLs
as of yet. We aren't yet seeing – there're some increases, but we aren't yet seeing significant NCLs. We aren't yet
seeing meaningful increases in even the 30 to 89 buckets. In fact, they're declining.
So if you look at kind of North America, the 30 to 89 delinquencies declined sequentially in Branded Cards; in
Retail Services, they were relatively stable. In Asia, in Mexico, they declined as well, all in our supplement. And
part of that is because, as you know, there are government payroll protection programs. There's stimulus checks.
There are unemployment benefits. There are all of these things that are in place in many ways to kind of prop up
the economy. And so we aren't yet seeing the stress, if you will, kind of play through those early buckets.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
What I would say is that as we get through the back half of the year and towards the back half of the year, we're
likely to see NCL start to pick up and we're likely to see some of that, at least from the Consumer side, start to
peak towards the middle of next year. But I think what you've got to keep in mind is that we're building reserves
now around lifetime expected losses. And so, to the extent that the forecast plays out as the scenario would
suggest, you'll see those losses pick up. And all things being equal, as it relates to balances, you'll also see the
reserves used to cover those losses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then just on a follow-up, I mean, this is the first cycle that we've all been through with CECL. And I always
think about there's all these reserves being built that you're supposed to use as charge-offs hit, but that kind of
assumes that you know charge-offs aren't going to go up kind of beyond the level of reserves, right? So like, if
charge-offs are going up, but the macro environment continues to get worse, you don't really know if you should
be using reserves or not.
So I guess I'm just wondering, like, it should be a little bit more coincident in terms of using reserves as charge-
offs go up than maybe before CECL. But I would assume like the back half this year, for example, when charge-
offs go up, like you're not going to be using reserves yet until you're confident that the macro is not going to be
worse than you've reserved for, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Again, I think in every quarter, we're going to be taking a view on the forward economic outlook. And so, a little bit
to your point, if we get into the third quarter and we're seeing that our outlook is consistent with what it was at the
end of the second quarter, then we're going to take a view – balances in terms of loans, all things being equal
related to balances, we're going to take a view as to whether we think that economic environment is going to be
as we've scenario-ed it out, get better or worse and act with the reserves accordingly.
I think the other thing that I'd point out to your question is that, remember when I described how we established
the reserves, we've also built this management adjustment, this qualitative approach, which is meant to account
for some of that uncertainty and the prospect for a yet worse scenario.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I hate to ask yet another question on the reserve, but just wanted to make sure we got the right takeaways from
everything that you just said, Mark. As we think about your current outlook for the economy, are you done with
significant reserve building? And in that case, in terms of what you're alluding to, should we assume that once the
charge-offs actually starts to manifest, that's drawn against your reserves, and you have a longer, reasonable,
and supportable period versus peers? And I'm wondering as investors start evaluating banks on normalized
earnings, how we should think about the end-state reserve-to-loan ratio relative to that longer RNS period?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. I guess, here's the way I think about it, which is – obviously, you've heard us say in say in terms of the
uncertainty, unprecedented crisis, we've taken a view on our forward-look of the economy and how it plays out.
And that is, in fact, a view that drives what we've established in the way of reserves.
Now, we're sitting at reserve levels of $28.5 billion, 3.9% or so of funded, 7% against the Global Consumer Bank
in terms of against balances. The ICG at 1.7%; even within the ICG, noninvestment-grade is nearly 5%, 4.9% in
terms of the reserves against the loan balances.
We're sitting with reserves that we feel the level – we feel comfortable about the level of reserves that we have.
But that is, for all the reasons that I described, tied to the scenario that I've described for you, a scenario where
we see the meaningful drop in GDP this quarter, but we also see a recovery sequentially in the third quarter and
unemployment start to fall by the fourth quarter.
And so, to the extent that those things [audio gap] (00:44:00) a little bit of room there, I would say, because I do
have a management adjustment, then I would expect that the first half would reflect, by and large, the majority of
the reserves that we would need to take. And as losses started to play out, that we'd be utilizing that reserve in
order to cover them. So hopefully, that helps.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yes, that helps. And I'll follow-up offline on normalized reserves, but I wanted to get the second question in. Your
peer earlier today noted that we should essentially cut trading revenues in half for the second half of the year in
terms of normalization. And should we be doing the same for Citi for the second half of the year? And I suspect
probably more applicable to the fixed side than the equity side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. Look, we have seen very strong performance in our Markets business and in FICC in particular with up
68% and, if you adjust for the gain that we had last year, is up as much as close to 90%, little bit under 90%. So
very strong performance there. I did mention in my prepared remarks that we would expect to see our Markets
revenue, our Investment Banking revenue normalize in the back half of the year. And I think that certainly holds in
terms of what we're expecting.

And I also gave a little bit of guidance in terms of how to think about full year performance, and that should,
hopefully, inform how to kind of model our performance. I talked about total revenues or full year revenues that
are flat to down slightly, with a decline in net interest revenue that's more or less offset by noninterest revenues
on a full year basis.
And I think if you – you can kind of model that out, and it will, I think, reflect that normalization that I'm speaking to
with regard to Markets, which will show up in both, but you'll see a good part of the normalization in the non-near.

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I have a few questions, so I'll ask a couple, then I'll requeue at the back, if that's okay. But, Mike, the one line
that got me was that we will be struggling until we get a vaccine, which might be correct. Nobody really knows
how this is going to play out, but that's a little bit more pessimistic than some of the guidance given by others. And
certainly, the timeframe for a vaccine is uncertain, too.
So I'm just trying to reconcile the comment that – and the reserves are fine. It sounds like the second quarter
reserve build is a high watermark, so that's reflecting everything. On the other hand, if we have to wait until we get
a vaccine – and also, you did mention Mexico not having the stimulus, and we have had some data since the end
of the quarter that looks a little bit worse.
So, I guess my question is, Mike, how confident are you that you've built enough reserves as of the second
quarter in light of what you said about Mexico, the vaccine, and what's taken place since quarter end?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Louis Corbat A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. Thank you, Mike. So let me just kind of touch on the comment in terms of the vaccine. As we think of – as I
think of this health pandemic, and not necessarily specific dates, but a broad-based timeline, effectively, I think of
this going through four stages: containment, stabilization, normalization, and ultimately a return to growth.
I would describe that today, the economy as we've seen, the global economy, the global health pandemic is not
all in the same place. We didn't enter it at the same time. We didn't have the same response either from a health
or from a fiscal or monetary perspective. And therefore, we're going to see exit and exit rates different, and we're
going to actually see the numbers in terms of resurgence of COVID in some areas in different ways.
I would describe right now that broadly in the world, we are somewhere between containment and stabilization,
right? Containment is that we can bend the curve in terms of the transmission of cases. Stabilization is that as we

remove or start to take down some of the barriers or actions that were put in place, working remotely, social
distancing, kind of all of those things that have been put there. And as those start to get lifted, that you actually
don't see cases come back.
And when you get to the third phase around normalization, and simply put normalization to me is, am I willing to
get on the airliner, am I willing to get in a subway, am I willing to go into a crowded venue to watch a sporting
event or a concert, or what it may be. And I think realistically, when we get to that third bucket, I just don't see that
coming. And I would say many don't see that coming until we feel like there's an antivirus – a vaccine that's
available for the mass population around that.
And so, I think one of the things that people struggle with today is the disconnect in some ways between where
the market is in some ways and actually where we are in terms of this health pandemic and the number of
questions that are out there. So, I don't want to be pessimistic in there. I want to be a realist, and I just think that in
order to truly normalize, that's what's necessary to do that.
To the second part of your question, we've seen different responses in different ways. We've seen different health
responses. We have seen different economic responses. And I think the approach specific to your question in
terms of Mexico is that, in both cases, those responses have been pretty straightforward, right? We really haven't
seen the extraordinary actions that we've seen from the US or UK or some of the governments around the world.
It's been much more of a BAU response and I think as part of that, we're seeing that economy being hit fairly
hard. And it's still, relatively speaking, in the earlier stages. And by the way, that's not just Mexico, more of Latin
America and other parts of the world. And I think as we forecast growth rates going forward, I think our forecast
right now is for a contraction of about 8% in Mexico in terms of GDP as we look forward.
So, the economy has been hit, will continue to be hit. That being said, I think the actions that we've taken in terms
of – the risk approach we've taken in terms of the ways that we have looked at and been mindful in terms of risk
going into this, I think should serve us well. But again, I think the effects of this are likely to be felt longer in
Mexico.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Louis Corbat A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Oh, assumption, assumptions, I'm sorry. Sure, yeah. Well, to me, right, if we want to characterize what's
happening in this, in some cases as a resurgence or the second round of this, one is I would say that we've seen

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
both societal and behaviors changing, right, that I think what we've seen in the states where we've seen
resurgence is in some ways a dichotomy of the population.
I think those that have reverted back to original protocols from the early stages of COVID and what needs to be
done, and I think those that are, I think, being much more – for lack of a better term – free spirited or kind of
moving forward with their lives. And I think you can see that in the spend rates that while these cases have had a
resurgence, we've seen spend come back off in some of those places, but we haven't seen it necessarily go back
to the lower levels of the darkest days of early COVID.
I think the second thing in there, and it's in all of the national health reports, is that the demographics have
changed. We were actually seeing – and part of it can be attributed maybe to testing or more mass testing, but
we're actually seeing the average age of the infected population coming down. Round one, it was in the 50- to 50-
year-plus range on average, and the last numbers I saw coming out had the most recent cases in these states
actually in the mid-30s as an average, and so we're actually seeing a different demographic in there. And again, I
think that has some impact in terms of the way people respond and what spend and what other things are.
And to Mark's earlier point, Mike, just finishing on this, I think that what we're seeing is that the extraordinary
actions of the Fed and the Treasury leave, not just ours, but industry models, kind of wanting for more insight. But
we've never seen this type of action, and whether it's the checks people receive, whether it's payroll protection,
500-plus billion dollars, whether it's the holiday in terms of income tax payments, but we're actually seeing a
consumer in the US that actually kind of goes into this, and it's not all even, but in pretty good shape.
Savings rates are up. Obviously, spending levels are down. Mark talked about some of the delinquencies and
some of the positive things that we're seeing there in terms of the buckets and the roll rates. It's early. But again, I
think, as we look at a potential spike back up in some areas, obviously, over the weekend, stimulus round two
came on the table. It seems to be bipartisan, and so it's likely we're going to get more from that. And so, again, I
think those things give us – I won't say comfort, but give us, I think, a good view based on what we've been
through in terms of the consumer, in particular, to be able to withstand some of these variations in contagion rates
as we go forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So a 10-second summary, your $28.5 billion of reserves, as we stand here at July 14, reflect all that – the 8%
contraction in Mexico, some spending come off, some spike in cases, and everything else that's out there now.
It's not like the first quarter where you had all this new information. The $28.5 billion is your best estimate now for
your future losses under CECL?
[indiscernible] (00:55:37)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Louis Corbat A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. And the one correction I would make to that, Mike, is it's not – again, we closed in our view is as of the
quarter-end is as of June 30. But again, the models are very sensitive to unemployment, they're sensitive to GDP.
And as we went through last quarter, as we were doing different flashes, those numbers moved around. So again,
the models are sensitive to those inputs. And my guess is as those inputs continue to change, there'll be variation.
But absolutely as of quarter-end, we are comfortable with where we set those and the reserving around that.

Mark, you gave us good detail in the slides, as you pointed out on the commercial portfolio, the wholesale
portfolio, and you showed us some of the migration trends from AAA to BBB, et cetera. Can you share with us
what percentage of the corporate portfolio was reviewed and was downgraded? And second, how often do you
now need to review the portfolio for potential future, either upgrades or downgrades in that portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. So look, we are constantly reviewing the portfolio, and we've ramped that up – that timing up significantly
as we've managed through this crisis. There're obviously – I'd start by saying kind of all companies, all sectors
have been impacted by this. Obviously, there's some more significantly impacted than others. When I think about
sectors that drove a good portion of the reserve build that we've seen is I think about aviation, I think about
energy, I think about autos, commercial real estate to some extent, and retails – retailing. And that combination
probably drove a third of the build that we saw. We did see significant downgrades through the quarter, and you
heard me reference the non-investment-grade reserves sitting at 4.9% of the loan balances. And so, we are
actively reviewing the portfolio, as you would imagine.
We're looking at both the 80% investment grade, the 20% non-investment grade of our balances, and we're
adjusting that accordingly, and we'll continue to do that through the quarter, and continue to work through the
entire book. Just to put it in perspective, there were probably a couple of thousand names that were involved in
the driving of the downgrades. And so, there're meaningful names and meaningful review and assessment that
we go through in the quarter.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
Very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, shifting over to the consumer side in the slides once again, you
gave us the relief efforts that you're making with some of your customers for forbearance, I guess you could call it,
in credit cards, mortgage, et cetera. It's a two-part question. Is there any way of you, Citigroup, finding out what
percentage of those customers are unemployed, but receiving enhanced unemployment benefits so that the
delinquencies across in your portfolios as well as your peers are quite low, and part of the reason possibly is due
to these unemployment benefits being so beneficial to the people that are unemployed? Is there any way of
carving out the higher-risk components of these forbearance areas where they could end up turning into charge-
offs later in the year or next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. Look, we're constantly, again, reviewing the portfolio. But in terms of specific unemployment information,
that's something that we have available to us as we work with our customers and review their specific credit
statistics. So, we don't have that.
We do have, as you know, the early signs of both customers who were – who took advantage of the forbearance
globally, and them still paying. So, we've got – if you think about it globally, we have 40% to 60% of the customers
that were – that are enrolled in the consumer relief programs continue to make payments, and they are
contractually obligated to do so, almost 50% in Branded Cards and 40% in Retail, and again, high numbers
around the globe. So, that is a good sign that people are benefiting from the program, and taking those benefits
and applying them to their exposures. And the other important stat that I think is a good indicator, and probably
gets a little bit closer to what you're trying to get a sense for is that the first-time enrollment volumes have come
down significantly.
While we're offering reenrollment, the rates are running below expectation, and they're kind of in the mid-teens, so
to speak, or right around there, and more than half of the total enrollments that have rolled off to-date, and over
80% of those remain current. And so, we're seeing good signs of those rolling off enrollment continuing to remain
current, which we think is a positive indicator.
That said, we said it a couple of times on the call now, there's still some uncertainty – fair amount of uncertainty
out there in terms of how this thing continues to evolve, but good leading indictors between purchase sales,
between reenrollment levels, between continued payment both on and off the programs.

Thank you. Mark, was hoping you could drill down a little bit on the outlook for consumer revenues. You
mentioned the outlook for continued pressure on the top line there. Just wondering, it sounded like maybe you're

seeing some improvement in Asia. You're down 15% revenues in the quarter, but it sounded like maybe a little bit
of improvement there. Latin America, I wasn't sure. So, maybe just a little bit of dimensioning what you see in the
outlook for consumer revenues, international and domestic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yes, sure. So look, I mean, I think that we're going to continue to see pressure on the consumer revenue line. And
I think that, as you know, if we think – if you just kind of take them in pieces very quickly, in the US, our Branded
Cards, our Retail Services, the unemployment stats are very important indicators for those businesses. You know
what those stats are. We've seen – while we've seen improvement in purchase sales, they're still down in the 20s
year-over-year. And so, we do expect that we will see continued pressure on the loan activity there, and so – and
as a result, continued top line pressure on the consumer business domestically.
Similarly, when I look at Asia, for example, there, we have a large card business. We're focused on the wealth
segment there. Again, purchase sales are still under pressure there. The nature of that activity in cards skews
towards travel, and Mike commented on the prospect of travel recovering and what that looks like in the future.
And so, we'd expect to see continued pressure in Asia. Similarly, there's pressure in the insurance business that's
there in light of the face-to-face interaction that's involved, and in Mexico as well, just given the GDP deceleration.
So, I think consumer will continue to have some top line pressure. I think the underlying indicators there are still
strong for us in terms of the deposit growth, in terms of the client engagement, in terms of the digital access and
use of our offering. And so, we've got good indicators, including investment AUMs in Asia that show positive signs
as we come out of this. But as we're managing through it, we're going to have top line pressure there.

Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. So, in Latin America, in Mexico, specifically, as Mike suggested, we're seeing continued pressure from a
GDP point of view. They are later in the cycle in terms of addressing or managing through this COVID-19
situation. There's likely to be some continued pressure on employment there. And so, I think there's going to be
top line pressure in Latin America consumer, Mexico in particular, as we go through this as well. That said, I feel
good about where we're positioned. We kind of started to dial back lending activity a little bit in some of the prior
quarters. I think we're well-positioned from a reserve point of view. And I think we're positioned for when Mexico
recovers from this to continue to kind of gain ground there given some of the investments we've made in the prior
years.

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Maybe just a quick question for Mike. I know there've been a lot of changes in Hong Kong, still a
big piece of your portfolio. And with the operations over there, is there any change in how you're thinking about
the business there and how you think about that on a go-forward basis to start?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Louis Corbat A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, Brian, I would say, one, is that, I think as we look at the region, you can't just look at Hong Kong. I think
you've got to take a bit of a broader view. And the word I would use is that, it's complex, right? We've got the
combination of a sideline trade deal with China. You've got the interaction between China and Hong Kong. You've
got the recent announcement or creation of this new national security law, which is, I think, fairly specific in terms
of calling out financial support in terms of China against its sovereignty with significant penalties around that. And
so, I think we've got to be mindful of all those.
From our perspective, we've been in Hong Kong a long time. It's an important place. It's our Asian hub as we
operate in a number of countries there. And I would say a couple of important things to that: one is we do obey
local laws; second is that our goal really is to be there to support our clients, and that we're fairly used to
operating in charge to complex environments. And as part of that, I think we have found both the Hong Kong
government, and the HKMA and others very supportive of our business and our approach. And at the same time,
we have, I think received the same support from China, and haven't, in any way, kind of received restrictions or
other things from them. So obviously, it's something we pay close attention to. It's important to us. But obviously,
we're committed to being there, and obviously are monitoring things closely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. And a separate question. Mark, you mentioned that in the Retail Services that there was some pressure
from partner payments. So, are those higher partner payments fully in the run rate now or should we expect those
to kind of increase on a go-forward basis? And what were those exactly? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. So, as you know, we've got a number of partners that make up our Retail Services partner business, and
many of these arrangements call for sharing of profitability, so contractual profitability sharing between us and the
partners. And we will determine that based on our outlook in any given quarter for the balance of the year. And so
– and we make an estimate for what we think profitability will look like, and then we obviously account for the
share that goes to the partner in the revenue line. That profitability estimate excludes ACLs, so the reserves that
we've been building. It does include any NCLs that we realize. And so, important to note that, again, when we're
calculating that the lifetime reserves that we're building, despite the fact that we will share them when they
become losses, that's excluded from the profitability estimate.
And so essentially, what's happened and what's caused part of the drag in Retail Services is that we've seen the
losses that we expect from Retail Services push out beyond kind of 2020. As I mentioned earlier, we see good
signs in some of the early buckets. And as such, our view as to when those losses will actually come through as

NCLs has been pushed out into 2020. As a result, 2021 – sorry, 2021. As a result, the 2020 view on profitability
for some of these partners has gone up. And therefore, the amount of sharing has increased, thus putting
pressure on the top line.
To answer the other part of your question, so we believe at this stage, based on our view for the balance of the
year that we've accounted for the level of profit sharing that we would expect. But as things evolve, we will need
to adjust accordingly.

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. So, Mark, I want to go back to CECL and get your
perspective on the stickiness of CECL reserves as these charge-offs start to happen, and I guess, the willingness
to release reserves because I think we've all been focused on reserve builds, when do we see the peak in
reserves, and less focus on what happens in the cadence and pace of releasing reserves and declines in the
reserves as the actual losses start to occur.
And I mean, as you know, CECL kind of works backwards. Every given quarter, you need to – you estimate what
your lifetime losses are in your portfolio, your charge-offs, and kind of back into a plug with loan loss provision.
So, I'm curious, given all the uncertainty that we are – we still have, and will likely continue to see whether as you
start to see charge-offs start to materialize in whenever, the fourth quarter or the beginning part of next year in a
more material way, whether there is sort of a bias to maybe maintain reserve levels at fairly high levels and not
necessarily release reserves because even if we're not – even if reserve releases aren't happening or we're not
building reserves as charge-offs happen, that could imply that provision in credit costs remain pretty high for a
while.
So, I'm curious whether you think there will be sort of a hesitancy or a natural inclination to kind of wait it out and
have a little bit more stickiness in the reserve levels until we get more clarity on all of the things going on in the
world.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
I think it largely depends on our outlook at that point in time in that given quarter. I mean there's just no – there's
no other way for me to kind of explain it. When we get into the – we're in the third quarter now. As we go through
the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we will have a view, a forward-looking view.
And if that forward-looking view is still meaningfully uncertain to worse than it was in the second quarter, then we
will likely continue to have to adjust reserves accordingly. If that forward-looking view...

that's the way I think about it. And I think that's how it's probably going to work.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And I guess maybe just getting more granular even in that, I guess if there's – if your baseline
economic yield, I know you only use once near, your baseline hasn't changed or even gotten – maybe getting a
little bit better, but you still have a high degree of uncertainty and potential in the range of the outcomes, some of
which are far worse, I would assume that your qualitative adjustments will factor that in, in some way, shape or
form, is that and...

adjustment that should be there.

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. First question, just on expenses. Mark, you've done a very nice job this year keeping the
level flat in that $10.4 billion, $10.5 billion zone. Through the first half, you got $3 billion more revenue and flat
expenses. And I heard your point earlier that you expected to keep it flattish from here. Given that we'll see a
likely decline in second half revenues from here, though, can you talk about just what optionality you do have to
adjust the cost base lower, given your point about supporting employees, investing in technology, and then the
pushes and pulls of compensation, staff levels, et cetera? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. Thank you. So, I guess a couple of things. One is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that I do expect
that we will maintain our full-year expenses roughly flattish, and that's what we're kind of managing to. And part of
that against revenues that are flat to slightly down, and if you think about what we're managing through in the
midst of this crisis, we've got a lot of puts and takes. So, we've got some headwinds that kind of fall into a bunch
of different categories, including the things we do to support our employees, including building out our collection
capabilities, including enhancing our fraud detection capabilities, all of which I think are important to ensuring that
we're managing through this crisis in a thoughtful and responsible way, sanitization of buildings, ensuring that
people have remote access and the equipment to support that. All of those things come with cost, cost that we
were not planning for in the year.
There're obviously some tailwinds. So, we've got marketing expenses that you heard me mention, we've dialed
back. We've got T&E expenses because people are doing more Zoom than they are traveling to meet with clients.
And so, you've got some tailwinds there that offset that. But net-net, when you think about those expenses,
they're headwinds for us. We also have investments that we will continue to make; investments in technology;
investments in enhancing our digital capabilities, which have proven to be quite valuable as we manage through
this crisis; investment in infrastructure and controls that to ensure that we not only protect the franchise, but we're
improving our efficiency in operations, and improving the quality of our data, et cetera, et cetera.
And then we've got productivity initiatives and the other levers that pull or that we do pull quite naturally with
revenues. And so, the compensation expenses, obviously, will adjust accordingly. The transaction expenses will
adjust with how we see volumes move, and we'll continue to deliver on our productivity savings in the way of right
placement and reducing our number of centers and the like. And so, yes, there're levers, but there're also
meaningful headwinds, and that's kind of how I get to that outlook of roughly flattish as we manage through this
particular year?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
...just on capital. This year, you've been bound a little bit more on CET1 by the advanced approaches, with
advanced RWAs a little bit higher than standardized. It's only about 20 basis points, but as we get into the SCB
construct, can you do anything to optimize the advanced RWAs vis-à-vis the standardized approach, and how
much of a focus will that be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. Look, I mean, we've part of – a big part of kind of what's driving the advanced – the downgrades that are
associated with the crisis that we're managing through. And so that is a factor that's likely to persist for a while,
and we're actively managing and optimizing the balance sheet to identify ways to impact or reduce that risk-
weighted assets or – and aid in the calculation here of the CET1, and – but that is the headwind that we've got to
manage.
Now what I'd point out is that the regulatory minimum for CET1 in both standardized and advanced is running at
about 10%. And so, we sit on an advanced basis at a ratio, as Mike and I have said at 11.5%. So, we're still 150
basis points above that regulatory minimum, which we think gives us room to manage through this period of
uncertainty, and a range of different outcomes. It also gives us room if you think about some of the additional
stress analysis that's in front of us in the industry. So, yes, advanced. Yes, a byproduct of the crisis we're. Yes,
we're constantly looking to manage it effectively where that makes sense, and where we can continue to serve
our clients in a way that is right for the franchise.

Hey. Good morning. Mark, maybe just can you help us unpack a little bit the – how we think about the trajectory of
NII? What – how do you – deposits – flight-to-safety deposits have been stickier than I would have thought still
seeing growth in deposits. What are your assumptions, I guess, around balance sheet growth and NIM? Where
do you see kind of NIM bottoming out? Those kind of things would be, I think, helpful in just understanding your
assumptions versus ours?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. So look, we – I kind of mentioned in my opening remarks that we obviously saw a NIM decline some 31
basis points quarter-over-quarter. And that's a combination again of lower rates, the loan mix shift that we've
seen, so lower NIM cards and higher ICG in terms of that mix and the balance sheet expansion, which is really a
reflection of the strong growth in deposits and the solid liquidity position that we have.
And so, when I think about that dynamic, we are likely to continue to see, as I mentioned, pressure on our cards
lending activity around the globe. We're likely to kind of continue to see rates kind of impact some of our banking
businesses, businesses like TTS, and the like. And as a result, I think that we'll continue to see some pressure on
the NIM line in the outer quarters. But again, I'd point you back to the total revenue forecast that are given
because, obviously, there are other components here, and that getting back to flattish to slightly down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
No. I mean, that's all fair. I just was curious if you're assuming a flattish balance sheet or further growth.
Obviously, I've heard your comments on some of the pressures, just trying to figure out what your base case
assumption is for the balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. In the balance sheet, we'll see – there'll likely be some growth in the balance sheet, but that will be driven
by the client demand that we see out there and our ability to meet that, but we will likely see some continued
growth in the balance sheet from a GAAP asset point of view.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. And just as a follow-up on capital. I mean, what is your – Mike, do you think you need to see, getting back
to your earlier comments, need to see a vaccine before the banks can sort of confidently return to buybacks? Or
do you think just – you just need to have a little more stable macro data? How do you think about returning to
buybacks given your capital position? Obviously, you can't do it in the third quarter, but beyond that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Louis Corbat A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. I think it's based on, as we look and project forward, what we see from an economic perspective and
obviously, what's going on in the economy, both consumer and institutional, and how we're projecting loss and
loss rates that going forward. And do we feel comfortable about the trajectory of the pandemic, and using my
timeline, do we feel like we're somewhere in that stabilization moving to normalization, right?
So, I think in here, there's the fear that as we get into colder weather, maybe that's now been debunked with
Florida and Texas and others. But in the fall, maybe we start to see a resurgence in some of these things spike
up. I think, we'd like to see this roll over and have some comfort that we've got the ability to keep it down and that,
again, we see a better sense. I'm not sure what the new normal is, but we see a better sense of normalcy,
whatever that is returning to the global economy.

Charles Peabody Q
Analyst, Portales Partners, LLC
Couple of questions regarding your capital – your tax position and how it affects your capital. First, in the stress
test, I believe the CARES Act provided some capital relief around your tax position. I was wondering if that was
true, and if you could size that?
And secondly, going forward, if tax rates are raised, as Biden suggests, how much would that enhance your CET1
ratio?
And then finally, I think Jamie Dimon this morning implied that he would love to restart buybacks sometime in the
fourth quarter after the election. I'm curious if you saw buybacks as a regulatory issue or a political issue. Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Okay. In terms of the CARES Act, there is a benefit associated with that. I don't think that it is significant in our
case to the CET1 ratio, but I don't have that specific number in front of me.
In terms of the tax rate and the prospect of the rollback of taxes, that will come with many, many puts and takes,
including the impact to the DTA and other things that we have across the firm. And so, I apologize, I don't have
the exact math on that, but we can certainly kind of...

I was going to say, Charles, the other piece that you've seen in our tax rate is, given the breadth of our business,
we haven't necessarily enjoyed the benefit that the more fully US-centric institutions have had. And so, again,
ours would be the blend of US versus international. And in that tax rate going up, again, I don't think we would go
back to a global taxation system. We would stay a territorial system, which again, vis-à-vis some US
counterparties could, on a relative basis, would probably be to our benefit.
And I think to your final point, I view when the US industry made the decision to go ahead and to stop buybacks. It
was not political. It was done, we thought, from a prudence perspective of the right thing, not knowing what to
expect going into this. I don't view this today as being political. I view it as – and as the fed has said, it will
ultimately be our choice to come back and to reinstate buybacks at the right time. And again, as we said in the
previous questions, we'll be monitoring that. And when the time is right, we'll be back in there filing to re-begin or
to begin the buybacks.

Hey, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Two quick questions. One on Mexico, I know a couple of years back you invested something around $1 billion in
the infrastructure there. And I'm wondering is that investment finished, completed? And is it now in the run rate?
Or does that represent a level of funding that could then come out and pay for other things? Is it an efficiency
opportunity is basically the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
So, yes, we did announce an investment a number of years ago. We are largely through that. I think we got to
somewhere – probably 80% or somewhere through having deployed that investment. What is left does serve as a
lever for us that we consider as we take on these decisions. And just keep in mind, those investments were made
in building out, enhancing our technology and branches and digital capabilities and the like. And so, I think they've
certainly been beneficial, but we are largely through that, and what's left is available to us to toggle as we need to
here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then as I flip to the US, could you give us an update on where you are with the efforts to drive deposit
growth in the US? I mean, I obviously see that deposit growth was up, not only in the US but in international in the
quarter, but I'm really kind of honing in here on the consumer side. And you'd had the announcement around
some partnerships with American Airlines and with Google, and so I'd just like to understand where you are in that
strategy, and do you think that there's anything that you can do to drive up the consumer deposit growth in the
back half of this year and into next?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. So, we've had very good consumer deposit growth through the quarter. I think that we benefited from the
investments that we've made in our digital capabilities, as you've seen the digital deposit sales grow meaningfully
as high as $12 billion as we ended the quarter. And we continue to see those benefits play out both in our market
and outside of our markets, which, as you know, has been part of our strategy to ensure that we're leveraging the
breadth of our customer base in cards that has a broader presence in the US than we do in terms of a Retail
Banking footprint. And so, we continue to see those benefits of the strategy play out. Some of that is fueled by
some of the things that I've mentioned earlier in terms of the stimulus that's out there and the delay in terms of tax
payments. But nonetheless, we've been able to capture upside from both new and existing clients, and we expect
to continue to do that through the balance of the year.
I'd also highlight – I know your question was around consumer specifically, but I would also highlight that we're
also seeing very good continued traction on the institutional side in our TTS franchise. And that growth in many
ways is as we've seen and worked very closely with our corporate clients to shore up their liquidity positions,
whether it was early on where they were drawing on lines or in the quarter where we partnered with those same
clients to access the capital markets, we've been kind of that partner of choice, that flight to quality on both the
consumer side in the US and internationally as well as the institutional side.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. No, I figured that institutional was extremely strong. I was just wondering, out of that...

Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q

...is there more room for the consumer to accelerate and kind of move it forward from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. And on the consumer, you've seen it in both the US, you've seen it in Mexico, you've seen it in Asia. We've
had strong consumer growth across all of the regions, but we are pleased with the growth that we're seeing here.
Mike, did you want to add something?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Louis Corbat A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Yes. I would just say the other piece, Betsy, is that, I think, very consistent with what we've spoken about in the
past of that $12 billion that Mark mentioned, two-thirds, which again is a pretty stable number for us is coming
from outside our branch footprint, which we obviously play – we pay close attention to given our branch model.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Two-thirds of the growth in consumer is coming from outside of branch footprint?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020

Operator: Your final question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for letting me have my follow-up questions. So, just to be clear, so you are not guiding for positive
operating leverage this year, Mark. Because earlier, you said, expense is flat to down, and then you said flat. And
it sounds like you're – I know there's a lot of COVID costs that make this a difficult year, but – so no positive
operating leverage this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. I'd repeat what I said earlier, which is revenues kind of slightly down and expenses, flattish, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. I guess – and as far as the equities business, you guys didn't participate as much as others. And help me
with this logic. I mean, you had the corporate drawdowns in March. That was replaced with the fixed income
markets. And now maybe we have a re-equification with more equity activities, and then one of your competitors
showed a lot of pickup in equities. You talk about a normalization in capital markets. Do you expect the equities to
improve? Do you recognize the underperformance? Is it a timing thing? How do you think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Louis Corbat A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. I would say one is let's kind of break the business into a few different buckets. So one, I would say that our
cash trading performance was good. It was strong. And I would say that, again, it's early to see, but we did not do
as well in either of Primer Delta One – Prime Finance Delta One derivatives.
From an equification perspective, if you actually look into our capital markets numbers, you see a very strong
number in ECM that our ECM business was up 56% on a year-over-year basis. So, in terms of the capital raising
aspects of it, we were quite active in most of the headline deals that were done. And so again, cash trading, okay.
We'll see where things come out, but not as good performance in Derivatives Delta One Prime Finance and a
strong performance in terms of ECM.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then just a summary question. Through the course of this call, your stock price went down. You're
underperforming the BTX. It's just one day. I know stocks don't read too much into that. But there is I think a

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 14-Jul-2020
feeling that I'm getting that either you're being more maybe realistic, pragmatic about the realities of the world out
there, and that goes back to your mention about the vaccine.
You're seeing something specific to your franchise that gives you more caution or maybe me and others are just
interpreting your comments too negatively. And I just say that because when you talk about the revenues, the
NIM was down 31 basis points. It still goes lower. You talked about the consumer being under pressure, less
partner payments in Retail Services, ICG normalizes ahead, TTS gets hurt by lower rates. You don't have positive
operating leverage and expenses, the loan losses. You have Mexico with COVID. And we're only somewhere
between containment and stabilization, and no buybacks for some time to come.
So, those are all...
That's a summary of some of the negatives that you had from this call. So; maybe that was unintentional or
maybe that was intentional. So, this is kind of a last chance to either put some positives on the other side, like
with digital banking or deposit growth or things like that or to say, you know what, I'm actually in the camp where
this is going be a long road, and maybe you differ from the rest of the world?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Louis Corbat A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Well, I would start out, Mike, and say that it is not our intention to be negative. I think we're all in this together. And
I would certainly say that the unknowns outweigh the knowns. And if somebody has the crystal ball, I would love
to see it.
But I think what we are seeing and what we've described coming through four very challenging months as the first
half of 2020, with revenues up 8%, expenses flat, our ability to absorb significant reserve builds under the new
format of CECL, broad scale or wide-ranging engagement from our clients, I think you will continue to see in the
numbers as they settle that we continue to take market share.
We've continued to build capital. We've continued to build liquidity, and feel very good about where we are and
how we're going into the second half of the year. The unknowns are the unknowns. We don't know. And that in
there, we're seeing resurgences in places where cases had been down, and they've come back up, and the US is
uneven and the approaches, and the rest of the world have been uneven.
And so again, I would say, we go in, feeling very well-positioned against this. But we don't want people leaving the
call simply thinking that the world is a great place, and it is a V-shaped recovery. It's our view that we will see V,
we will see U, we will see W. And as an institution, we need to be prepared to deal with all of it. And I think you've
seen across our businesses, while in certain areas, revenues have been under pressure that we've managed
through this very well so far. And I'm really proud of the team in terms of what they've done. But again, I don't
think anybody should leave any bank earnings call this quarter simply feeling like the worst is absolutely behind
us, and it's a rosy path ahead. So, feel good about where we are. The environment is unknown. I think the actions
we've taken so far have been spot on, and I think we're well-positioned for what the future brings.

Yeah. All right. Thank you.
