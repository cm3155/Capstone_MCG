Chris Doll
Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today we'll be discussing our financial results
for the third quarter of 2021. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials which can be found in our
earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures along with
information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth
Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of
this call.
This morning, I'm joined by our CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Jamie Leonard; President, Tim Spence; and Chief
Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Jamie, we will open the call up for
questions.
Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported third quarter net income
of $704 million or $0.97 per share. On a core basis, we earned $0.94 per share. Once again, we delivered strong
and steady financial results, while fully supporting our customers, communities and employees.
During the quarter, we generated adjusted ROTCE of nearly 19%, which represents the fifth straight quarter
exceeding 18%. We generated period-end C&I loan growth of 4% compared to the prior quarter excluding the
impact of PPP. Commercial loan production increased 5% from last quarter, representing the strongest quarter
since the fourth quarter of 2019.
We generated strong consumer household growth of 3% compared to last year, with growth in every region in our
footprint reflecting the continued success of our branch and digital initiatives. And, as expected, we generated
positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis.
Our performance this quarter reflected strong business outcomes across our franchise, resulting in improved and
diversified revenues. This was combined with disciplined balance sheet management, expense management and
yet another quarter of benign credit results. We closed the Provide acquisition and the sale of HSA deposits in the
quarter to improve long-term growth and profitability.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Provide, a leading fintech company serving healthcare practices, will further accelerate profitable relationship
growth. The sale of our HSA deposits is part of our multiyear strategy to simplify the organization and prioritize
investments in order to generate differentiated outcomes for our customers and shareholders.
Despite continued pressure from low-interest rates, adjusted PPNR increased 4% compared to year-ago quarter,
highlighting the strong results from our fee-based businesses in retail, mortgage, commercial, and Wealth and
Asset Management.
Excluding impact of PPP, average total loans increased 1% compared to last quarter, reflecting strong
commercial loan production as well as strength in our indirect auto and residential mortgage portfolios.
Commercial loan production increased 5% sequentially with record quarters in corporate banking and middle
market.
Despite some of the challenges we have been hearing from our customers, including supply chain constraints and
labor shortages, the strong production was led by our healthcare, renewable energy and retail verticals and was
well diversified geographically. Our commercial lending production trends, pipelines and retention of the client
relationship all support continued loan growth.
As it relates to Provide, we are very pleased with the progress we have seen so far. We are even more excited
about the opportunities for continued growth. As we have previously mentioned, we expect strong origination
volumes in 2022, reflecting a robust pipeline, added product capabilities and key talent hires. Provide supports a
relationship approach with approximately two-third of customers having either a deposit account or a payments
relationship with Fifth Third.
During the quarter, we recorded a net benefit to credit losses as well as historically low net charge-offs of 8 basis
points, reflecting continued improvement in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. In addition to
historically low credit losses, we experienced another quarter of improvement in criticized assets and NPAs. Our
criticized assets declined nearly 20%. Our NPA ratio declined 9 basis points sequentially. Our NPA and NPL
ratios this quarter have reverted back to pre-pandemic levels. Our strong credit performance reflects disciplined
client selection, conservative underwriting and continued support from fiscal and monetary government stimulus
programs.
Our balance sheet and earnings power remain very strong. As we've said before, we remain focused on
deploying capital into organic growth opportunities, evaluating strategic nonbank opportunities, paying a strong
dividend and share repurchases. Bank acquisitions remain a lower priority.
I'd like to once again thank our employees. I very much appreciate the way you have continually risen to the
occasion for our customers, communities and each other. I'm very proud that in addition to producing strong
financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and the
well-being of our communities.
For our customers, we are excited to roll out Jeanie, our new AI-driven digital assistant in the fourth quarter. This
will drive targeted marketing capabilities, digital engagement and improved customer retention.
For our communities, we made a $15 million contribution to our foundation this quarter as part of our $2.8 billion
commitment to accelerate racial equity, equality and inclusion in our communities. In total, we have contributed
$40 million in philanthropic support since the end of last year

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
We continue to make targeted investments to accelerate economic revitalization as you may have seen in last
week's announcement of Fifth Third's Neighborhood Investment Program. This innovative initiative further
demonstrates our commitment to being an ESG leader in addition to other recent proof points, including
generating over $6 billion towards our $8 billion renewable energy goal to be achieved by 2025; announcing a
new position, Head of Climate Risk, to focus on identifying, measuring and managing the physical and transition
risk of our clients; and a robust transparent and peer-leading ESG disclosure.
In summary, we believe our balancing strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined
management throughout the company will serve us well into 2022 and beyond. We expect to generate positive
operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and also for the full year in 2021.
We remain committed to generating sustainable long-term value and consistently producing through-the-cycle top
quartile results.
With that, I'll turn over to Jamie to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook.

James C. Leonard
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. We're very pleased with our financial results this
quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and
continued discipline on both expenses and credit.
The reported earnings included a $21 million after-tax benefit or $0.03 per share from the three items noted on
page 2 of the release. Our strong business performance throughout the bank is reflected in our return metrics. We
produced an adjusted ROA of 1.32% and an adjusted ROTCE excluding AOCI of 18.7%. Improvements in our
loan portfolio credit quality resulted in a $63 million release to our credit reserves and an ACL ratio of 200 basis
points compared to 206 basis points last quarter. Combined with our historically low net charge-offs, we had a
$42 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses.
Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion increased 2% compared to the
year-ago quarter, reflecting the benefits of our balance sheet positioning, continuing benefits from PPP income
and income from our Ginnie Mae forbearance loan purchases. Our NII results relative to the second quarter
included a $6 million reduction in PPP income, a $4 million decline in prepayment penalties in our investment
portfolio, and the impact of lower earning asset yields, partially offset by a higher day count and a reduction in
long-term debt.
Our allocation to bullet and locked-out structures is currently 60% of the total investment portfolio which is
expected to continue to provide ongoing NII protection in this low-rate environment.
On the liability side, we've reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs another basis point this quarter to 4
basis points. With a highly asset sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion of excess liquidity, we continue to be
well-positioned to benefit when interest rates rise, while also remaining well-hedged if rates remain low, given our
securities portfolio and derivatives.
Total reported noninterest income increased 13% sequentially, impacted by a $60 million gain associated with the
disposition of HSA deposits, as previously communicated. Adjusted noninterest income increased 3%, driven by
strong mortgage banking, treasury management, leasing and Wealth and Asset Management revenues.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Commercial Banking revenue, which achieved record results the past two quarters, remained solid as strength in
M&A advisory fees, particularly in our healthcare vertical was more than offset by lower corporate bond fees.
Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted noninterest income increased 13% with improvement in every single
caption, reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business, as well as the robust economic rebound
over the past year. Our total noninterest revenue was 41% of total revenue in the third quarter.
Reported noninterest expense increased 2% compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the $15 million
foundation contribution. Adjusted expenses were flat sequentially as an increase in marketing expense associated
with Momentum Banking and increased T&E expense were offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits
expense.
Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted noninterest expense increased 2%, primarily driven by an increase in
performance-based compensation, reflecting strong business results, servicing expenses associated with Ginnie
Mae loan purchases and the impact of the Provide acquisition. These items were partially offset by lower card and
processing expense due to contract renegotiation and lower net occupancy expense. On a year-over-year basis,
total adjusted fees have increased 13% compared to just 2% expense growth.
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases declined half of a percent sequentially,
including the headwind from PPP loans. Excluding PPP, average loans and leases increased 1% with period-end
loans up 1.5%, pointing to positive momentum as we head into the fourth quarter.
Average total consumer portfolio loans increased 2% as continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in
residential mortgage balances were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances.
While we did not retain incremental conforming mortgage originations in the third quarter, we have elected to
retain approximately $400 million of our retail mortgage production for the balance sheet in the fourth quarter and
we'll continue to evaluate the economic trade-offs given our balance sheet capacity in this environment.
Average commercial loans declined 2% compared to the prior quarter due entirely to PPP forgiveness. Excluding
PPP, average commercial loans increased around half of a percent with C&I loans up 2%. Production was robust
across the board, up 5% compared to the prior quarter, with both corporate and middle market banking
generating record production, which was well diversified geographically. As a result, period-end C&I loans,
excluding PPP, increased 4%.
Revolver utilization of 31% was stable compared to the prior quarter. However, it is worth noting that total
commitments have increased approximately $5 billion since the end of last year driven by new client acquisition
and an increase in demand from existing clients in anticipation of future business growth.
Average CRE loans were down 3% sequentially with lower balances in mortgage and construction driven by
elevated pay-offs in areas most impacted by the pandemic, reflecting our cautious approach to those sectors.
Our securities portfolio was stable sequentially. We continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows but will remain patient
on deploying the excess liquidity. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to
begin our excess cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200-basis-point level.
We remain optimistic that continued GDP growth in the Fed's eventual tapering of bond purchases will present
more attractive risk-return opportunities in the future. Average other short-term investments, which includes

interest-bearing cash, remain elevated, reflecting growth in core deposits since the onset of the pandemic, which
are up 6% year-over-year.
Moving to credit. Our strong credit performance this quarter once again reflects our disciplined client selection,
conservative underwriting, prudent balance sheet management and the continued benefit of fiscal and monetary
stimulus programs and improvement in the broader economy.
As Greg mentioned, the third quarter net charge-off ratio of 8 basis points was historically low and improved 8
basis points sequentially. Nonperforming assets declined 15% with the NPA ratio declining 9 basis points
sequentially to 52 basis points. The decline in criticized assets reflected significant improvements in retail non-
essential and leisure, consistent with the reopening of the economy and higher activity in those sectors as well as
improvements in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios. We continue to focus on segments of non-owner
occupied commercial real estate, particularly central business district hotels as activity have not yet returned to
pre-pandemic levels.
Moving to the ACL. Our base case macroeconomic scenario is relatively similar to last quarter, which assumes
the labor market continues to improve, and job growth continues to strengthen, with unemployment reaching 4%
in the first quarter of 2022, and ending our three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.5%.
We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios.
However, our ACL release was lower this quarter as the improvement in the underlying economic forecast
decelerated from the second quarter. Additionally, the ACL requirement in the downside scenario worsened
compared to the second quarter due to a forecasted slower pace of recovery and a larger increase in
unemployment. If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $788 million higher. If
the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $176 million lower.
While the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the
economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, which could play out given the
uncertain environment.
In addition to COVID, we continue to monitor the economic and lending implications of the supply chain and labor
market constraints that currently exist. Our September 30th allowance incorporates our best estimate of the
economic environment with lower unemployment and continued improvement in credit quality.
Moving to capital. Our capital levels remained strong in the third quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at
9.8%. During the quarter, we completed $550 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by
14.5 million shares compared to the second quarter. We also raised our common dividend $0.03, or 11%, to
$0.30 per share. Our capital plans support approximately $300 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter
of 2021 and we continue to target a 9.5% CET1 by June 2022.
Moving to our fourth quarter outlook. We expect average total loan balances to increase 2% sequentially,
excluding the PPP headwind. Including the PPP impact, we expect average total loans to increase approximately
1%.
Our outlook reflects 0.5 point of improvement from commercial revolving line utilization, continued strength in
commercial production given our record pipelines and a continued stabilization in paydowns based on activity that
we are seeing so far in October.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
We expect average C&I growth of 4% to 5%, excluding PPP in the fourth quarter. And CRE balances to decline
around 1% or so, primarily due to construction constraints. As a result, we anticipate total average commercial
loan growth of around 3% sequentially, excluding PPP. We expect average total consumer loan balances to
increase around 1% sequentially, including the impacts of Ginnie Mae forbearance pool purchases and our held-
for-sale portfolio. We purchased $300 million during the third quarter and additional $700 million in early October.
Given our loan outlook, we expect NII to be down 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter, assuming stable securities
balances and a $17 million reduction in PPP income. Excluding PPP, we expect fourth quarter NII to be up slightly
relative to the third quarter.
Our guidance indicates full year 2021 NII declines less than 1% compared to full-year 2020 despite no meaningful
growth in investment securities balances throughout the year and an average decline in 1-month LIBOR of
approximately 40 basis points. We expect NIM to decline 3 to 4 basis points in the fourth quarter, primarily due to
loan yield compression.
We expect fourth quarter fees to increase around 6% compared to the third quarter and to be up around 8% on a
year-over-year basis, excluding the impacts of the TRA. This results in full-year 2021 fee growth, excluding the
impacts of the TRA of approximately 10% compared to 2020.
Our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy, resulting in a record full-year commercial banking revenue
led by 20% growth in capital markets fees, record wealth and asset management revenue up double digits and
double-digit growth in card and processing revenue.
We expect private equity income to be in the $40 million area in the fourth quarter. Our outlook assumes a
sequential decline in top line mortgage revenue of approximately 40%, with roughly half of that decline due to
seasonally lower fourth quarter volumes and declining spreads and half to our decision to retain $400 million in
retail production that I mentioned earlier.
We expect fourth quarter expenses to be stable to up 1% compared to the third quarter, reflecting continued
growth in technology investments, servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae loan purchases and
continued marketing support related to our rollout of Momentum, offset by disciplined expense management
throughout the company and initial savings beginning from our process automation program.
As a result, our full-year 2021 total core revenue growth is expected to exceed the growth in core expenses
despite the rate environment. We will have achieved positive operating leverage in a year in which the vast
majority of the industry will likely experience an erosion in efficiency. We expect total net charge-offs in the fourth
quarter to be in the 10 to 15 basis points range, which would result in full-year 2021 charge-offs of 15 basis points
or so.
In summary, our third quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over
the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle.
We will continue to rely on the same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and a
focus on a long-term performance horizon which has served us well during this environment.
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.

Chris Doll
Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and
one follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as
many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning. Operator, please open the call up for
questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Just wanted to ask a couple questions on loan growth, which looks like it's coming back nicely. First, I was
hoping you could talk about any differences you're seeing in demand between your larger and smaller customers.
Jamie, I think you had mentioned that production sounded pretty strong in both corporate and middle market. So,
any additional color there?
And then second was just wondering if you could speak to the dynamics you're seeing in terms of both pricing and
structure, just in other words, changes to the competitive environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
This is Greg. Let me start off, and then I'll flip it over to Tim, and maybe Jamie. First off, we're very encouraged
what we're seeing from a production perspective. We've got commercial loan production in the third quarter
coming along strong at $5.4 billion. That was up from $5.1 billion in the second quarter and $5.2 billion in the third
quarter 2019. We expect that production to continue to be stable going into the fourth quarter, so that's
encouraging. We expect average loans up 1% with PPP and 2% up without PPP. So, that's some strength there.
We're also seeing line utilization tick up a little bit more in our core middle market, which is nice to see that for a
change.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
So, when you think about our geographies, what we're seeing right now from a geography perspective, North
Carolina, Texas, Cincinnati, Columbus were our top four markets from commercial loan growth in Q3, which is
encouraging.
If you look at six regions that had all-time highs, which we're very encouraged with Chicago, Grand Rapids,
Columbus, Kentucky, North Carolina and Texas. So, that felt really good, and we're starting to see once again
some good momentum out there.
Net new relationships, something we watch very carefully brought in 419 new commercial relationships year-to-
date. Most of that was in core middle market and some of that in large corp. And net-net we're seeing good
progress out there, good performance. Encouraged by what we're seeing to-date as we go into the fourth quarter
and then into 2022. Tim?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yes. Just to add a few points to what Greg mentioned. So, I had the chance to be out in 8 of our 14 regions this
past quarter. I think you get really excellent color when you have an opportunity to sit with clients and with
bankers. I mean, they're all feeling the shortages as it relates to labor and supply chain. We have hotel operators
who are now only cleaning rooms when people leave. As an example, I visited an electronics client out west and
asked to see their demo room, and there was nothing but holes in the walls. I said where is the equipment? And
they had sold all the inventory because they are struggling to get the parts in to be able to fill orders. So, all those
issues are still real.
I think the good news is we are seeing M&A as a catalyst. We're seeing CapEx now as a catalyst in particular for
businesses that are able to substitute equipment and automation for manual processes. And then bluntly, as Greg
mentioned, I think we feel pretty confident that a lot of the improvement we're seeing is just coming from taking
share. I mean, the relationship count Greg mentioned would be higher than where we were at prior to the
pandemic. So, we'll have taken more new relationships onboard this year through nine months than we had in all
of 2018 or 2019, just as an example.
So, good general pickup there. It would be great to continue to see a little bit more activity as it relates to
utilization as folks try to build inventories and otherwise, it's just – that's going to be the wildcard for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Jamie, let me add one thing. And Scott, also if you look at our verticals, which I should have mentioned is, our
largest production, the areas we're seeing the larger strength in right now is technology, media, telecom, our
retailers, financial institutions are all going well. So, we're seeing some good momentum in those spaces.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
And then, Scott, to answer the second part of your question, in terms of the segments, I think Greg and Tim did a
nice summary there. What we're seeing from a line utilization perspective is that the middle market line utilization
is up almost 1% whereas corporate banking continues to trend down. So, quarter-over-quarter, that utilization was
stable. And if we want to go into the decimals, it was 31.3% at the end of June, and it's 31.1% as we sat here
September 30. But we are starting to see more borrowing demand and pickup in the middle market space as
opposed to the corporate banking.

And then in terms of pricing, while NIM came in as expected in line with our July guide, we do have the headwind
in the C&I yield portfolio because it is very competitive out there. I think for the most part, banks are competing on
price and non-banks are competing on structure. So, for us the price headwind comes in just a little bit tighter
spreads but also some of the reduction in the LIBOR floor. So, you lose some of that excess earnings in this
environment, but you can perhaps recapture the yield benefit as the Fed starts to move on the front end of the
curve hopefully in the next year to 18 months. So, as expected, but certainly a headwind when it comes to pricing.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Good morning.

Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Good morning, Peter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
You guys have done a phenomenal job on the securities yield with the rate locks on the cash flows and the
bullets. I'm wondering is this type of securities yield sustainable into next year with the rate locks continuing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I would say, Peter, we're inoculated from the rate environment, but we're not immune to it. So, as you saw
in the numbers this quarter and as we look out even next quarter, it is a steady grind down as we reinvest the
cash flows. So, that's – hurts the yield a bit, 10, 15 basis points or so.
If you look out on the bullets themselves, they're at a 2.65% yield. With cash flows, I think we're projecting about
$7 billion of cash flows in that portfolio over the next five years. So, there will be a step-down should rates stay
where they are today. Reinvestment yields right now, I think, are in the 1.70% to 1.80% range. So, barring a curve
steepener, it will be a slow, but definitely downward trend on the portfolio yield.
The good news for us is we're very well positioned and it is pretty insulated from the environment relative to how
the peers have positioned their portfolio.

Peter J. Winter Q

Sure. Thanks for the question. The one update we have on expense savings in our program for 2022 is that we
are targeting $125 million in savings for 2022, and that's a combination of the Lean, process automation,
intelligent operations, the branch closures. We have 42 branches closing in the first quarter of 2022 and then
some smaller vendor savings bundled together. So, we've tightened the range on that bundle savings from $100
million to $150 million to $125 million.
And then obviously, we're not getting into expense guide for 2022 because we'll continue to evaluate how much of
those savings will be reinvested into sales force expansion on Commercial as well as the Wealth and Asset
Management. But we feel good about the progress we're making on the LPA program. In fact, if you look in the
press release buried, I think, at the bottom of page 14 is an FTE count, and we're down a couple hundred FTE
even with adding about a hundred from the Provide acquisition. And that's starting to show the benefit of that LPA
savings.
So, we've made progress. We've had some success. There's about $6 million of savings in our fourth quarter
forecast tied into that program, but then the $125 million for next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
And the head count there doesn't even reflect the benefit from the offshore, right. The automation savings on
offshore processes that were completed by JV partners where we're, I think, north of 20% at this point of the
processes that were offshore now fully automated.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
I think from the other part of your question on inflation, in terms of wage inflation and other things, we've been
able to manage through the environment from an employee and cost structure. And still deliver fairly stable
expenses this quarter.
We continue to see opportunity to do the same while there is the wage inflation and other pressure. We do have
those other opportunities ahead of us. And so, perhaps, some of the $125 million would be absorbed by some
inflationary pressure. But ultimately, a moderate amount of inflation would ultimately be very positive for the bank
in terms of PPNR and interest income capabilities.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Greg, when you look at your CET1 ratio, you targeted to bring it down to 9.5% by June of next year. It looks like if
I recall correctly, your required number is 7% by the Feds. What would it take for you guys to bring it down from
9.5% to something lower? Or is it now the 9.5% is set in stone and you're just not going to budge off on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Well, there's nothing set in stone, Gerard. But at the end of the day, we think that's the prudent place to be. It's
multifaceted as we think about that level. And we obviously believe we can run the bank at a much lower level but
also we watch what the market is doing. The environment we're operating in, what our peers are doing. We just
think that's a prudent target point to shoot for at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, maybe, Richard, we could talk about credit quality. Obviously, your numbers, similar to
some of your peers, are quite strong, particularly in the net charge-off area. And I suspect that this is unusually
good and it's not sustainable just due to normal seasoning of portfolios. How long do you think you guys could see
net charge-offs stay at this extremely low level? And when do you think that they start creeping up to a more
normal level? I know normal is hard to define, but when do they start to creep up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Gerard, thanks for the question. Clearly, we're pleased with the 8 basis points this quarter. And like you
said, we don't think that's going to repeat. But given the economic outlook, we do expect charge-offs to be better
than our through-the-cycle average, and probably certainly into 2022 and into 2023 for a couple of reasons. One,
it's going to be simply the amount of liquidity that's out there; two, inflation, collateral values continue to be strong.
And when we run our mid-cycle stress test, we're seeing 25 to 35 basis points as a charge-off range for the bank
through 2022 and 2023.
Now, as I said, it's a little bit lower than what we think the long-term average is. If you recall, we think through-the-
cycle average is somewhere between 35 and 45 basis points. But given our approach, given the way we manage
the balance sheet, the way we think about client selection and underwriting, we think it's a grind through 2022 and
2023 back to something that feels a little bit more normal.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Hi, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jamie, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the portfolio
structure. So, when you talk about the $7 billion that's kind of going to run-off over the next several years, how
high are you on that part of the book? And when you're reinvesting the cash flows to keep the book flat, are you
also buying back some new type of bullet structures? Or are you just more investing in kind of plain vanilla today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
So, we've been buying a little bit of everything when we're reinvesting. The portfolio of cash flows have been
running about $1.5 billion a quarter, second quarter, third quarter. So, depending on the day, we've added some
Level 1s, we've added some Level 2s. But in total, the mix hasn't really changed a whole lot.
And then in terms of the bullets, over the next couple years, it's a very small number in terms of total cash flow,
maybe couple hundred million. And then over years three, four, five, then you start to have cash flow portfolio. But
right now, the total book, bullets as well as the cash flowing securities, we're in a 2.75% yield, give or take. And
then for the fourth quarter, yield should be a little bit better than that with a little bit of seasonal mutual fund
dividends in the NQDC plus a little bit of prepayment penalties that have occurred thus far in October.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Okay. Got it. Thank you. And just a follow-up. You guys have been really taking down the long-term debt footprint
which is still, even at its size, the majority of your interest-bearing liability costs. Just wonder where is the level
that you need to keep it at? And what's the trade-off versus the deposit base, the mix of deposits and how much
more could you potentially return – reduce that footprint? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yes. We're probably at the low point in terms of the long-term debt outstanding. We had a maturity in September,
$850 million that we'll perhaps look to replenish in the next quarter or two. But I think we're at a good spot and
we're well positioned. We've been able to utilize the excess liquidity and take advantage of the environment to
deliver some savings from a cost standpoint, both from long-term debt as well as running off some of the CD book
that certainly behaves more like wholesale funding than the core deposit book. So, I think we're in a good spot
and we'll probably reach the end of the line on the long-term debt but probably have a little bit more room on the
CD book to run it down a little bit more.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Greg, you mentioned some key talent hires that should help drive loan production into 2022. Can you provide a
little bit of color on the areas where you're hiring, particularly within the lending areas? And if that hiring is
continuing? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Absolutely. Thanks for the question. Obviously, the Southeast markets where we've been adding to our
relationship management bankers in that market with a lot of success there. So, we're really pleased with the
production we're seeing in that market. So, we'll continue to add in that market. There's great opportunities and
we run a good franchise down there, and that's obviously a focal point for our expansion.
In addition to that, I would say Texas, the West Coast, California, the talent we've been able to acquire in those
markets, the bankers that we've brought on, significant increases of bankers in those markets over the last two,
three years, and we're seeing great progress from a production perspective, outstanding perspective, so, like –
those are the strategies. We watch them very carefully. We invest where we see opportunities and those areas
continue to be great opportunities for us. More to come. So, let me just turn over to Tim to see if he has any color
he wants to add to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yes. I think a couple other. I think Greg hit the geographic points. We also are in the process of building out a
mortgage warehouse vertical. That's a good business for us. It's a business we've been in historically, but it hasn't
been a point of focus, and we saw an opportunity there with some talent to go out and take some market share.
So, I think that's an area we continue to add to the renewables team and are focused on how we expand what is
already, I think, a pretty strong capability there and a good track record.
And then we were pleased to be able to land some really important talent into Provide post the Provide acquisition
and have now formally launched the vet vertical there for veterinarians, which I think is going to be a really good
source of growth to complement the strength we already have in medical, dental in that business line.

Got it. All right. Thank you. And then secondly, if you could just update us where you stand on core system
upgrade? Can you maybe remind us of the timing of the project and the cost that you see tied to it? And then
separately, do you see any risk to the cost that you had budgeted for the upgrade given the wage inflation
dynamics? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
First off, our tech budget is – let me take that first is about $700 million. That has been growing about 10% per
year for the last five years. When you think about our core platforms, and we talked about the modernization
effort, that has been going on for a couple years. You saw that with our mortgage loan origination system, the
resiliency platforms we put in place, the data architecture strategy we rolled out. Next coming up is obviously FIS,
core deposits and we're in the midst right now turning on nCino. That's going extremely well and something we're
very pleased with. So, this is an ongoing effort. If you ask me if it was a baseball analogy, we're probably in mid-
innings here. But it's a long game, and we'll continue to invest prudently.
In addition to that, when you think about our tech spend, a lot of the tech spend is focused on being able to take
cost out. So, lean process automation has been a great focus of our business and an area where we've made a
lot of progress in. So, we'll continue to invest for those opportunities. We'll continue to stay focused on core
platform replacement. Our partnership with FIS, the fact that we're the largest processing customer.
If you think about how we think about that business and the integration, what we've done with the core platforms,
we'll be able to manage costs very efficiently and effectively through that exercise. So, we're very comfortable
with what we think the new operating environment will look like from a cost perspective. But if you think about our
tech spend, how we think about our business, it's really 50% of keeping the business running, so to speak, 35% of
advancing the business and then 15% protecting the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yes, John. It's Tim. One just small point to add to that, and it came up earlier. There was a question about
inflation and wages. Jamie said earlier, we were immune, but not inoculated on a different point – I'm sorry,
inoculated, but not immune on a different point.
I think here again, we raised our minimum wage to $18 an hour in 2019. I think we were the first of the regional
banks, certainly of our peer group to have made that move. And the byproduct of that is we are watching as I'm
sure you are, the announcements coming out of many of our peers that they're raising their minimum wage, but
they're getting to $18 an hour in nearly all cases, which is where Fifth Third is already at. The by-product of that is
a lot of that near-term impact is kind of in our run rate.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on your net charge-off rate commentary. As you think about the
normalization of your NCO rates off these low levels to the 25, 35 basis points in 2022-2023 that you mentioned,
is the level of your reserve rate currently high enough such that the trajectory is also likely to be flat to down even
as NCO rates normalize higher? Any color that you can give on that dynamic would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I think it's a little tough to take a life of loan expected loss rate of the ACL and compare it to short-term
forecast because the loan maturity is certainly – are a swing factor in that. So, obviously, we're comfortable with
our ACL at 200 basis points. It's 204 basis points excluding PPP. So, yeah, I'm comfortable that the ACL is
adequate to cover the expected losses over the life of the loans.
And then, when Richard was talking about those periodic charge-off levels for a point in time and with a fairly
shorter duration portfolio throwing off some of those losses in the consumer side, card and auto, I think we're at a
good spot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. Very helpful. Thank you. And then following up on the utilization commentary, to the extent that supply
chain problems were to extend further into next year, how much do you think that weighs on – just given the
makeup of your client base, how much would that sort of weigh on the normalization of utilization rates versus the
potential for those utilization rates to continue to improve even if those supply chain problems were to extend a bit
longer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I think we're seeing stable line utilization because of those supply chain constraints. So, hopefully, the
worst-case scenario would be stable. As we talked about in our guide, we expect a little bit of an uptick, both from
the seasonal and year-end positioning with our customers of about 0.5%. So, we've reduced our outlook on
utilization because of the supply chain and labor constraints.
From a next year perspective, hopefully, they get resolved and we'll start to see inventory builds and that should
provide a little bit of a tailwind to our loan growth expectations.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I was wondering if you could dig a little bit more into some of the loan yield pressure that you were talking about
earlier? And if you kind of just hold rates constant, when does that eventually flatten out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Matt, for our quarter, if you look in the tables and you look at the gross yield decline 2Q to 3Q, it's really
driven by three factors. One, 2Q had elevated prepayment loan fees that get recorded in the NII. So, 2Q was
high. So, that was a portion. You have regular repricing front book, back book phenomenon, and that's – I would
characterize it as 3 basis points or so of NIM from that and I expect that should continue into the fourth quarter.
And then the other phenomenon on the LIBOR floor is more a consequence of getting through renewal season
and some of the other things happening out of the second quarter. So, that should dissipate, but that was call it, a
third to half of that yield compression you see in the tables in the earnings release.
So, as we look ahead, I would expect a couple bps, 2 to 3 bps headwind from C&I loan yield compression for all
of those factors into the fourth quarter. And that's why we're guiding the reported NIM down as well for the fourth
quarter, similar to what we saw in the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then, I guess beyond 4Q, I mean, is there still a fair amount of repricing between the back book and the front
book and all that or...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
It's...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
...are you getting close to – sorry, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
No, thanks for the question. I think from a front book, back book perspective, the tailwind of the curve steepening
we've seen in the third quarter, and should that continue, we'll hit that intersection. But until we get a little more lift,
you do have the repricing effect continuing where new loans are coming on at lower yields than the runoff and
paydowns in the back book.

I think on top of that, we have done a nice job managing NII and the balance sheet through this environment. And
we certainly have dry powder whether it's through the asset sensitivity or the $33 billion of excess cash that we
could choose to deploy to mitigate those effects, if need be.
But for now, we still think patience is still the way to go. And, therefore, if there's a little bit of NIM compression
along the way, that's fine. Our focus is more on the long-term and delivering the best performance we can over
the next five years.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Well, you mentioned positive operating leverage in 2021, even while you spent 10% more on tech and that you're
in kind of the fourth or fifth inning of your tech transformation. So, I guess the question is do you intend to
continue to spend around 10% more on tech each year? And how is that changing, especially as you move off-
premise as much as you are, is there going to be a period where you have to run somewhat parallel systems and
then you'll get the benefit in a few years out? And more generally, how do you think about the number of tech
partners that you have? And if you can quantify the number, I'll take that, too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Hey, Mike. This is Greg. Listen, I think 10% is probably the right number for us, that's not cast in stone. As
you mentioned, operating leverage – positive operating leverage, that's something we're very focused on we'll
deliver in 2021. As we go into our planning process for 2022, our focus is on positive operating leverage.
So, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of that – some of that tech spend is going right to process efficiencies. We were
able to take out the 200-plus additional people and so forth, branch closures, some things that we're working on
right now on the other expense side of the house supports that positive operating leverage. And we continue to
grow fees at a really robust rate, close to 10% CAGR over the last couple of years.
So, net-net, positive operating leverage, something we're very focused on and believe we can continue to deliver
on. In addition to that, the tech spend will roughly run around 10-plus-percent.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
When you think about the core platform modernization, we talked about the fourth or fifth inning, I think of it more
as a cricket test match. It has been going on. It's going to continue to go on for quite some time. We're going to
have to deal with that. But at the end of the day, I think as we put these new platforms in, we're able to do it in a
very systematic way with respect to how we turn these platforms on. So, it's not the big bang approach. We're
able to turn it on by geography, by product line. So, we're very insulated from having to do a big bang impact.
With that said, you have some dual system platforms that are going to run simultaneously till we get all markets,
all products converted over in the case of some of our major implementations coming up like our core deposit
platform. So, that's going to take a little bit of time.
At the end of the day, we should be a lot more efficient. We should be able to bring more enhancements at a
different cadence forward to our business. We should be able to continue to take out costs through our lean
process automation and our investments in AI technology.
So, net-net, tech is going to be a source of spend for us in that range that I mentioned before as we go forward
but then I think we're getting paid very well for it. Our objective is to go head-to-head with the fintech players, the
large bank competitors that we have to deal with and be very successful. And we've been able to do that and
demonstrate that.
When you think about the fintech players that are out there, we've got the same capabilities. We've got our
products like Momentum, but we also got 53,000 free ATMs, 1,100 banking centers and 10,000 service personnel
that they don't have, and we got the core relationships. So, net-net, we'll continue to stay focused, but that's kind
of the range we're going to operate in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
That's helpful. Just one more follow-up. Just one simple thought. I mean there's a debate of how much banks
should keep on-premise versus off-premise. Clearly, you're going more in the off-premise direction, and it seems
like you're accelerating that. What was the tipping point? What was the biggest factor to say, you know what we
want to have more of the open architecture, the off-premise, even though some other banks are saying we want
to keep a lot of on-premise?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
I think we intend to transition – we said 90% on-premise and you think about that, over the next five years as we
look at this that's going to shift. As we mentioned before, so, 90% on-premise is going to shift to roughly 90% off-
premise. And 70% of that will be hosted in a private cloud. When you think about platforms like FIS, nCino that's
all going to be private clouds, and the public cloud, AWS, about 20%. So, you think about the shift, 90% will be an
off-premise model, and roughly 70% private, 20% public.

as we look at our earnings models over the next couple years and redeploy a lot of the excess liquidity. Just
wondering, some of your peers has mentioned maybe 30% earning assets would be the limit of securities
regardless of rate. So, just wondering if you thought about a constraint on the securities book? And then also
embedded in the securities book, the CMBS portfolio has kind of crept up. Now it's just under 60% of the available
for sale. Didn't know if there – it's all agency or predominantly agency with that there's a concentration limit that
you have on that portfolio as well. Thank you.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yes. Thanks for the question, David. The short answer is that when we look at the excess liquidity, call it, $30
billion, we expect a third of it to go into the securities portfolio, a third of it into loans, a third of it, we think, while
deposits in the banking system may not decline, we do expect those deposits to find a more productive home,
perhaps money market funds or other investment vehicles. So, for us, we're running at 18% or so in the securities
book as a percent of total assets.
So, if we take, call it, $10 billion of the excess liquidity and put it into the book, we're at 23%, 24%. That's where
I'd like to operate at somewhere 23% to 25% of total assets, but it's not a capacity constraint. It's more, I think,
given the environment, that's a more productive place to be.
In terms of the CMBS, I think the heart of your question is asked what is at the what is the non-agency CMBS
portion of the portfolio, and that's $3.8 billion or so. And again, for us, it's super senior tranches. We feel very
good about the credit enhancement, 30-plus-percent there. So, not a large credit risk position to have, whereas
the rest of the CMBS book would be agency guaranteed.
