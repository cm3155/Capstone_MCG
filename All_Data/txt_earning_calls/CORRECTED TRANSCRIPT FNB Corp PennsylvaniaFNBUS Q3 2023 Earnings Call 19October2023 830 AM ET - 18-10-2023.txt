Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Thank you and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Vince Calabrese, our Chief
Financial Officer, and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer. FNB reported third quarter net income available to
common shareholders of $143 million or $0.40 per diluted common share. This quarter's performance represents
EPS growth of 3% linked quarter. Our results reflect the execution of FNB's long-term strategies geared towards
risk management, client primacy, generating organic growth and diversifying fee-based income.
Our third quarter efficiency ratio equaled 51.7% and is expected to remain in the upper quartile on a pure relative
basis. In addition, operating leverage on a year-to-date basis is 8%. Tangible book value per share has increased
12.5% year-over-year to $9.02, despite the impact of higher interest rates and return on tangible common equity
was again at a solid level of 18.2%. As we have previously mentioned, FNB is well positioned to steadily increase
market share in this volatile environment given the strength of our capital and liquidity position and adherence to
our consistent and conservative underwriting guidelines.
Total deposits ended the third quarter at $34.6 billion, a 2.3% increase from the second quarter, while maintaining
a relatively stable mix of non-interest-bearing deposits of 31%. Our third quarter linked deposit growth once again
outpaced the Federal Reserve H8 deposit beta, continuing a trend of quarterly outperformance versus the
industry and demonstrating the strength of our granular deposit base and diversified geographic footprint as well
as our goal to be the primary bank for our clients.
In fact, FDIC deposit market share data released in September revealed that FNB ranks in the top five in nearly
50% of the MSAs we operate in and in the top three in nearly 30%. Despite the acceleration of deposit
competition throughout the banking industry, FNB spot deposits have decreased less than 0.5% since year end
2022, demonstrating our trusted position as our customer's primary operating bank. Our deposit growth this
quarter was effectively funded dollar-for-dollar by our 2.5% linked quarter growth in loans, which also meaningfully
outperformed H8 data.
Commercial loan growth of 2.4% benefited from the highest level quarterly production year-to-date, which was
spread across the entire footprint. Since year end 2022, we have achieved 6.3% spot loan growth while building
our CET1 ratio to 10.2%. Tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio also continues to build, totaling 7.54%
this quarter, even against the backdrop of higher rates.
Additionally, our solid liquidity position and better than peer funding cost provides balance sheet optionality and
the ability to support our clients capital needs. The loan to deposit ratio remains at a comfortable level of 92.9%.
We also continue to invest in capabilities to gain market share and further outpace our competitors, particularly in
the digital offerings we deliver for retail and business customers. Our award winning eStore offers unique platform
driving a better customer experience and product penetration. Our most recent implementation, the eStore
Common application, creates a single universal account application for the majority of our consumer loan
products and services, enabling customers to apply for multiple products simultaneously in a very streamlined
manner. In a few months, we will add our consumer deposit products to the Common application, which will
facilitate faster customer onboarding across multiple products. It should meaningfully accelerate the adoption of
the Common application.
We will capitalize on our competitive advantage with our superior digital offering and the strength of our balance
sheet to acquire and grow customer relationships across our seven state footprint. During the quarter, we fully
charged off the commercial/industrial loan we mentioned in our second quarter earnings call. Gary will provide
more information during his presentation. Absent that isolated charge-off, total net charge-offs would have been a
modest 7 basis points and total delinquency stood at 63 basis points.

Our growth strategies are balanced by a diligent focus on risk management. We closely monitor macroeconomic
and market specific trends to manage risk as part of our core credit philosophy, which has served us well in softer
economic times. We remain steadfast in our approach to consistent underwriting and managing credit risk to
maintain a balanced, well-positioned portfolio throughout economic cycles, enabling us to serve our customers
through business cycles in ways our competitors cannot.
I will now turn the call over to Gary to provide additional information on our credit performance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. We ended the quarter and year-to-date period with our asset
quality metrics remaining at good levels. Total delinquency decreased 12 basis points in the quarter to end that 63
bps, and NPLs and OREO decreased 10 basis points to end at a solid 36 bps. Criticized loans were down 18
basis points with net charge-offs for the quarter and year-to-date of 47 and 26 basis points respectively. Excluding
the isolated credit that Vince noted, net charge-offs for the quarter and year-to-date period were 7 and 12 basis
points respectively. I'll conclude my remarks with an update on our credit risk management strategies and CRE
portfolio.
As previously disclosed in the second quarter earnings call, we placed a single $31.9 million C&I loan on non-
accrual. Based on alleged fraud and upon later findings uncovered during our ongoing investigation, including
subsequent bankruptcy filings by our borrower and its primary supplier, the outstanding balance was charged off.
We will continue to monitor the bankruptcy process closely and aggressively pursue all opportunities to recover a
portion of the charge-off.
Total provision expense for the quarter stood at $25.6 million, providing for loan growth and the previously
mentioned charge-off in excess of the $13 million specific reserve that we allocated to it at the prior quarter end.
Our ending funded reserve decreased $12.1 million in the quarter and stands at $401 million or a solid 1.25% of
loans, reflecting our strong position relative to our peers. When including acquired unamortized loan discounts,
our reserve stands at 1.39% and our NPL coverage position remains strong at 394% inclusive of the unamortized
loan discounts.
We remain committed to consistent underwriting and credit risk management to maintain a balanced, well-
positioned portfolio throughout economic cycles and continue to perform full stress test of the loan portfolio on a
quarterly basis. We were pleased with the outcome of the result of the recent exercise, which confirms that our
diversified loan portfolio enables us to withstand various economic downturns scenarios. Regarding the non-
owner occupied CRE portfolio, delinquency and NPLs remained very low at 31 and 20 basis points respectively,
confirming that our consistent underwriting and strong sponsorship demonstrates the ability to perform in a rising
rate environment.
In closing, asset quality metrics ended the quarter at good levels, and we continue to generate diversified loan
growth in attractive markets. We closely monitor macroeconomic trends and the individual markets in our footprint
and we'll continue to manage risk aggressively as part of our core credit philosophy, which has served us well
throughout various economic cycles.
I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr.
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Today, I will focus on the third quarter's financial results and offer guidance
updates for the fourth quarter. Third quarter net income available to common shareholders totaled $143.3 million
or $0.40 per share, bringing year-to-date earnings per share to $1.18. The results include contributions from our
commercial leasing team who originate renewable energy financing transactions as part of their business model.
And this quarter, they closed a large solar deal with a related investment tax credit.
Loans and leases ended the quarter at $32 billion, growing $796 million or 2.5% linked quarter, driven by the
success of our strategy to grow high quality loans across our diverse footprint. Commercial loan growth of $470
million or 2.4% was across our seven state geography, with notable contributions in the Pittsburgh, Mid-Atlantic
and North Carolina markets.
Consumer loans ended the third quarter at $12 billion, a linked quarter increase of $326 million or 2.8% led by
growth in residential mortgages. Investment portfolio remained flat at $7.1 billion, with a fairly even split between
AFS and HTM. The duration of our securities portfolio at September 30 is 4.4 years similar to last quarter.
Total deposits ended September at $34.6 billion with a healthy increase of $790 million linked quarter or 2.3%,
reflecting organic deposit growth and seasonal municipal deposit inflows. Our deposit gathering capabilities have
continued to outperform the industry, as illustrated by the Federal Reserve H8 deposit data, where our deposit
growth was nearly 220 basis points higher for the quarter and 320 basis points higher since year end 2022.
The deposit mix shift slowed modestly this quarter as customers moved into time deposits and interest-bearing
demand deposits, which grew $458 million and $712 million respectively, more than offsetting the decrease in
non-interest-bearing deposits of $210 million. As time deposits have grown, we have intentionally kept the
portfolio short with a weighted average maturity of 11 months. So then, when rates do fall, we will have the ability
to reprice these balances downwards.
As of September 30, non-interest-bearing deposits comprised 31% of total deposits, compared to 32% at June 30
and 34% at year end. Given our granular stable deposit base, we believe we will continue to outperform the
industry with a favorable mix of non-interest-bearing deposits to total deposits, even in a higher for longer interest
rate environment.
The loans to deposit ratio remained at a comfortable level of 92.9%, flat with June 30. Revenue totaled $408
million driven by net interest income of $327 million and growth in non-interest income reflecting our diversified
fee income strategy. The third quarter's net interest margin was 3.26%, a decline of 11 basis points, moderating
from the 19 basis point decline last quarter. The yield on earning assets increased 17 basis points to 5.11%,
reflecting higher yields on loans and investment securities.
Total cost of funds increased 29 basis points to 1.93%, as the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 39 basis
points to 2.36% and was partially offset by the contribution from non-interest-bearing deposits. We continue to
actively manage our total deposit cost and ended the quarter at 1.75%, bringing the cumulative deposit beta to
31%. We are projecting cumulative beta to end 2023 in the mid-30s.
Turning to non-interest income and expense. Non-interest income totaled $81.6 million, a 2% increase from the
second quarter as capital markets income increased $1.2 million, led by international banking with solid
contributions from swap fees, syndications and debt capital markets income. Mortgage banking operations

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
income decreased $1 million due to negative fair value marks given the sharp increase in mortgage rates during
the third quarter that more than offset a 46% increase in total salable mortgage production versus last quarter.
Non-interest expense totaled $218 million, an increase of $6.2 million or 3% from last quarter. Net occupancy and
equipment expense increased $3.5 million, largely due to the impact of technology investments and the
inflationary macroeconomic environment. Marketing expenses increased $1.5 million due to the timing of digital
marketing campaigns, which helped drive deposit growth and acquire additional households. The efficiency ratio
equaled a solid 51.7%, up slightly from 50% last quarter. For the first nine months of 2023, the efficiency ratio
totaled 50.8%, compared to 54.7% for the same timeframe in 2022.
While supporting the strong loan growth, our capital ratios remained robust through the quarter. Our TCE finished
the quarter at 7.54%, and when adjusted for held to maturity investment marks, would equal 6.7%. Our CET1
ratio at 10.2% is in line with peer median and we remain well-capitalized even when including the fair value marks
in our AFS and HTM portfolios.
Tangible book value per common share was $9.02 at September 30, an increase of $0.23 per share from June
30, largely from the higher level of retained earnings more than offsetting the increased impact of AOCI, which
reduced the current quarter end tangible book value per common share by $1.06. On a year-over-year basis,
tangible book value per common share increased a full dollar or 12.5%, demonstrating our commitment to internal
capital generation.
Let's now look at the fourth quarter financial objectives, starting with the balance sheet. On a full year spot basis,
we increased our previous guide for loans to grow mid-to-high single digits year-over-year as we take this time to
invest in our capabilities to gain market share across our diverse geographic footprint.
Total projected deposit balances are revised upward to end 2023, relatively flat to year end 2022 spot balances.
The fourth quarter net interest income is expected to be between $315 million and $325 million assuming no
additional interest rate hikes for the rest of the year. Fourth quarter non-interest income is expected to be around
$80 million, which is similar to our guidance levels for the first three quarters of the year as we continue to benefit
from our strategy of diversified fee-based businesses.
Fourth quarter guidance for non-interest expense is expected to be between $215 million and $220 million, driven
by increased investment spend and the impact of the inflationary macroeconomic environment. Full year provision
guidance is revised to a tighter band of $70 million to $80 million and will be dependent on net loan growth and
charge-off activity in the fourth quarter.
Lastly, the full year effective tax rate should be between 17.5% and 18%, and the fourth quarter effective tax rate
is expected to be between 17.8% and 18.2%, reflecting benefits of investment tax credits generated through the
financing transactions of our commercial leasing business in the quarter.
With that, I will turn the call back to Vince.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes
from Daniel Tamayo from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, guys. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about updated thoughts on when you think the margin
might bottom and if you had any more details on what the month of September look like from a margin
perspective and yields [ph] potentially (00:21:37).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Good morning, Danny. I guess couple of comments on that. I think given everything industry's withstood
this year, clearly the peak was in the first quarter. If you look at our net interest income for the third quarter, we
only declined $2.6 million in a NIM compression, as I commented on – moderated to 11 basis points after
decreasing 19 basis points last quarter. The monthly decline in NIM has been averaging around 3, 4 basis points
a month since May. So it's been – I mean, it's been coming down, but pretty steady within that range. Our outlook
for the fourth quarter of the $315 million to $325 million doesn't have any rate increases as I mentioned, with the
decline in margin kind of similar to what we saw in the third quarter is kind of what's baked into our guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate it. And then kind of moving over to loan growth, I'm just curious how you're
thinking about loan growth potentially next year if the economy does slow. It's sustained at a pretty strong growth
level here throughout the 2023, in particular Physicians First and the residential mortgage book. But just curious
on kind of higher level thoughts about the ability to sustain that kind of loan growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I think – first of all, I think that we're in a really strong position relative to many competitors, particularly
made smaller banks who are struggling with capital and liquidity issues. So it puts us in a position where FNB can
become – we go on the offense basically, and we're able to go after more opportunities with confidence. We can
support our clients' capital needs as we move through 2024. We didn't give guidance for 2024, so I can't really
7

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
speak to specific numbers. But my expectation moving into next year is it's going to be choppy for everybody from
a loan demand perspective. I think for us to be successful, we're going to have to stay very focused on
maximizing or growing market share in the markets that we've moved into where there still continues to be good
solid growth in those markets from a GDP perspective. I think that's one thing that will help us.
Secondarily, I think given the size, span of the company today versus where we were four years ago. We have
multiple markets to pursue opportunities in. So I think going into 2024, depending on how the economy shakes
out, it will be more challenging to find credit worthy borrowers that we would want to bank. Right? In that
environment, I think it's going to be more competitive. So I think having the right people spread across those
areas would be a benefit to us versus somebody that's heavily concentrated in, say, Pennsylvania or Ohio. So I
think all of that will play in our favor.
I think we've also invested pretty heavily in certain platforms that will continue to drive fee income for us. So in
addition to loan growth, we did perform pretty well from a fee income perspective given the pressures that we
were facing. But we've invested in our digital platform, which should help us in small business and gathering
deposits as we move into this fall and the common app is fully built out.
We've invested pretty heavily in treasury management systems. Our payment processing capabilities and lockbox
capability that we still offer clients has been upgraded in the last year or so. Capital markets, we've built out our
ability to participate in our the [ph] bond offering for (00:25:41) debt capital markets platform, and that continues to
perform well for us and enables us to move up market and participate in lower risk transactions and still meet the
return thresholds that we have internally.
So all of that will play well for us as we move into next year. So those are the reasons why I feel more confident
about our performance this quarter and then into next quarter. But I will caution you, I think the macroeconomic
environment will play a role. Demand has to be there as well. So [ph] the capital investment has to be occurring
(00:26:21), anyway on the commercial side.

Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start on a comment you made, Vince,
about making investments on the OpEx side and trying to take advantage of [indiscernible] (00:27:01). I was
wondering if you guys are willing to kind of go layer deeper on that. I mean, I think it's evident and obvious from
the financials that you guys are in a strong position here. So what type of investments are you looking at? What
do you think could make the biggest difference as you look to the next 12 months here and obviously still have
some growth opportunities in front of you and a lot of peers that probably have some opportunities but don't have
the balance sheets to really kind of fully take advantage of them?

I'm sorry you broke up a little bit. You're speaking specifically to digital? Is that your question?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I imagine most of the things you're looking at are digital. But just more broadly, any like initiatives or
kind of areas of investment that you guys are particularly focused on that you think could be pretty fruitful over the
next 12 months in terms of kind of continuing growth and being able to take share while the industry is in a
weaker position?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, well, first of all, I think it's a great question and we've talked about this internally. There are two paths to go
down as we move into next year. I mean let's face it, the banking industry in general is facing margin
compression. Some banks are struggling to grow revenue. It's highly competitive from a depository perspective.
So I certainly understand why there's a lot of caution moving into next year. But I think given our position, we have
strong capital. We're in a strong capital position. We have tremendous liquidity. We have made investments in de
novo expansion in the retail space which are coming online. Expense comes along with that. So we've already
started to invest in those projects and you'll see depreciation expense coming online with those. But we're at the
point now where they should start to generate revenue or contribute to our effort, right, because we launched a
number of them at the beginning of this year, late last year. So we should be seeing some good success there.
And those are principally in higher growth markets that are not feeling as much pain as some of the other more
legacy markets from a growth perspective. So we're very optimistic about the performance there.
We're also optimistic about our build-out of the Common app that I spoke about. You can purchase multiple loan
products on our platform today. By the end of this quarter, we'll be able to buy multiple loan products and multiple
depository products with one application. And the training's going on. And we've been doing training on our
systems and on our capabilities for some time. I think you're going to start to see that pay off. We also changed
our model. In the branches several years ago in the consumer bank, we started rolling out relationship bankers
instead of having tellers and platform people. So more highly trained bankers in the branches. We're finally
closing out the last region in terms of converting those folks over to this higher profile banking position, which
should help with cross-sell and driving product sales in the branches beyond just doing transactions.
And then we have bankers. Basically, there are a number of bankers that are pulling back in other institutions. So
I think we'll have opportunities to go after business that presents itself that – we've been – for companies that
we've been calling on for a long time in the commercial space. We've made investments in – so to be more
specific, we've made investments in treasury management, which I think will assist us in becoming primary client
for [indiscernible] (00:30:57) market and larger company. We made investments in the digital platforms to help us
go after more share of wallet more quickly, right, with clients by presenting more efficient platforms to onboard
clients. We invested pretty heavily in our institutional capabilities from a capital market perspective [indiscernible]
(00:31:17) the client. So I think really we have a number of areas that we work on. And I think that we're definitely
going to experience better than peer results because of it. So that's my commentary.
We also, by the way, built out our small business lending platform. We continue to focus on that. Our plan is to
integrate merchant and treasury management services into a bundled program similar to the Common app. So
that is going to be worked on in the first quarter of next year. We have about 90,000 clients that are either
9

(FNB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
depository or loan clients in the small business segment. So there's quite a bit – I think we have about 3% to 5%
penetration with merchant in that space. So there's quite a bit of opportunity there from a fee income perspective.
We've been focusing on that moving into next year. So those are some of the strategic investments that we've
made. And I do believe that at this time, it makes sense for this company to continue to pursue those investments
and drive revenue growth during 2024. It might be more difficult for others to do that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. No, that makes a lot of sense. So that's great flavor. Thank you for walking through all that. And just lastly
for me and then I'll step back and let someone else jump in. Just curious, more of a high-level question and a
near-term question, but as you think about the franchise, besides the growth projections, I imagine you guys have
constant conversations with the board and the executive team around what the right level of capitalization is. And
obviously, at the higher end of the spectrum, on the asset side, there's a lot of conversations about capital. I'm
just curious what – any updated thoughts around what you think kind of the right capital level for FNB is like over
the next few years here? I mean, do you think it's a higher number than maybe what it was over the last 24
months? I mean, obviously, you don't have to get there right now. But just kind of curious what the conversation is
internally around capital, just given everything that's happened. And as you think about taking share and
continuing to grow the balance sheet moving forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, we cover capital and liquidity position in the company in every board meeting that we have. So we have
[indiscernible] (00:33:42) go over various elements of our financial performance. We discuss the balance sheet in
detail and strategies around maximizing returns. That happens in every board meeting. And then we talk about
what the investors expect and what the Street expects and how we're performing relative to those expectations.
I think capital is a topic that we've had on the table for a long time. I think given the AOCI impairment that you've
seen impact other capital position, we were viewed as having less capital, because we actually operate with a
lower risk profile within the commercial loan categories that we participate in in the consumer [indiscernible]
(00:34:31) we're very conservative.
But if you look at where we are today with CET1 at 10%, our TCE ratio is 7.5% and growing, we feel pretty
comfortable with where we are from a capital perspective. I understand that $100 billion and greater, we're going
to see greater expectations from regulators for capital. But I think given where we are today, we're in one of the
better positions we've been in years. We have a very solid portfolio. We've spent a lot of time and energy. Gary's
done a tremendous job de-risking that portfolio with the sale of Regency, the sale of hospitality, the sales with
adverse credits and – we basically have done a lot. We've moved over $1 billion off the balance sheet before the
pandemic even occurred.
So I think we're in a great position from a capital perspective. We feel comfortable where we are today and we
address it in every board meeting. And if you look at our returns on tangible common equity, we're upper quartile.
So even with higher capital ratios, we're still an 18% [indiscernible] (00:35:43). So pretty good solid performance
and profitability.

One more thing on capital, by the way. We've dividended out over $1.5 billion or – through share repurchases or
dividends, over a $1.5 billion in capital deployment to shareholders as well. So I think when you think about the
company and capital management, that's part of the discussions that we have with the board, just to throw that in
there. So our shareholders have benefited from that distribution of capital immensely, and obviously, we have
retained that capital. We've much higher capital ratios. That part of the equation, we feel that we need to evaluate
where we are every quarter. But anyway, sorry.

Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I mean as far as [indiscernible] (00:37:26) guidance for next year in January. But I mean, I think as I mentioned,
fourth quarter kind of coming down at a similar level to third quarter. And I mean maybe first half of the year next
year. But again, we have to do our – we just started our budget process for next year. So I think there's still some
movement down. Exactly when it bottoms is a hard thing to call for sure. But somewhere in the kind of middle of
2024 would be kind of based on where things are today. But they could change by the time we finalize our budget
and put out guidance in January.
But the compression I talked about is clearly – it's moderated. If the fourth quarter comes down similar to the third
quarter, the net interest income, as I mentioned earlier, only came down $3 million. So I think the sustainability of
the net interest income is very important. Right? And driving our efficiency ratio in the low-50 as a key part of it.
So more to come in January as far as what level [ph] it actually might bottom at (00:38:27). So it's definitely
moderated, the compression as I commented on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
All right. I appreciate the color there. On deposits, the CD engine is definitely powerful. It's what customers are
looking for. Are you seeing – do you have some breakdown on what you're seeing from – is that from new

No, I was just going to say, I think it's a combination of all of the above. Right? I think your part of the strategy was
to persuade folks to bring additional dollars over. So some of the campaigns focused principally on that, the

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
money market offering, some of the CD offerings that we have. I think we've had quite a bit of success bringing in
new customers. So north of 50% of the new money that comes in is new customers. So it's better than 50%/50%,
but it's worth, let's put it that way.
But I think the principal reason why we're successful and we've been able to manage the betas and the migration
a little better really is because of the insight that we have in our customer base with the tools that we put into
place with AI and I guess data scientists and the data hub that we have. We were able to just spend a lot of time
analyzing behavior and I think that's really helped us with pricing. And we've been a little more disciplined than
others. I think if you look at our cost of funds, our margins were a little better. So it kind of shows there. But I also
believe that being the principal bank for consumers and businesses, as I said in my remarks, is critically
important. And that requires a consistent investment in technology, treasury management services, all the things
that I mentioned earlier. So they both go hand in hand.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
I appreciate that. Do you have a rough percent on – a rough average rate on the new CDs or what's your current

...in the muni book briefly?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, Vince, I don't know. I don't have those details at the tip of my fingers. Do you have that, Vince?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would say, I mean, a couple things. The rates and the promotional CDs and money market rates have
been right around 5%, little below or a little above. So we've had – as Vince said, with all the data analytics
supporting it and the tools we have in place, we've brought in close to $800 million in new money really since May
through that, and that's kind of benefited the overall balance sheet. And then the muni flows, I've always talked
about, is $300 million to $500 million is kind of the range of what comes in. And during the most recent quarters,
it's at the higher end of that and really kind of spread throughout the category. It's – as the small amount is really
in the DDA and most of it's more in the money market and sweep accounts where that money flows through. And
that peaks and troughs as you go through the year kind of builds through October, November and then the first
quarter is always the trough of that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Well, I appreciate that. And then just switching topics, switching gears for a second, what are kind of updated
thoughts on buyback? You just had so much growth this quarter. Is that the main kind of limiter there? And
obviously, that probably comes first, organic growth. But can you just kind of walk through where buyback fits in
given that CET1 is above your target?

Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Sure, I can comment on that. I mean...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Go ahead, Vince.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. [indiscernible] (00:42:41) 10.2%. So we're a little above our target. I think during the second quarter when
we were active, there were great opportunities to put some money to work there. And in the third quarter with the
growth we had, plus the timing of the special assessment, there was an expectation that might happen in the third
quarter. And just due to uncertainty, we decided not to be active during the third quarter. It's – as always, we're
committed to managing capital in a manner that's fully aligned with shareholders. So we're closely monitoring it.
We may become active in the fourth quarter, but we want to really see how the overall environment plays out. But
clearly, there's room to do that. And with the dividend payout ratio that we've all worked really hard to get down to
30%, we now have flexibility and the strong earnings generation that we have where this number will build and
we'll put it to work. Loan growth staying strong. We'll use that to support loan growth. That's always our kind of
first and best [indiscernible] (00:43:39).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. [ph] Hey, Vince (00:43:43). The other thing I wanted to mention is the tax credit transaction that we closed
this quarter. Some folks have asked, is that like a one-time event. No. We actually have a business that pursues
tax credit transactions, particularly in the energy field. So we've done a number of them over the last few years. In
the group, there's a pipeline of tax credit transactions that we pursue. So sometimes it's lumpy, because it takes
time to build out [indiscernible] (00:44:16) deal or it takes time to get certified and get that stuff up and running
because they actually have to be [ph] delivering power (00:44:23) right before you can start a process from a
financial perspective. But it is a business that we have. It's in our corporate finance area and they've done a
terrific job over the last few years.
So I would expect that to continue as well into next year, because we've developed that expertise and we're
confident that the people that we have doing that, [indiscernible] (00:44:49) and his team have done
[indiscernible] (00:44:51) very well positioned to keep pursuing opportunities. I would add that to the mix as well,
because it doesn't show up the same way from a profitability perspective, because we booked an asset that has a
very low margin rate, that ends up impacting margin and then we get a tax benefit. And then you also say, well,
what – you're just winning on a tax benefit. But that's actually part of the profitability, the extension of the credit,
just so everybody understand. So some folks have asked us about that, and I wanted to make sure we were clear
that that's something that we pursue on an ongoing basis and will be additive to next year as well.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, any rate movement, Frank, right, it's late in the quarter doesn't really do much for the fourth
quarter, so there is not much benefit that we get there. And with where rates are, I mean it's not that big of an
impact even to next year. I mean if you look at our IRR position, we've been kind of gradually moving towards
neutral. As each quarter has gone by, we're kind of naturally getting there. When you look at – when our IRR stats
will be out in the Q, I mean the plus [ph] 100 ramp to a minus 100 ramp (00:47:12) is probably 1%, 2%. So there's
actually a benefit both ways, because you have the rates on loans. Investment securities we're putting on
continue to be higher than the portfolio rate. So you kind of get benefits from that. But 25 basis points in the grand
scheme of things, it doesn't – it's not going to do that much. And we'll bake it into the guidance in January when
we give it out. But it's really not going to move the dial.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just thinking about the 4Q expense guide, is it right way to think about that? You talked a lot about
the investments being made. Should we think more about that as an acceleration of investments and potentially –
so there's a potential leg down in expense or given everything you guys are doing, is that just better to think about
as run rate at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I can.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Vince, I don't know if you want to comment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Sure, I can comment on that. I mean as Vince talked about, we've continuously invested in the company and you
know that Frank, [ph] it covered us (00:48:17) for a long time. So it's part of how we run the company, investing to
generate future revenue. And we've been able to do that maintaining very good efficiency ratio in the low-50. So
it's just part of running the business. And conversations we have internally are always about focusing our CapEx
spend where we can drive future revenue and investing in markets. Right? We've entered new markets through
the de novo strategy, through expanding our [indiscernible] (00:48:54), Charleston and markets that are very
attractive. So that's also part of the investment, is investing in those new markets which then generates future
revenue for us.
I mean, the expenses in the fourth quarter – it's always – at the end of the year, it can be a little lumpy finishing up
[ph] incentive and accruals (00:49:15) and those types of things that comes in. So when we do our guidance in
January for next year, we'll have a cost savings target as we have every year. I mean, we've taken out $60 million
or so in cost as we've grown and created the scale. So that's always part of how we run the company. And the
initiatives that Vince talked about, the de novo's digital investments, infrastructure to support that growth. We
focus on generating that positive operating leverage and having a low-50% efficiency ratio. So it's not easy, but
it's a focus within the company. And I think investments have served us well. So it'll continue to be part of it. So it's
not really a step function to it, Frank. It's a good question, but it's really just part of how we run the company.

Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then just lastly on the tax rate and the renewable energy transaction and totally get that's just
part of the deal, that's just part of the economics or these tax credits that you get. Would you say that – if I look at
the 4Q 2023 guide, it's a bit lower, I'd say, than your rate over the last several quarters except for this 3Q. Is that –
would you say that's kind of lumpy too? Is there kind of more activity expected in 4Q or is that just – has that
business just ramped up to a degree where you could see that as potentially sustainable?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, the fourth quarter's level, Frank, is really tied to the same solar deal that we just closed in the third quarter.
The bulk of the tax credit gets recorded in the third quarter and then there's carry carryover kind of smoothing out
the effective tax rate for the year that also benefits the fourth quarter and that kind of [indiscernible] (00:51:06) for
this transaction. But [indiscernible] (00:51:08) there's a pipeline of transactions that we continue to go after and
the team is already working actively on others that could happen next year and into 2025. But the 4Q is really just
tied to this transaction and kind of the smoothing of it into the fourth quarter.

slowed a bit again this quarter. Just kind of wondering if you think we're nearing a bottom there, just how you're
thinking about that in general, and maybe just an update on kind of when new loan production is coming on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would say, I guess let me talk to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I don't know. Go ahead, Vince. [indiscernible] (00:52:25) which Vince, Brian was asking. Go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I can comment on the loans and then maybe, Vince, if you want to talk about the strategy of non-interest
bearing afterwards, that'll probably be good. The new loans that we made during the third quarter, they came on
at 6.85% which was up from 6.37% in the second quarter. So the commercial loans came on in 7s and mortgage
is in the mid-to-high 6s during the third quarter and those are kind of mid-7s as we sit here today just given where
mortgage rates are. So 6.85% a pretty good level and above overall portfolio yield. So you're getting that benefit
coming through.
I mean, the overall portfolio rate on a spot basis went up [ph] 50 (00:53:12) basis points. With that higher level of
– made – rates [indiscernible] (00:53:17) loans that we made versus where the portfolio is. And then we have a
slide in the deck, Brian, [ph] that you're (00:53:26) familiar with. I mean, the non-interest-bearing deposits has
been a focus as long as I've been here and Vince before me. We've grown from 16% to – I think we peaked at
34%. We were 26% kind of pre-COVID, right? And we're going to work hard to keep that number as high as we
can. And it's just part of everything we do, every [ph] week at pricing, every outcome meeting (00:53:47) every
board meeting.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, it's actually on page 13 in the investor deck, Brian. And we comment [indiscernible] (00:53:57). But if you
look, it goes to what I've been saying strategically. Our goal was to drive up non-interest bearing deposits.
Basically, I know during the lower interest rate environment, people didn't value them as much. I used to talk
about them all the time, talk about our performance here, and people didn't pay attention because back then, the
benefit – the [indiscernible] (00:54:20) benefit wasn't that great.
But today, it really provides us with a pretty substantial buffer from a margin perspective. And if you go back to
2019, we were at 26%, demand deposits 31% and 20%. I mean, you then can see the surge coming in with
stimulus. So we're feeling pretty good about where we are. We focused on client primacy [indiscernible]
(00:54:49) he has that – he has the trademark on that. So he calls it client primacy. It's our internal strategy to
make sure that we're the principal depository bank and disbursement bank for consumers and businesses. And
again, we continue to make investments in de novo branch locations to drive new households where we can be
the disbursement bank.
On the consumer side, we've invested in digital, we've invested in [indiscernible] (00:55:18) products and
services, like I said, the payment hub that we put in place and some of the other products that we just rolled out
that help us establish ourselves as the principal depository bank. That's why these demand deposits don't move
18

(FNB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
around that much, so relative to others. They're not – it's not just cash parked here. I mean, in many instances
those balances are being used to cover services. The balances have to remain to cover disbursements that go on
throughout a month or a week. So it's pretty much embedded. So we're feeling pretty confident about our deposit
mix here. That's not to say there wasn't pressure, because when rates were lower, of course companies and
individuals, including myself, were a little sloppy about leaving their money sitting in demand deposits. So that's
changed. I think the consumers expect and the businesses expect to invest those balances given the returns they
can achieve today.
So I think we've demonstrated here over a pretty long period of time that we are a very solid depository institution
with a heavy emphasis on low cost funding sources. Anyway. Hope that's helps you.

Yeah. Brian, in terms of the reserve, I mean, it's a constant focus from our perspective. At 1.25% and 1.39% were
the unamortized discounts. I mean, it's upper quartile strong compared to peers, and we feel good about where it
is and the position of the portfolio here entering the end of the year. So I would expect it to continue to track
similarly as we go forward.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Okay. And remind me, Gary, I think there was [indiscernible] (00:57:54) this quarter, some other banks with a
[indiscernible] (00:57:56) portfolio. How big your [indiscernible] (00:57:58) portfolio is today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. [indiscernible] (00:58:01) portfolio today is $3 billion. 40-plus-percent of it is investment grade. And
essentially, the balance of it is essentially right up against investment grade. So, that portfolio has performed
extremely well. It's extremely strong. Our focus – we don't buy paper. Our focus is really on customers that we
know and customers in our market. So, you know that focus has really proven itself very well in that portfolio over
a long period of time. We've generated significant deposits that Vince has referenced around that portfolio as well
and continues to perform exceptionally well. So very strong portfolio.

Got you. Okay.

I hate to answer question now because you can't compare every bank's syndicated loan portfolios. So on the buy
side in particular, we're not a leveraged finance player. We're buying [indiscernible] (00:59:25) if we participate in
a deal, because we think we're going to get ancillary business, we're participating in bond economics.
[indiscernible] (00:59:33) customers, one of the rules we have is that our bankers have to have a relationship with
the company. They can't just rely on Bank of America or PNC to bring us into a deal. Those are – that's a different
type of portfolio than having a [indiscernible] (00:59:49) portfolio that you just go out and buy leverage
transactions in for yield. So to Gary's point, we've a big chunk of investment grade credits in that syndication
portfolio.
And then also we [ph] lead in (01:00:05) number of credits because we have a syndication [indiscernible]
(01:00:08). So that would be included in that number where we're [indiscernible] (01:00:12). So all of that needs to
be taken into consideration [indiscernible] (01:00:17).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. As Vince indicated, we're not in the leveraged finance business. We don't have a private equity business.
It's really customers in our markets that we call on and have relationships with. So it's been a very strong book of
business for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Got you. I appreciate all the color there. And then maybe just last one was on the commercial and consumer
pipeline. I know you're not giving any guidance on 2024, but just kind of given the growth this quarter, just kind of
want to see where the pipelines are at today relative to last quarter, just [ph] have you frame it (01:00:58).

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
[indiscernible] (01:01:02) we're coming off of the previous linked quarter. So typically, what happens is the
pipelines [indiscernible] (01:01:08). I think we're down between 5% and 10% in most of the markets. I just looked
at the statistics across the markets. We track it pretty rigorously. So I'd say down 5% to 10%, but still building. I
think when you look at the portfolio overall, the dynamics of our commercial loan portfolio, one, I think that attrition
has slowed dramatically because of the climb in rates, so that's going to help stabilize the balances. That's
number one. Number two, I think demand for capital has slowed going into next year. So that's part of why the
pipelines have slowed or increased a little bit. Particularly, I focus more on the 90 day pipeline, which is down
about 4% or 5%. That's what I tend to focus on because we look at it both ways, right, [indiscernible] (01:02:04) in
the short run.
And I think it will build again going into next year, obviously, depending on what happens with interest rates and
the economy overall. But I'm pretty confident that [indiscernible] (01:02:20). And then the third thing I wanted to
mention was that utilization rates have declined slightly, which is an indication that there's a pullback. So we're
seeing in the commercial book 1% to 2% decline in utilization rates. And to me, that's an indicator that the
borrowers are [ph] – were kind of pulled back a little bit (01:02:42).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Got you. And in those pipelines...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hope that's helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Yeah. The pipelines you're talking, 4% to 5% lower both for consumer and commercial or was that just primarily
commercial?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No, I'm sorry. I was speaking only to commercial. [indiscernible] (01:03:01) Consumer is – the pipelines for
consumer depends on which [indiscernible] (01:03:08). We want to talk mortgage, so we have more mortgages
than we need [indiscernible] (01:03:12). We're basically becoming more competitive to push [indiscernible]
(01:03:18) off the balance sheet, right? So we're more competitive in the conforming space, which impacts margin
a little bit to get it off the balance sheet. We've been very successful growing [indiscernible] (01:03:30) business.
So I'm not too worried about that. Small business has performed pretty well. Pipelines are up. That's Physicians
First program [indiscernible] (01:03:42) healthcare as you kind of paid off for that group, we have some really
good people that we brought on ahead of our small business lending area has specific expertise in healthcare,
which is why we're developing those products that I mentioned earlier in the call.
The pipeline there looks pretty good. And I think we do have an opportunity moving into 2024, as I said in the
small business segment which falls under consumer to grow that book of business. I mean, we have a boatload of
small business customers across seven states. I mentioned 90,000 to 100,000 customers. So our small business
21

pipeline in the most recent quarter was at record levels, and I would expect us to continue to capitalize on that. I
know it doesn't contribute as much to the total, but that should bode well for the retail consumer bank.
But that's where we are. I don't really – we're not anticipating issues with the mortgage or – so, the mortgage is
tougher, right, in higher interest rate environment. The majority of the loans that we're originating across a pretty
broad footprint are purchase money loans. And we've invested pretty heavily [indiscernible] (01:04:58) platform
recently. So we're pretty confident we can achieve better than peer results in the mortgage business like we have.
And then that leads to home equity opportunities and other opportunities in the consumer segment. And with the
application that we rolled out, we also think that'll help us in 2024. So being able to open depository account and
apply for a home equity loan simultaneously will help us originate loans in the consumer space.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Got you. Okay. And the last one for me was just on the efficiency. Just it feels like given the comments about
managing expenses and what we – we saw this quarter that we should think of the low-50 efficiency ratio as kind
of a sustainable level here going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, we target – we've always said we target 50% to 55%. That's what we hope to achieve. We want to stay
obviously as low as possible, right, because [ph] we're on (01:06:04) incentive to keep expenses low here, part of
our incentive program. So I think that we're going to be very diligent. But I also think given our capital liquidity, our
digital investment, what we have going on here, we need to stay focused on growing revenue as we move
through this difficult time. We're capable of managing risk very effectively. And I think we're in a very strong
position to grow as we move into 2024.
So on the revenue side I believe we'll have an opportunity to manage – at least contribute to positive operating
leverage [indiscernible] (01:06:44) relative to the peers. So there is expense build, but there's also revenue growth
coming along with that. So that's kind of the strategy. It's been the strategy for a long time. I know there's periods
where it's lumpy and people ask why your efficiency ratio is moving. You can see the results over a long period of
time. We've been an outperformer relative to the peers for decades, I believe. So anyway, that's where we are.
