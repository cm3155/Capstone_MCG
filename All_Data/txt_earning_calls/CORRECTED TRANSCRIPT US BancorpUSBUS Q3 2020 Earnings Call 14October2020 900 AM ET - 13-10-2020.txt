I'll now turn the call over to Andy.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry,
Jodi, Mark, and I will take any questions you have. I'll begin on slide 3.
In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.99. Our revenue of $6 billion was higher on both a
linked quarter and year-over-year basis, driven by strong fee income performance across a number of business
lines. Credit quality metrics deteriorated in-line with our expectations, primarily reflecting more challenging
operating conditions for some commercial sectors impacted by COVID-19. However, our reserve build in the third
quarter was limited to the addition related to our acquisition of $1.2 billion of credit card loans from State Farm.
Our capital and liquidity positions remained strong and our deposit mix improved as a third quarter, as demand
deposits increased sharply, while higher cost time deposits declined. The bottom right quadrant of this slide
shows our strong capital position. At September 30, our common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 9.4%.
Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. In the third quarter, we delivered a 16.6% return on tangible common
equity.
Slide 5 shows steady improvement in digital activities. Notably, digital sales now account for more than half of all
loan sales, highlighting how our business investments are supporting our customers' evolving behavior. Digital
remains a focused investment area for us and as more activity moves to the digital channel, it will drive customer
loyalty and top line growth, as well as cost savings and efficiency opportunities.
Now let me turn the call over to Terry, who will provide more color on the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Andy. If you turn to slide 6, I'll start with a balance sheet review, followed by a discussion of third quarter
earnings trends. Average loans declined 2.2% compared with the second quarter. In early July, we added $1.2
billion in credit card loans required as part of our new alliance with State Farm.
Additionally, loans made under the SBA Paycheck Protection Program increased by $2.8 billion on average in the
quarter. Excluding the State Farm and PPP loans, average loans declined by 3.5%, as strong residential
mortgage growth was more than offset by the impact of paydowns in the C&I portfolio, given strong capital
markets activities during the third quarter.
Turning to slide 7, average deposits increased 0.6% compared with the second quarter, and the overall deposit
mix continues to be favorable. Our noninterest bearing deposits grew 15.0%, while time deposits declined 21.7%.
In early October, we closed on the acquisition of $10 billion of deposits from State Farm, which will add to deposit
balances and increase liquidity in the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide 8, as expected under the current economic environment, credit quality deteriorated in the third
quarter. Our net charge-off ratio was 0.66% in the third quarter, up 11 basis points compared with the second

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
quarter, as higher losses in our commercial and commercial real estate portfolios were partially offset by lower
credit card and total other retail net charge-offs.
The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.41% at the end of the third quarter,
compared with 0.38% at the end of the second quarter. Our loan loss provision was $635 million in the third
quarter. The provision amount included $120 million related to the credit card loans acquired from State Farm at
the beginning of the quarter.
Our allowance for credit losses as of September 30 totaled $8.0 billion, or 2.61% of loans. The allowance level
reflected our best estimate of the impact of slower economic growth and elevated unemployment, partially offset
by the consideration of benefits of government stimulus programs.
While estimates are based on many quantitative factors and qualitative judgments, our base case outlook
assumes an unemployment rate of 8.9% for the third quarter, increasing slightly to 9.1% in the fourth quarter of
2020, before declining somewhat to 7.8% by the fourth quarter of 2021.
Slide 9 highlights our key underwriting metrics and loan loss allowance breakdown by loan category. We have a
strong relationship-based credit culture at U.S. Bank, supported by cash flow based lending that considers
sensitivity to stress, proactive management, and portfolio diversification, which allows us to support growth
throughout the economic cycle and produces consistent results.
Turning to slide 10, exposures to certain at-risk segments, given the current environment, are stable compared
with the second quarter. The top left table shows that the volume of payment relief has declined meaningfully
since the second quarter. New requests have reached a steady-state since peaking in April.
Slide 11 provides an earnings summary. In the third quarter of 2020, we earned $0.99 per diluted share.
Turning to slide 12, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.3 billion was up 0.9% compared
with the second quarter, as a 5 basis point increase in our net interest margin offset the impact of a decrease in
loan volume. The increase in the net interest margin was driven by lower cash balances. We expect cash
balances to increase in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the recent acquisition of the deposits from State Farm.
Slide 13 highlights trends in noninterest income. Strength in mortgage banking and commercial product revenue
drove the year-over-year increase, while linked quarter growth reflected higher payments revenue and deposit
service charges, as consumer spend activity continued to recover from second quarter [ph] lows. (08:11)
Slide 14 provides information about our payment services business lines, including exposures to the impacted
industries. Year-over-year payments revenue was pressured by reduced consumer spend compared with pre-
COVID levels. However, consumer sales trends improved throughout the quarter as state and local economies
continued to improve and spend activity increased.
In the third quarter, credit and debit card revenue benefited from the processing of state unemployment
distribution programs that utilize our prepaid cards. We expect this activity to moderate in the fourth quarter. Over
the long term, payments revenues are closely tied to spend activity and the resultant sales volume trends.
Turning to slide 15, noninterest expenses increased 7.2% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher costs
related to the pre [prepaid] card business, COVID-19-related expenses, and higher revenue-related costs from
mortgage and capital markets production. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expenses increased 1.6%.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
Relative to our expectations, we saw an increase in medical claims expenses as employees regained access to
medical services following the stay-at-home orders and higher revenue-related costs tied to the mortgage and
capital markets activities and, most notably, higher prepaid card processing activities.
Slide 16 highlights our capital position. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio at September 30 was 9.4%.
I'll now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect fully taxable-equivalent
net interest income to be flat to down slightly. We expect mortgage revenue to decline somewhat compared to the
third quarter, reflecting slower refinancing activity for the industry and seasonality. Payments revenue is likely to
continue to be adversely affected on a year-over-year basis due to reduced consumer and business spend
activity.
We expect noninterest expenses to be relatively stable compared to the third quarter. We expect net charge-offs
and nonperforming assets to continue to increase from current levels, reflective of economic conditions. Future
levels of reserves will depend on a number of factors, including loan production, size and mix, changes in the
outlook for credit quality, reflecting both economic conditions and portfolio performance, and any beneficial offset
from government stimulus. We will continue to assess the adequacy of the allowance for losses as credit
conditions change.
For the full year of 2020, we expect our taxable-equivalent tax rate to be approximately 19%.
I will hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Terry. The economy is showing signs of recovery, but consumer spending remains below pre-COVID
levels, the unemployment rate is high by historical standards, and the outlook remains uncertain. However, we
are well-positioned to navigate through a more challenging economic and interest rate environment. We're well-
reserved, well-capitalized, and our liquidity position is strong.
We remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders by delivering above-average returns on
equity through the cycle driven by both superior PPNR results and credit performance. Our third quarter earning
results highlights the benefits of our diversified business mix and our credit underwriting discipline.
We are optimistic that we can continue to win market share over time across our high-return fee businesses, such
as mortgage, payments, and trust and investment services. We will continue to adjust our strategy as consumer
preferences evolve, including adjusting our distribution network.
Our alliance with State Farm, which brings our digital banking capabilities together with over 1,900 (sic) [19,000]
State Farm agents, is an example how we can meaningfully expand our reach in a low-cost, highly efficient way.
Separately, about 18 months ago, we announced the branch transformation initiative, aimed at better serving our
customers in light of their evolving preferences. At that time, we announced that we would close 10% to 15% of
our branches by early 2021.
To date, we have closed about 10%. We now plan to close an additional 15%, by early 2021. The majority of
these additional closures were branches that were impacted by COVID-19 and they will remain closed.

While physical branches and personal interactions will always be important, we need fewer branches today than
we did even a few years ago. And the branches of the future need to be more advice centers than locations
where transactions take place.
I'll conclude on slide 17. Our culture has always been a key differentiator of the U.S. Bank story, and we remain
committed to supporting our customers, our communities, and our employees in the good times, as well as the
more challenging times.
While it has always been important to us, today there is even a greater emphasis on ensuring that we do that in a
deliberately, inclusive way. I want to thank our employees who bring our culture to life every day and for all their
hard work throughout the year.
We'll now open up the call to Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Your first question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Just on that comment regarding the branches, can you help us think about the cost impact of the step-up in the
consolidation of the branches? Is that factored into your expectations of expenses? And, I guess, if you can kind
of just elaborate on how you see expenses trajecting and if this could impact your efficiency expectations.
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. John, great question. And when we think about expenses, our goal is, especially in this environment, to be
able to manage expenses relatively flat. And it is one of the things that we have kind of considered or factored into
that process. The cost saves associated with the branches will be important.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
Part of that, we do expect will flow to the bottom line; and part of it, we'll continue to use to reinvest in our
business, particularly in the digital capabilities. And kind of as you can imagine, the more we're investing in that,
the greater the opportunity with respect to future cost savings will come as well. So that's kind of how we're
thinking about it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. And then, just one more thing on that front. Are you also – do you also see opportunities to ratchet up
corporate real estate rationalization outside of the branches? And could that be incremental savings on top of
this?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, we'll look not only at the branches. We'll also look at our corporate real estate. One of the things that
we're still kind of working through is what does the next horizon from a workforce management perspective look
like, because that will obviously impact corporate real estate. But I do think that there's opportunity for us to be
able to consolidate as we think about 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thanks, Terry. And then just one more thing on the revenue side. I know that your fees definitely came in
better this quarter helped by the card and processing fees. And I just want to get your thought on your payments
revenues, given just where you see consumer and corporate payments trajecting over the next several months. I
know you commented on the prepaid card expectation, but I wanted to get your thoughts more broadly on the
payments trajectory here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, one thing I would say is that since the second quarter, we've continued to see improvement in
consumer and business spend, which is good across all of those different areas. And if you end up looking at the
one slide, you'll see that excluding the airline, travel, entertainment, the sales – consumer spend has actually
come back very nicely. And so I think that on a go-forward basis, the impacts will be really some of those at-risk
industries for some period of time.
Ultimately, the trajectory of growth in the payments business will be tied to that consumer and business spend
overall. There will be a little bit of lumpiness in the third quarter, for example, with respect to the prepaid card,
which is really driven by the stimulus programs. If we see a stimulus program in the fourth or first quarter, that
might give us a little bit of lift, but it's not something that we're contemplating at this particular point in time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
And I would just add – this is Andy, John – that, as Terry mentioned, we see continued improvement across all
three categories: merchant acquiring, credit card issuing, as well as the corporate payment system. The trough for
all those occurred in April. And each and every month since then, there's been slight improvement in spend
across all those categories.

Hi, Bill.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Hi. Good morning, Andy and Terry. It sounds like you guys have the unemployment rate rising from here. Is that
just conservatism or is there something else that you guys are seeing? If you could just give a little bit of color on
the top line.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I don't think it's anything specific that we're seeing. I do think, Bill, that maybe our expectation, if you think
about corporate America, you're starting to see some reductions in force, whether it's in the airline industry and
some of the entertainment industries. I think that because of the stimulus programs that have existed, some of
those companies have deferred taking some of those actions. Our expectation, as we think about the fourth
quarter, is some of those actions are going to impact the unemployment levels before they start to come back
down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Understood. And I guess a separate question is, how would you characterize your gearing to the short-end versus
the long-end of the curve? And if there's any sensitivity that you could give, that would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A

Interest rate sensitivity in short and long end.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, maybe just stepping back, our balance sheet is about 50% floating, 50% fixed. We'll continue to see a
little bit of churn on the fixed side for some period of time. We're always looking for opportunities to be able to
reinvest in the investment portfolio with a little bit more duration and will kind of continue to manage that.
Our asset/liability position widens – so we're asset-sensitive, and that widened in the first quarter quite a bit. And
since then, it's been relatively stable. And we'll continue to kind of manage that way for some period of time.
When we bring on the deposits, as an example, we'll hold that generally on the short-end by increasing liquidity
levels, because I think that future opportunity in terms of rate increases is a better trade-off than investing it
immediately today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Got it. Thanks, Terry. And if I could squeeze in one last one. Some of your competitors have hedging programs in
place that have served as a source of support for their net interest margins, but you guys haven't benefited
materially from hedges. And, I guess, as hedges begin to roll off, that should benefit you guys relative to others,
because you won't have to deal with those future headwinds. Is that by design? Or, I guess, just wondering if
there's any color that you can give around hedging strategy and positioning [indiscernible] (00:20:19).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Historically, we typically just use the balance sheet as a way of kind of hedging or setting up our
asset/liability position. So, we utilize, for example, duration and composition of our investment portfolio in order to
do that. So we don't do a lot of active hedging. I will tell you, though, we did do some hedging middle of last year.
And when rates came down nicely, we were able to lock in the gains associated with it, which I think will help a
bit. But it's not a major part of our program.

Good morning, Andy. Can you guys give us some additional color? I noticed and you pointed out in the call that
you took some charge-offs in commercial real estate in the COVID-related sectors. Can you give us some color of
what you're seeing in terms of the write-downs that are required to move through this period of time with these
types of sectors?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Runkel A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, good morning, Gerard. This is Mark Runkel. I'll answer that question. First off, I would just start off by saying
our credit quality is performing in line with our expectations at this point. And as you know, we have a couple
guiding principles in how we think about managing credit. First being – is that we stay very consistent in our
underwriting throughout the cycle. Number two is we're very proactive at identifying and working through problem
credits when they arise.
And so, what I would say is, the result of that is as – and you'll have seen this as our criticized commitments did
increase early in the downturn in this particular cycle. And so, as we think of our charge-offs, the level of charge-
offs, at least this quarter, did increase as a result of that. So it's really a timing issue. And in the end, we think
we're going to continue to have very superior credit quality performance throughout the economic cycle.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
And I know, Mark, we've been very actively managing that portfolio of the at-risk industries in order to bring that
exposure down.

Gerard Cassidy Q

And within these portfolios, I don't know if there was any hotel properties that may have had to be written down.
What are you actually seeing in terms of on a individual credit basis, are you seeing 10% or 15% write-down, the
ones that you do have to write-down?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Runkel A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, I think – I mean, that's exactly the range that we're currently seeing on those properties. And it's really
property-specific, so it does vary greatly. But those that are the most distressed are in that kind of range that you
talked about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I see. And then just as a follow-up, some of the bigger universal money center type banks have discussed that the
consumer net charge-offs, because of the support from the fiscal programs and other types of programs, may be
pushed out into the second half of 2021. So, it's not necessarily avoiding them, it's just the timing of it. Do you
guys have any color on the consumer side what you're seeing in terms of the potential for charge-offs?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I would echo those comments, Gerard. This is Andy. The credit stats for the consumer portfolio are really good
right now. And the indicators, the delinquencies, all those facts are more positive than you would expect, given
the economic environment that we're in. Part of that certainly is due to the stimulus plans, the unemployment
benefits, all those things, which is creating a bit of a bridge. I do expect that, at some point in 2021, we'll start to
see an acceleration of credit deterioration in the consumer portfolios once those benefits start to wear down.

Hey, Erika.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I'm wondering big incremental announcement on identifying another 15% of your branches that you will take
offline, and I'm wondering if you could help quantify the cost savings that you expect to derive from those closures
and the timing of when that starts impacting your run rate positively.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yes. When we end up looking at the potential savings associated with those branches, it's kind of in that $150
million range, plus or minus. We do expect to see that that impact will really start to hit our run rate even in the
first quarter. But again, just as a reminder, some of that will come through in terms of expense opportunity or
benefit, and some of it's going to get reinvested in digital capabilities, which will also have an impact in terms of
expenses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
And, Erika, I want to reiterate a point I made in my prepared remarks, which is that as you think about the
additional 15%, the great majority – around 75% or so of those branches already have been closed as a result of
COVID during this period. So what they really are is resulting in a permanent closure. And again, all of this
reflects changes in customer behaviors and activities.
We saw an acceleration of digital transactions and sales. You saw the sales numbers on lending activity. And that
only accelerated during the COVID period, and that's – the result is what we're doing. And again, about 75% of
those have already been closed for the last few months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. Thank you. And as a follow-up to that, outside perhaps of those potential savings, you have been pretty
good at calling out COVID-related expenses. I guess it was $49 million this quarter, $79 million last quarter. And
as we think about your statement in terms of running expenses flat, shall we think about those expenses dropping
off in the 2021 run rate, or are those expenses related to COVID going to be reinvested elsewhere in 2021?

Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Well, a little bit of both. So when we think about 2021, we do expect that some of those COVID-related expenses
will continue at least into the early part of the year until the kind of return-to-work environment starts to settle in.
And then savings associated with that, again, part of it will accrue to the bottom line and part of it will be a part of
our reinvestment in our business as we think about going forward.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just one more follow-up question. Clearly, a strong quarter. I think we continue to get pushback from
portfolio managers in terms of owning banks due to the interest rate outlook. And as we think about your outlook
for the fourth quarter of NII flat to down slightly, are you confident that without any further changes in the rate
outlook, that we'll see the bottom in net interest income in the fourth quarter and anything from here, whether it's
higher inflation, better growth, or the yield curve re-steepening would be an opportunity?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think it's a little hard to call exactly when net interest income kind of hits the trough. I mean, part of it – I
mean, there's so many different puts and takes in terms of loan demand and where interest rates kind of go from
here, what the impact of premium amortization is. There's just a lot of puts and takes. So, I think it's a little bit
early for us to say, for example, it's in 2020.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning. So first, I'm going to make just a request, especially since you're on the call, Andy, since I know
this wouldn't happen without you. I know you guys just put out your list of earnings calls dates for 2021. Two of
them overlap at exactly the same starting time as another major bank.
So I'm hoping that you can give Jen and team the authorization to do something, so that we all don't have to
choose between which one to listen to. Since trying to listen to two is never going to work. So, since it's one is in
April and one is in October, and it's 6 and 12 months away, I'm hoping between the two banks, you all can find the
time. And I can follow-up with Jen as to which those two are. So that's just a...

[indiscernible] (00:29:30).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. You know what, we keep trying to. And I've been told by IR if I don't ask the question on the call, I can't get
the answers to my questions. So, Terry, a little bit of color. Your hotel exposure, can you give us some sense of
the mix, type of hotels, urban versus small town, upscale, budget? Any color on that? And also the percentage of
criticized in your COVID-related exposures.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
That's a perfect question for Mark.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Runkel A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. No, I'll share with the lodging exposure. I'd say we have a great diversification by geography and property
types. It's a mix between urban and suburban, so we've got great distribution there. And then – so we feel really
good with where that's at. In terms of the criticized commitments for those impacted industries, we'll have to
follow-up and get you that offline.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's great. And then, Mark, I'm going to follow-up on credit, a comment that I think Terry made. NCOs to
rise further, but, Andy, you said consumer charge-offs to come more next year. Terry's comment was NCOs to
rise further in fourth quarter. Is that, therefore, still to come in commercial, and which categories are you expecting
that? Any color on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Runkel A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think, as Andy noted, the consumer side continues to be very strong and our delinquencies, where they
ended the end of the quarter, were in a really good spot. So we think that will continue to hold true through the
remainder of this year. I think we're continuing to work through some of those impacted industries on the
commercial and commercial real estate side. And really in the commercial real estate side, it's going to be more in
the malls, as well as our lodging exposure that we'll continue to work through, through the remainder of this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Part of that, Vivek, is Mark and team being very active in terms of reducing our exposure where we think the
highest risk categories are. So, as we've talked about in the past, we try to be very proactive around this and
managing our exposures down in a very early fashion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Okay, great. Thanks, Andy, Terry, Mark.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Good morning.

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Peter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I'm just curious with the outlook for the unemployment rate to move higher, would that suggest
that there could be some additional reserve building in the fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Peter, no, that was something that has been a part of our outlook for when we were looking at the analysis
in the second quarter. And so, we don't think that that would have any impact on CECL. In fact, at this particular
point in time, based upon what we know, we wouldn't expect any additional reserve build.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then, Andy, I look at the capital ratios and the reserve levels, which are very strong, if the Fed were to
lift that restriction on share buybacks and just keep it for the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about your view on
buying back stock, assuming no more Fed restrictions?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
If we have capacity, we'll do that, Peter. We're all – the large banks are going through the CCAR resubmission
process right now. I think that will inform a lot of us in terms of the Fed's direction into 2021. So that's what we're
looking at.

Operator: Your next question comes from Christopher Spahr with Wells Fargo Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hi, Christopher.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning. Hi. How are you? Good morning. So regarding the payments growth this past quarter, how much
do you think of that's kind of green shoots and how much of that was kind of temporary, say, from the stimulus?
And what do you think is going to trend into the fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Certainly, when you think about the third quarter, I think the trajectory was helped because of the stimulus
program, and I think that's the reason why you saw such a strong kind of recovery from the second quarter. So
clearly, it's being impacted.
When you think about the fourth quarter, I think the increase in sales levels will be more commensurate with what
we have seen kind of pre-COVID just in terms of the – what I would call, excluding the airline, travel, and
entertainment. So, on a year-over-year basis, clearly, it's still going to be down because of those at-risk industries
and the impact that consumer spend has had on that. But regarding kind of the core other spend level, it's
recovered very nicely.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then as a follow-up, Andy, you've talked about your digital opportunities, whether it's merchant
processing and B2B. But your metrics that you give are mostly consumer-oriented. Can you give some additional
color on what you think could be – like how your commercial customers changed their behavior and what do you
think are going to be the revenue and expense benefits, say, in 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yes, Christopher. So, I think the consumer probably is a little bit ahead of the corporate commercial in terms of
migration to digital activities. Part of it is because many of them are already there and some of the new rails that
are being built will impact that on a go-forward basis. So, that continues to remain a huge opportunity, probably
more into 2021 as we think about the platform around merchant processing, business banking, treasury
management, and corporate payments, all coming together to serve our corporate, commercial and business
customers. So, that's probably a little bit more a 2021 event and we'll continue to report on that for you, so we
could report our progress.

Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Scott.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Terry, just sort of a quick question on your thoughts on
liquidity deployment. Everybody's sort of, I guess, struggling with this high class problem of excess deposits. Just
curious about how you're thinking about willingness or appetite to deploy some of that, just given the challenging
interest rate environment? So just very top level question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Again, when you end up looking at kind of the investment alternatives that are out there, you hate to kind of
lock in to low rates over a long period of time. So as a result, I think you're going to see, not only for us but in the
industry, liquidity levels being fairly high and waiting for the longer end of the curve to kind of come up a bit.
That said, in the investment portfolio, we'll look for opportunities to extend duration, to some extent, and to make
some investments a little bit further out in the curve in order to be able to deploy it. We feel like the liquidity levels
that we have today are pretty good, taking into consideration the incremental $10 billion that'll come in, which we'll
keep pretty much on the short end.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe on the other side of the balance sheet, you can see through the [ph]
HA (00:37:22) data and in all the numbers that are coming out, I mean everybody's kind of struggling with this
evaporation of loan demand. Just curious at a high level, what signs you guys are looking to or what sort of mile
markers there are as to when that would begin to reverse? So I guess the answers could be, whether it's vaccine,
election, more certainty, who knows, but just curious, given how much of the country you guys see, what you're
thinking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
One of the greatest impacts in the third quarter was the bond issuance. So if you think about the decline in
corporate commercial, about 40% of that was from companies taking advantage of a low interest rate
17


U.S. Bancorp

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
environment and issuing debt, and about 60% was related to companies just reducing their balance sheet
because they are seeing strong earnings, they're seeing high productivity. So, those two factors – the debt
issuance will really be a function of the interest rate environment and the yield curve going forward, and I would
expect that to moderate because there was so much activity in the third quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you, guys, very much. I appreciate it.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Good morning. First off, you said that you expected the non-T&E card spend to have the growth recover to
around where it was pre-COVID. But just in terms of the mix there, are you still expecting a bigger mix in debit
than was the case pre-COVID?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I'm sorry, the second part of your question was?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
In terms of the mix in the consumer card spend between debit and credit, are you still expecting the mix of debit
versus credit to be more weighted towards debit in the near term?

Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp

U.S. Bancorp
(USB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2020
Yeah, I do. I think that people again are being fairly cautious. And so they're utilizing the debit card because they
can more effectively manage their liquidity. So when they have cash balances in their savings account and, as
you know, savings levels are fairly high still on the consumer side, I think they're using their debit card a little bit
more than what they have in the past. And so throughout the entire timeframe, debit card sales have actually
strengthened during that timeframe compared to credit card. So I do think the mix would continue to change a
little bit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
And then on the branch closures, it sounds like the gross savings there will be around $150 million. But are you
expecting any onetime costs from stepping up the branch consolidation? And can you help us get any sense of
the timing and magnitude we might expect there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So in the third quarter, we did take a charge associated with the closure of the branches. It is included in
other revenue, because it's principally related to asset impairments. Offsetting that, though, were some equity
investment gains that if you end up looking at those two things on a net basis, we're essentially neutral to the fee
income and the bottom line.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Great. So you're not expecting any adjustments going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
No, we don't expect any further. We don't expect any further.
