Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the U.S. Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Following a
review of the results, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be
recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 8:00 am Central Time.
I will now turn the conference call over to George Andersen, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor
Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
George Andersen
Director, Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp
Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman and President and Chief
Executive Officer, Andy Cecere; our Vice Chair and Chief Administration Officer, Terry Dolan; and our Senior
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Stern. With their prepared remarks, Andy and John will
be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental
analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.
Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty.
Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's
presentation, our earnings release, our Form 10-K, and in subsequent reports on file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
Following our prepared remarks, Andy, Terry, and John will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the
call over to Andy.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'll begin on slide 3. In the fourth
quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.49, which included $0.50 per share of notable items that John will
discuss in more detail. Excluding these notable items, earnings per share totaled $0.99 in the fourth quarter.
For the fourth quarter, on an adjusted basis, net revenue totaled $6.9 billion and for the full year, we generated
record net revenue of $28.3 billion. We demonstrated strength across our fee businesses which helped to offset
pressure on net interest income.
Turning to slide 4, total loans were lower on a linked quarter basis by 1.1%, reflecting slower demand, particularly
in corporate lending and continued focus on lending opportunities that meet our return hurdles. Average deposits
declined compared with the third quarter as our strong funding position allowed us to be more disciplined on
deposit pricing, while maintaining our liquidity profile. Credit quality continued to normalize towards pre-pandemic
levels this quarter, and we further strengthened the balance sheet by adding $49 million to our loan loss reserve.
As of December 31, tangible book value per share increased 14.7% from a year ago and our common equity tier
1 capital ratio ended the year at 9.9%, an increase of 20 basis points this quarter. This ratio is 150 basis points
higher than when we completed the acquisition of Union Bank in the fourth quarter of 2022. Supported by our

strong capital accretion this year, the board approved an increase to our quarterly common dividend in December
to $0.49 per common share.
Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. On an adjusted basis, we delivered 19.6% return on tangible common
equity in the fourth quarter and 21.7% return on tangible common equity for the full year.
Let me now turn the call over to John who will provide more details on the quarter as well as forward-looking
guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Andy. Turning to slide 6. We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.49 for the quarter or $0.99 per
share after adjusting for notable items. Notable items totaled $1.1 billion on a pre-tax basis or $780 million net of
tax, representing a $0.50 reduction per diluted common share, including an FDIC special assessment charge of
$734 million, offset by a benefit from tax settlements in the quarter.
Other notable items this quarter included merger and integration costs of $171 million, a charitable contribution to
fund our community benefits plan of $110 million, and a balance sheet optimization charge of $118 million. This
quarter, we opportunistically restructured a portion of our investment securities portfolio which we expect will
enhance our net interest income trajectory, while also strengthening our capital and liquidity positioning.
Slide 7 provides a more detailed earnings summary for the quarter.
Turning to slide 8, we continued to manage the balance sheet prudently as we saw reduced loan demand this
quarter and the competition for deposits remained heightened as system-wide liquidity declined. Total assets
ended the year at $663 billion. Average loans declined 1.1% on a linked quarter basis as growth in credit card
loans supported by consumer spending and low payment rates was more than offset by weaker commercial loan
demand. Average deposits declined 1.9% linked quarter. Given our strong deposit balances in the third quarter,
we moderated our deposit pricing somewhat in the fourth quarter even as we grew consumer deposits by 1%.
During the quarter, we rebalanced a portion of our securities portfolio which provided risk-weighted asset relief
and improved our overall earnings trajectory. The average yield on total investment securities portfolio increased
2.97% for the fourth quarter, a 55-basis point increase compared to a year earlier. As of December 31, the ending
balance on the total investment securities portfolio was $161 billion. During the quarter, effective duration on the
available-for-sale portfolio declined to less than three years as unrealized losses, net of tax, improved by
approximately $2 billion given the movement in rates and repositioning.
Turning to slide 9, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined 3.0% linked quarter, driven by a
modest decline in the net interest margin of 2.78%. The 3-basis point decline in the net interest margin reflected
market dynamics including deposit pricing pressure and unfavorable shifts in the deposit mix, partially offset by
better earning asset spreads and improved total funding mix.
In the first quarter of 2024, we expect net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis to be in the range of
$4.0 billion to $4.1 billion. For the full year 2024, we expect net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis
to be consistent with our annualized fourth quarter 2023 net interest income level of approximately $4.14 billion to
up slightly.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Slide 10 highlights trends in non-interest income. Non-interest income, as adjusted, increased 12.1% on a year-
over-year basis, driven by new account growth and deepening relationships across the business. Year-over-year
payment service revenue benefited by continued strength in consumer and business spending activities, while
increases in trust and investment management fees and commercial product revenue were driven by underlying
market activity, a full fourth quarter with Union Bank, and core growth.
Turning to slide 11, non-interest expense, as adjusted, decreased by 1.0% on a linked quarter basis, driven by
lower compensation-related expense that was partially offset by strategic investments in marketing and business
development.
Slide 12 highlights our credit quality performance. Asset quality metrics trended in line with expectations and key
metrics continued to normalize to our pre-pandemic levels. Our ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other
real estate was 0.40% at December 31, compared with 0.35% at September 30 and 0.26% a year ago. The fourth
quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.49% increased 5 basis points from a third quarter level of 0.44% and was higher
when compared to a fourth quarter 2022 level of 0.23%, as adjusted.
Turning to slide 13, we increased our common equity tier 1 ratio to 9.9% as of December 31. The combination of
earnings accretion, net of distributions, and balance sheet optimization actions, resulted in a 20 basis point
increase linked quarter. Balance sheet optimization activities continue to have a low to neutral impact on earnings
and provided additional risk transfer benefits.
As we move into 2024, we expect earnings to be in the – we expect earnings to be the primary driver of capital
accretion with limited reliance on balance sheet capital-related actions. As of December 31, 2023, our common
equity tier 1 capital ratio remains above our regulatory capital minimum by 290 basis points.
Let me now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, John. I'll end my prepared comments on slide 14. 2023 was a turbulent year for the industry. However,
we achieved a great deal, including our successful conversion of Union Bank in late May and the realization of
$900 million in run rate cost synergies related to Union Bank by year end as we had targeted. Additionally, we
accomplished our goal of accelerating the accretion of CET1 capital and received full relief from Category II
commitments we made in conjunction with the Union Bank transaction.
Entering 2024, we are positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading returns on tangible common equity, are
appropriately reserved for macroeconomic uncertainties, and remain confident in our strategy for future growth
and expansion. We are seeing positive momentum across our fee-based businesses as we deepen our most
profitable client relationships and continue to target flat expense growth in 2024, even as we strategically invest in
key areas and further execute on revenue growth opportunities with Union Bank.
Let me close by thanking our employees for their continued dedication to supporting the needs of our clients,
communities, and shareholders in what was a meaningful year for the company.
We'll now open up the call for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first
question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thanks, everybody. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning.
[indiscernible] (00:10:46)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. John, I was hoping you could maybe provide a little more context around the NII thoughts for the full year. It
sounds like, if I did the math correctly, we're expecting somewhere between $16.5 billion and $16.6 billion for the
full year. Maybe just some thoughts on how the margin and NII should traject. I would presume maybe a little
more downward pressure on NII given day count in the first quarter, but the trough there and then sort of growth
throughout the year, or would there be other factors that would cause NII maybe to bleed through, say, middle of
the year and then start to inflect back upward, maybe just any thoughts there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. Good morning, Scott. Thank you. Maybe just to reiterate what was mentioned, in the first quarter, we'll see
net interest income between $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion. As we think about the full year for 2024, it's going to be
consistent with our annualized fourth quarter number, 2023 level of $4.1 billion, $4 billion, and to up slightly. And
we're using the fourth quarter actuals really because we feel that's a more appropriate starting point given our
balance sheet is now past all the capital actions that took place during the 2023 calendar year.
And so, some of the color around that and some of the drivers related to how we are thinking about that as we –
we do believe that DDA and low cost deposit churn into higher cost deposits are going to abate over time. By the
end of this quarter, we'll be nine months past the last Fed hike, as an example. We continue to see loan spreads
improve in various categories [ph] led (00:12:23) on the commercial side of things. Loan and investment portfolio
asset churn continues to occur. Our loan pipelines have continued to strengthen over this quarter, certainly
stronger than we've seen in the past couple of quarters. And we think that loan demand should be improved just
given that the Fed is likely going to be in a cutting mode over time.
And the counter to that, of course, is that deposit pricing is going to be competitive, especially with QT running in
some form in the background. So, I'll say that first quarter NII projection is going to be slightly lower than the
fourth quarter. These broad factors are really going to be supportive of NII growth especially as we think about the
second half of the year.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, maybe just a quick question on capital. Glad to hear that some of those
balance sheet optimization efforts are beginning to sunset. Maybe one, do you have what you all estimate the sort
of fully loaded common equity tier 1 ratio to be now and maybe the balance between just building and potentially
returning capital going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, I mean, right now, as you know, we're at 9.9% on CET1. With the improvement in rates, the impact of
the AOCI on the investment portfolio securities is about 2.2 percentage points. And so, you're at 7.7%.
As we think about – on a fully loaded basis. So, if you think about it on a go-forward basis, we're going to create
capital in the area of 20 basis points to 25 basis points per quarter. We will have a burn down on that securities
book of about 30% or so relative to where it is by the end of 2025, just to give you some context. So, all that kind
of adds up to building our capital to where we think it needs to be for the appropriate time given regulation and the
timing of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Just maybe, John, following up on the NII question, one, sorry if I missed it, what rate cut assumptions did you
have in your NII outlook? And then, just talk to us about sensitivity. Are three cuts worse than six cuts? Just how

we should, given market expectations around this probably is going to change week-by-week? I'm just trying to
test the resiliency of your NII outlook if we get more or less rate cuts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. Absolutely. So, in terms of our current projections, we have four interest rate cuts by the Fed starting in the
second quarter of this year. Now, whether or not that's two cuts or six cuts, it's not going to be a material driver to
our outlook. We have worked hard to get our net interest income sensitivity to be more or less in a neutral
position. And so, we feel like whether the cuts are – how they're positioned are not going to be a material driver to
the change – the outlook. Excuse me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And I guess just a second question. I'm not sure if you laid out any outlook for fee revenue growth
for the year in terms of – if you can just talk to in terms of what you expect overall in fee revenues, and particularly
on payments, if you can call out expectations on what you assume for the year there. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. Yeah. I'll call out a couple things on payments and some of the other fee categories. So, as we think about
payments, certainly in terms of merchant processing, we've put a lot of investment in there. There's a lot of
technology-led advancements that we made in terms of connections and certainly some MUB synergies. And so,
we continue to expect high-single digits in terms of revenue growth there.
The same would be said for corporate payments. We think high-single digits given the amount of T&E growth and
client growth and all that sort of thing that we see. And then, on the card side of things, we've seen a very nice
margin expansion. MUB certainly helps and holiday sales have been or certainly helpful this past quarter, but we
see that extending. And so, we think mid-single digits from that standpoint.
I would also reiterate, we had really very nice growth in the commercial product side. We've had – particularly in
2023, we would expect high-single digits there given strength we've had in foreign exchange. Derivatives, the
fixed income capital markets, loan syndications, all been performing very well for us. Our trust investment
management fee also should experience growth led by our institutional service businesses and corporate trust
and fund services and certainly in wealth management, some of the fees associated with that.
The one thing I would point out though in terms of service charges, we have – we've exited our ATM cash
servicing business, and that was a business we decided to exit just given the high level of capital related to it in
terms of intensity and investment. And so, that will impact us by about $30 million to $35 million per quarter
starting in the first quarter.

John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
John, thanks for the color so far on the guidance. I guess, similarly, can you walk through your – within the NII
expectation that you provided, can you walk through your expectation for loan growth for the year and how you
expect that could traject? I know you're citing demand weakening. And then, same thing on the deposit front. Can
you maybe give us your expectation on how you think growth can look like on the – on an overall basis and
maybe how the net interest – I mean, the non-interest bearing mix could traject from here? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. So, a couple of things there. So, I'll start in the loan growth side. I do believe our expectations is that we will
see growth in the commercial side. Of course, that was a little bit weaker this last quarter as we experienced pay-
downs particularly as clients were accessing capital markets and things of that nature. But we've seen really a
good pipeline build in that. We expect utilization to pick up and things of that variety. So, we feel like that along
with credit cards will be good sources of growth for us as we think about loan growth going forward.
On the deposit side, as a reminder, we'll probably be lower in the first quarter. We seasonally lose deposits just as
we kind of go through the year-end process. And just given the mix of our businesses, deposits end up being a
little bit lower in the first quarter, but then, we see more or less stabilization. But there might be some headwind
there particularly depending on QT and how the Fed draining of liquidity out of the system will impact the numbers
there.
And then, going into your NIB comment, we've seen of course rotation out of NIB into other interest-bearing
products. That continues, but starts to wane as we go throughout the year. And again, as I mentioned, we're
going to be nine months by the end of this quarter past the last Fed hike and that gives us some signal that that
will begin to abate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thank you for that. And then, I guess, if you could help us just think about how we should think about the
magnitude of operating leverage that's reasonable as you look at next year. I know we do have some color on
how you're thinking about NII and fees and then – put that against your efforts to keep expenses stable. But I
guess, if you could just maybe frame it, the range of operating leverage that you think is reasonable as we look at
next year.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Good morning, John. This is Andy. So, let me start with this, and John can add on. So, as I said in my prepared
remarks, we're going to benefit from the cost efficiencies of the Union deal to a total of $900 million, and that is
fully reflected now in the run rate starting this quarter.
So, we're achieving those benefits because of the benefits of technology, investments we've made, digital
investments, operational investments, our risk platform. And so, that is the benefit of the investments we've made.
And we would expect to continue to invest in the business in those capabilities and payments and technology
modernization.
So, we are also very cognizant in managing expenses very closely. We still have opportunities in terms of
efficiencies in personnel, in operations, in activities around technology that will allow us to more efficiently deliver
the services we have. So, I would expect as we get towards the second half of the year that when we start to see
that margin growth that John talked about as well as the fee normalization, that we would have opportunity for
positive operating leverage and we're going to – again, that is our long-term objective, as always, and we have
levers to pull.

about. Thank you.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
At the end of (00:22:45) going across the portfolio, generally, pretty stable. We did see a couple of idiosyncratic
loans that went into non-performing status. Both of those were kind of Union legacy sort of credits, so continue to
kind of work through that. But I would also say that both of those are fairly well collateralized. So, we don't
necessarily see a lot of charge-off content related to those idiosyncratic credits.
When we look at net charge-offs and the trajectory, I would expect that – we would expect that it will continue to
kind of normalize. Credit card is kind of getting closer to pre-pandemic levels, but that will continue to move up a
little bit. Our expectation is that for full year 2024, we'll probably be in kind of in the mid-50s in terms of the net
charge-off rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. Thanks, Terry. And then, John or Andy, just on the fee revenues, John ticked off on the fee revenues a
number of high-single digit kind of potential growers in 2024. How do we think about kind of the ability to grow
total fee revenues and what kind of base should we use for that? It looks like maybe the adjusted base for 2023
was about $10.8 billion of fee revenues. Is that something you can grow off of that? Just trying to contextualize.
Total revenue last year was around $28 billion. How should we think about the ability to grow revenues on fees
and maybe total revenues this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, I mean, we had, as you mentioned, some of the fee numbers there. From a core fee perspective, we do
expect to grow. I ticked off some of the areas in terms of payments, commercial products, trust, and all that sort of
thing, other – and some of the service charges components there.
Of course, in terms of mortgage, that will be probably somewhat on the flat range. And in terms of other, we had a
little bit of a high number in terms of the fourth quarter related to tax credit, related impact finance, syndication
fees, and things like that. So, all those things, and we expect kind of that mid-single in terms of the fee
components going forward for this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. Kind of a mid-single from that $10.8 billion adjusted base?

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Erika.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. My first question is for you, Andy. Clearly, you went through it in terms of some capital [ph]
consternation (00:25:50) 2023. And now, you're sitting here with 9.9% CET1, no longer have to be a Category II
bank early, and all the color that we're getting from Washington is that Basel III endgame will be at least delayed if
not softened significantly.
As you think about maybe just one more hurdle ahead over the near-term in terms of the DFAST, how are you
thinking about where USB's proper CET1 ratio is in terms of the minimum, looking forward to a future where
maybe capital is a little bit tighter, but you're also growing? And do you feel like you're now on offense and all the
sort of balance sheet management that was designed to optimize capital is fully behind you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Erika, as John mentioned, I think our balance sheet optimization efforts are behind us. Our focus on capital
accretion will be from earnings as we go into 2024 and forward. As we talked about, we're at a 9.9% CET1 ratio
today. A couple of years ago, our target was between 8.5% and 9%. So, we're above that target, but we're also
cognizant of the rules that are coming both from the perspective of Basel III endgame which is still uncertain as
you talked about, as well as CCAR and how that will evolve over time.
So, we will continue to accrete [ph] to 2025 (00:27:14). We'll continue to burn down the AOCI. When we get clarity
on the capital rules, both Basel III and CCAR, we'll then determine what the proper capital target will be. My
expectation is we'll be above the 9% that we were a few years ago, but we'll define that, refine that, and then we'll
get into what the math is around buybacks at that time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And one follow-up question for you, John. Thank you for giving us some of the components of the NII. I'm
just wondering, as you mentioned QT, are you generally expecting deposits to be down, total deposits to be down
even if DDA mix shift abates? And also, how quickly do you think the deposit betas on the way down can react to
each Fed rate cut?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. So, the first part of your question in terms of QT, we do anticipate QT to be throughout the year. And so,
that's going to, on whole, put pressure on deposits throughout the year in terms of balances. And so, we don't
expect a lot of growth overall in deposits, but we'll – we have ways to manage through that. Of course, they're
talking through various ways to change the QT but that just remains to be seen.

In terms of deposits performance on the way down, I would anticipate commercial and wholesale type balances
will go down just as fast as they would come up. On the retail side, it's going to be more of an arc. It'll take some
time for that to turn. But those are our expectations.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hey. Good morning, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, I wasn't clear. Are you guiding for flat, positive, or negative operating leverage or none of the above for 2024?
And more generally, I mean, the real question is, when do you get back to your historical efficiency ratio? I think
you talked about this at a presentation in December. I mean, 61% core efficiency in the fourth quarter isn't exactly
like legacy U.S. Bancorp, and that's up 300 basis points year-over-year. And earlier last decade, you were 55%
and going back further, you were in the low-50s. Is that just a aspirational target now, or is there a real target over
the next two years or so? And along those lines, I guess, you have all the savings you're going to get from Union
Bank, so where does the rest come from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Mike, it's probably more likely a positive operating leverage in the second half of 2024 versus the first half
given some of the margin pressures that we talked about. That is still our objective. My expectation is, once we
get more to our normalized revenue level that we will continue to manage expenses below revenue growth and
continue to tick down that efficiency ratios into the 50s. That's the way we're planning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
When you say into the 50s, I mean, is it – can you get back to 55%? Is that in your planning horizon even going
out a few more years? And it looks like the payments business is re-catching its stride here. And along those
lines, I didn't see the slide anymore on the payments business combined with small business banking, you're
going to grow small business relationships by 15% to 20% and the revenues by 25% to 30%. I don't see any slide
for that.
And I know you've got – look, you've got Union Bank deal, you had the issues of last March and April, and it's
okay, your capital is back. The deal is done. And now, we're back to kind of U.S. Bancorp business as usual. So,
I'm just trying to look for some color on that if you're going to become the square of banking or if that's still a goal
and how those revenues might help you improve that efficiency.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Sure, Mike. And it is still a goal. We do think this combination of payments and business banking and providing
that comprehensive product set and capabilities to help people run their business is a key strategic priority and
continues to be. And I think the fee categories that John mentioned are also a key driver of revenue including
payments, commercial products, trust, and investment, and those are all areas that we expect continued growth
on. The immediate pressure on net interest income is what's causing us not to get positive operating leverage in
the short-term, but it is something that I believe and as John mentioned, will abate and start to grow into the
second half of 2024.
And so, I think we're going to get to the positive operating leverage. We are planning on it, and we will continue to
drive that efficiency ratio down certainly into the high 50s at the beginning and continue to deliver positive
operating leverage to get it even lower. That's our objective.

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Correct.

John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then, just stepping back, like, any other kind of small businesses or segments that you're kind of the
re-evaluating for not so much kind of the regulatory proposals which we'll see how they finalize, but just other
areas that you're stepping back and whether it's in mortgage, [ph] getting a (00:33:08) smaller market there, or
other parts of the business portfolio that you're looking either to exit or to potentially lean into that's a bit different
than you were thinking say six months ago?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I can start, and Andy can chime in. I think we've commented on the ATM business. I mean, you're constantly
evaluating certain things, particularly in light of regulatory change. Clearly, a lot of comment letters have been
submitted in terms of the Basel III endgame. At the end of the day, it's not going to materially drive whether we
exit or – businesses or enter new businesses, that sort of thing. It's just going to be a combination of continual
investment, as Andy mentioned in terms of what we need to do toward achieving positive operating leverage and
managing around regulatory actions. Those are some of the comments I'd throw out there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I think, I agree, John. And the only thing I'd add is, the environment and the competitive dynamic is something that
causes us to be more aggressive or less aggressive in certain categories. Maybe an example I'll give you is auto
lending, which is for us is not growing right now and that's because of the spreads and the returns are just not at
our levels that we want to put on the books. So, those are areas that we're going to not get out of or close down,
but just not emphasize in terms of growth at the levels of returns that we're seeing right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then, historically in credit card, we're obviously seeing a normalization of losses with you guys and
throughout the industry and also very strong growth. So, if we adjust losses kind of on a lagged basis, they are
above a few years ago. At what point do you tighten up credit card and say we should slow growth at this point in
the cycle, or do you think there is still quite a bit of runway of call it good growth or healthy growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Administration Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Well, I mean, it is an area, Matt, that we think there continues to be nice growth in that particular space. It is
an area, though, that certainly as we have looked at the economic uncertainties and those sorts of things, the
pressure on consumers, especially given the inflationary sort of pressure, we – on the margin around the edges,
we do make adjustments to underwriting and tighten that up where we need to. But when you end up kind of

thinking about the overall credit performance of credit card business, we still think it's a very nice business. We
focus on prime, super prime sort of customers. And even through this cycle, I think it's going to perform very well.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
John, you touched on, in answering a question about commercial loan growth that some of your customers were
accessing the capital markets and things of that nature. Can you guys share with us – we read a lot and see a lot
about the private credit markets have really become quite active and aggressive in making loans to corporate and
commercial customers. Are you guys seeing that competition, number one? And also, is it any different than past
years, or has it intensified?
And then, simultaneously, are any of these private Apollo, Blackstone, et cetera, are these customers of yours?
And if they are, how do you balance the competition versus handling their needs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure, this is John, Gerard. So, in terms of on the commercial side, when I comment that going to the capital
markets is more or less the public markets. So, taking bond issuance to – in the public investment-grade market.
We tend not to see them or compete on the private credit side of things. It's just not a structure or type of loan
type in terms of our client base that we tend to run into. So, it's more or less – I can't say it's increased or
decreased versus because we just don't see those names. We compete in the commercial space with our peer
banks more or less in that particular venue.
In terms of – you mentioned in terms of client interaction, we have great relationships with a number of different
names in terms of investment services, capital markets activities, other sorts of categories. So, we do have some
very nice relationships with those institutions.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Administration Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I think the last thing I would just add is that depending upon where the capital rules end up and what sort of –
where the emphasis is or isn't, you could see more or less moving into the private capital sort of markets. They
tend to have more flexibility in terms of structure. They take on more risk, all sorts of things. Again, it may not be
where we compete, but certainly from an industry standpoint, private credit continues to be an area of focus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you, Terry. Just if we step back for a moment and look at beyond Basel III endgame, maybe we do get the
final proposal in the middle of this year or later this year, we get through the next DFAST. U.S. Bancorp has
always had a hallmark of having one of the highest ROTCEs amongst the regional banks. Obviously, you're
probably going to maintain that. But you also were very disciplined in giving back the excess capital every year to
shareholders in buybacks and dividends. Generally, if I recall correctly, around 75% to 80% of total earnings in a
combination of both. Andy, do you see that coming on the horizon maybe 2025 once we get all the rules set and
you know what your CET1 ratio needs to be? What's your outlook there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Gerard. We do achieve a high return on tangible common, I mentioned 19% to 20% fourth quarter versus
full year of 2024. And as we think about going forward, I would expect us to continue to lead the pack in terms of
that return which is key to generating capital to key to returning capital. And again, once we get clarity on the rules
as I mentioned earlier in both the Basel III endgame as well as the CCAR process and determine our target
capital levels, we will return the difference either through dividends or buybacks [ph] has (00:40:00) been our
history.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just to follow-up on the deposit side, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about
starting to moderate pricing a little bit and you also talked about roll-off of higher cost deposits. Just wondering if
you can amplify both of those comments. So, what types of products or tweaks are you already being able to
make on the deposit pricing front? And then, where did those higher-cost deposits flow out of from a business
perspective? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. Thanks, Ken. The comment was really around in terms of the fourth quarter and just what we saw. Maybe
just stepping back a bit, in the third quarter, we grew deposits quite a bit, and part of that was we were just getting
through the Union Bank acquisition. We wanted to make sure we were maintaining strong relationships with those
clients and really all clients as we were going through those times.
In the fourth quarter, given where loan demand went and where we had a little bit of excess of deposits, so we
made decisions really just tactically to go away from non-deposits – or non-relationship – or less relationship
based and specifically on time deposits declining and things of that nature. So, I think that's just going to be the
ebb and flow of things of just how we manage it going forward depending on loan growth, depending on our
profile, and depending on the relationship. So, that's really what that comment was intended for.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
And importantly, John, on our core consumer deposits, we are continuing to see growth there, as you mentioned.
That's what we had in the slide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A

structure, and also, that's kind of making sure you're buttoned up as a starting point? Has that base of loans and
deposits gotten to a steady state as well?

Good morning.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Maybe on the payments side, can you just add a little bit more detail about how you're feeling about your
payments strategy and how you're doing and how big the upside opportunity is there? Obviously you're growing
nicely on the issuing side, the merchant acquiring side, sort of mid-single digit growth in revenues and volumes. I
think you said high-single digit next year. I mean, as you guys know, the banks have ceded a lot of share to
software companies, integrated service providers, and just how do you feel it's going in terms of integrating your
commercial banking and payments offering?
And it does seem like you have a major advantage in terms of having relationships both on the retail and
commercial side, and obviously you kind of have that two-sided network that a lot of the FinTechs want, but
obviously banks have struggled in this area. So, just maybe if you can just give us sort of an overview of how
you're doing and how you feel the opportunity set is evolving.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Saul. So, first of all, the high-single digits on merchant processing is a function of the investments we've
made and the initiatives we have underway. And I would highlight two things. Number one is our tech-led initiative
which is now up over 30% of our activities related to tech-led. So that is integrating our merchant processing
capabilities into the software that people use to run their businesses.
And number two is this whole integration of banking and payments that we've talked about earlier. And the
advantage I do believe that we have is that we are not just providing one single service. We're integrating banking
services, deposit lending capabilities, treasury management together with payments and money movement into
one comprehensive offering that helps people again run their business, particularly small businesses and helps
them ease into the process of payments activity in a comprehensive way together with the software they're using
to run their company.
So, those are the initiatives that we have underway. And that continues to be a huge focus. And one that I do
think differentiates us a little bit because of the capabilities we have in payments and that's true of merchant
processing, corporate payments, as well as retail issuing.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2024
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Maybe I'll just follow up on deposits. You mentioned the migration. You expect the
migration out of non-interest bearing deposits to sort of run its course. Just when and where do you see that? I
think non-interest bearing was 17.5% of total deposits. How much more room is there? And just on deposit cost, I
think the cumulative beta, if my calculation is right, is around 49%. How much more room is there for that to
increase or what's embedded in your guidance for NII?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. So in terms of the NIB, I think we've talked quite a bit about it. And I would just – I mean, we're at a certain
percentage that you mentioned and we're going to be around that area. It certainly could drift a little lower. But we
are at a point where from a core standpoint, particularly on the commercial and small business side where you're
starting to get into places where companies have to run operating accounts and over time you're going to have
account growth and things of that variety. So, I think they'll be conducive to supporting NIB going forward.
But there will be some leftover churn, as I alluded to earlier in the call. In terms of beta, as you mentioned, 48.5%
or so percent is our beta right now. I think it can creep up as we've kind of talked about, but it's going to depend
on when the Fed cuts is going to be, kind of, that focus point in terms of how much it will go from here. And so,
how – what level is hard to predict, but there will be pressure until the Fed starts cutting.
